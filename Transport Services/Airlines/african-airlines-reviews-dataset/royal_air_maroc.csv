"I traveled here in August of 2019. I would typically fly every year of my 26 years of life to visit. This time, they lost ONLY my luggage out of 6 other bags (which happened to have a lot of new and expensive gifts for family members). I was stuck in morocco for 3 weeks wearing my brothers clothing and had to buy clothing for myself. (Which they never reimbursed me for). After a lot of time going back and forth to get them to acknowledge my lost luggage, agreeing to only pay $400 USD (well over 2k in my luggage). They have actually been completely ignoring all of my emails for the last 2 years. I am finally going to take them to small claims court and get my tiny $400. For me, it is the fact that they have been blatantly ignoring me, thinking that I will get tired of emailing and just forget about it so they dont have to pay me. Nope. See you in court!

"I am so disappointed in the service I have received from Royal Air Maroc. They cancelled mine and 3 of my friends' flights from Malaga to Marrakech in March 2020. Despite having to chase them at least once a week we are yet to receive a refund of our plane fares as we have been promised for the past two years. The customer service whilst polite is unacceptable as all they do is send an email to their accounts team and nothing gets done. I have had no explanations as to why my funds have not been returned, it seems as if they are waiting for me to get bored and forget about the refund. When you are due over 600 euros it is just not going to happen. I would definitely not book a flight with this airline again, other airlines are much more responsive and helpful and don't try and retain funds that are not theirs to keep.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellypF2274YO,Kelly P wrote a review Nov 15,Kelly P,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Malaga - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r868553398-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Failure to provide a refund due to cancelled flight,Date of travel: December 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My 1st flight sat on the tarmac for 50 mins, so I missed my connecting flight and had to wait in Casablanca for 24 hours. The agent at the gate took my passport and gave it back to the wrong person. I lost my passport for 3 hours. The agent at baggage service yelled at me because she didn’t want to do her job and retrieve my bags that were practically sitting in front of the room. I had to pull my bags out or else I don’t have any clothes and toiletries. I asked for her name or employee id #, so I could file a complaint. She refused and kept yelling at me even louder. Horrendous attitudes for someone working in customer service. Then they lost one of my 3 checked bags. All this in one trip. I missed an event of which I was the host and got in troubles at work because of this delay. Also no wifi onboard (not even paid wifi). No apologies from them so far. No compensation whatsoever. I’m a frequent flyer (15+ international  flights a year). I’ll never fly with them again and strongly recommend others not to. That was the first and the last. Minus -10 stars if this website allows.

"I booked our flights and THEN read all these terrible reviews, and I must say, I was petrified but our experience was not so bad. I will list Pros and Cons but first a few disclaimers: we did NOT check any luggage, so I cannot verify for this aspect, and we did NOT eat any of the meals, as we got to the airport super early and decided to pay for a lounge at the airport. I highly recommend this! Most airports have the option to buy in to the lounge for about $50/person if you're not a member already, and it's worth it. All the food and drinks you want, relaxing atmosphere and even showers. So we weren't hungry for the flight and it was a great start to vacation.

Pros:
This airline is the only one that offers a quick flight to Marrakech. All of our friends had insanely long layovers in Paris or Madrid from the States, and we flew directly to Casablanca with a 1 hour layover and easily made it to our 50 min. flight to RAK. This alone made the airline worth it.
All of our flights (JFK-Casablanca-Marrakech and reverse) left on time or within 15 mins.
The airplane was NOT filthy as other reviewers emphasized. I brought wipes just in case but did not use them.
The flight attendants were friendly enough. I've had way ruder on Lufthansa and Delta.
Our request for bulkhead or exit row when we checked in at the airport was accommodated each time. And thank goodness because.....

Cons
The seats are UNBELIEVABLY narrow. My husband is 6'5 and built like a linebacker and no way could he have sat in any other row. I was in the middle seat in our exit row and his arm was in my lap, as was the stranger in the aisle seat. I had 2 men leaning on me the whole time. There will always be a middle seat on these planes. You will have people touching you. I am 5'4 and 120 and I barely fit. BOOK THE EXIT ROW.
The bathrooms close to us ran out of toilet paper about 5 hours into a 7 hour flight. Both directions.
There is not a lot of service. I got up to go back and ask for water and the flight attendant told me ""It's coming"" only to wait an hour. Bring your own drinks for sure.
The other passengers were stressed out boarding and debarking, freaking out about connections, etc. I think this is just passengers flying these days however. The attendants basically ignored them, but I wish they would command more order and calm during these times.

So to wrap up, upgrade to first class if you're large or paranoid about touching others, but ABSOLUTELY get an exit row or the bulkhead. It will make all the difference. Bring your own water. Pack lightly so you're not stressed out (you don't need a lot in Morroco anyway...it's hot and just handwash your clothes)
The almost direct flight alone is good enough reason that I'd definitely book with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyTX123,Daisy T. wrote a review Nov 9,Daisy T.,,8 contributions,,New York City - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r867845935-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Not as terrible as these reviews!,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were flying from Marrakech to Cairo through Casablanca on Royal Air Maroc (RAM). I read enough bad reviews of the airline to consider driving from Marrakech to Casablanca, just to avoid any problems with the first leg of the flight. But given that we had a 3-hour layover in Casablanca, I figured that we could tolerate a delay on the first leg.

Silly me. The flight to Casablanca was delayed about 3 hours, resulting in us missing the flight to Cairo. RAM rebooked us on a flight about 10 hours later, an overnight flight rather than the daytime flight that we were supposed to be on. We therefore missed (forfeited) a nonrefundable night in a nice hotel in Cairo at a cost of over $500 for two rooms. Furthermore, RAM didn't put out luggage on that flight, even though they had 10 hours to do so. We were in Cairo for one day then flew to Luxor for the next two. They wouldn't deliver the luggage to Luxor so we didn't get it until returning to Cairo. That's four days wearing the same clothes. Then it took 2-3 hours in the Cairo airport with Egyptair Baggage Services to get our luggage, just so we could have it for the last half day before returning to the US.

Avoid this airline. I'm sure that things go well most of the time, but they can go very badly more often than with most other airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/24/62/0c/3b/jrkey.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrkey,jrkey wrote a review Nov 1,jrkey,"Middleton, Wisconsin",27 contributions,16 helpful votes,Marrakech - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r866856990-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Delayed flight, missed connection, and no luggage for 4 days",Date of travel: October 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have been a few times flying with RAM...mainly because they are one of the few airlines that fly direct to casa... every journey gets more farcical...this time around was the dreadful service at casa on the way to marakech... bearing in mind my seat had broken before take off in the UK and the area where I was sitting smelt oddly of cigarettes!! Anyway we landed after a delay and literally had to RUN through Casa airport to get our connecting flight...yes another RAM flight... unfortunately this was all relayed in Arabic... so only half the flight knew what was happening.

"Strengths:
-Usually you get a layover in Casablanca, and if you do, stay in Four Seasons. It will change your life.
-If business class isn't filled up, they charge ~$750 for upgrade to biz class, but you can only do it within 24 hours. Thats an amazing price compared to other airlines who charge thousands

Weaknesses:
-Their computer system isn't connected with their telephone customer service representatives. Usually you have to call an agent over and over to get the right answer. These people aren't trained properly, not to mention the constant static when trying to speak with someone.
-An agent will say biz class is full, but if go online it will say it is available -- and it usually is available
-My wife and I tried purchasing biz class (last minute). My wife got upgraded and even though I paid for my upgrade, for some reason it didn't go through. I asked agents at the ticket counter but they kept telling me it was full. Half of my family was flying business class. They told me they saw 6 empty biz class seats. What is 6X750? $4500. Now extrapolate that to the nth degree for all flights under RAM. Thats how much money RAM is losing daily because of their ineffective and inefficient systems.

Bottom Line... Will I continue to fly RAM?

Sadly... yes. The flight isn't bad. Some of the comments below are a little exaggerating. But at the end of the day, if I can pay $750 for an upgrade to biz class, compared to the thousands I would have to pay at United, its worth the gamble for me.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/00/dd/40/omar-f.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724omarf,Omar F wrote a review Oct 2022,Omar F,,28 contributions,31 helpful votes,Casablanca - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r865943191-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Very unorganized,Date of travel: October 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I traveled from Washington Dulles to Barcelona at the beginning of August 2022. I normally try to do carry-on only when traveling, but I packed a few extra items for a friend who I was meeting in Barcelona and had to use a larger bag that I checked in. Unfortunately, that was the last time that I saw that bag until 2.5 months later. I received no compensation, no call about tracking, and I was never able to reach anyone on the telephone or email to track my bag. I submitted an online claim 21 days after the bag was lost as the airline requested, which I don't think they ever checked.

"What a shambles of an airline. A true score of 0. Our flight to Casablanca was 45 minutes late boarding (no real issue with that), we then sat on the tarmac for 2.5hrs. Little or no explanation and when any announcement was made it was first in Arabic with then a limited announcement in English, after 2.5hrs of waiting on the plane the flight was cancelled, reason - apparently that due to Gatwick airport issues, this had caused the pilot to run out of flying hours. Many of our fellow passengers mainly Moroccans told us that this was not an unusual occurrence with RAM. We then had to disembark, go through emigration, collect our luggage and head back to the check-in desk. We were then each given a food voucher for M&S Food and then had to wait to be allocated a hotel for the night. We were lucky, but some passengers were allocated rooms in hotels at Heathrow, while other passengers opted to sleep on the floor at Gatwick. Overnight we received an email advising us to be back at Gatwick by 5am for an 8am flight.

Having queued from 5am for 2 hours at check-in finally someone appeared only to tell us he was only there to issue vouchers for breakfast and knew nothing about the flight, so don’t ask. My partner put a comment up on twitter about the time we were waiting to check-in, which got a comment from Gatwick airport that check-in’s open 3 hours before a flight, totally missing the point.
The pilot and aircrew then appeared but just seemed to be amused by our predicament, even when some Moroccan passengers spoke to them in Arabic, they gave the appearance of not our problem. At 7:30am check-in started for an 8am flight, the boarding cards had no flight time and when we tried to go through immigration the barriers remained firmly closed, so over 150 passengers had to queue up to go through the manual barrier. By 11:30am we were once again sitting on the plane, but the luggage still hadn’t been loaded. While we waited the crew just ignored us, and no offer was made of even a drink. Finally, at 1pm the luggage was loaded and the flight eventually took off around 1:30pm. During the whole flight unless you asked, no food or drink was provided and then only water or beer and a bread roll. The toilets were dirty and smelly, no attempt was made by the crew to clean them, and the crew just sat up the back of the plane avoiding the passengers. The only passengers who were looked after were the 3 in business class. When we landed the crew thanked us for our custom and hoped to see us soon on another flight, you can guess the reaction that got……..

Since the flight we have had emails from their customer services team, the first to say they would look into any compensation claim and the second asking for a review of their service.

"We have taken numerous airlines to Europe and back and yesterday we experienced one of the worst flights  back to the US.  It starts with the booking process. No order whatsoever. Everyone just storms the gate causing major delays getting on the plane. Next came the seats which were so close everyone was in pain most of the 8 plus hour flight. The seat cushions have little to no padding I ended up sitting on my pillow and blanket. Next, nothing on the plane worked. The USB ports for both us would not work, my wife's entertainment system did not work and the choices of movies and shows are 30 years old..  I could not put my seat back and the guy in front of me put his all the way back giving me even less room.  I saw one guy in the last row who could not recline his seat.  He was a tall guy whose head was higher than his seat.  His head had to rest on a piece of metal behind his seat.  He tried putting his pillow behind him and looked really upset. The food was horrible. Tuna fish sandwiches as a snack that most people didn't eat. The bathrooms were disgusting by the end of the trip.  No crew monitor their condition and toilet paper ran out and diapers were on the floor.  By the time we landed we felt as if we were beaten up with sore backs and pains.  Avoid this airline for long haul flights.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/5e/69/c7/colleen-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenr102,John R wrote a review Sep 2022,John R,,16 contributions,2 helpful votes,Casablanca - Miami,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r860933528-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Terrible Long Haul Flight,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I do not even understand how anyone can say this is a decent airline and why no one is talking about how filthy the planes are.  I flew them twice - from Cairo to Casablanca and then Casablanca to the U.S.  Both flight experiences were awful.  Both flights had planes that were absolutely disgusting.  There were visible stains, dirt, and grime on all surfaces.  The tray tables had visible stains and were not cleaned.  The lavatories did not look like they had ever been cleaned.  There was clear build-up of grime from what looks like years of not cleaning the interior of the plane.  The food was not edible at all.  On one flight, there was no vegetarian option at all, which didn't matter because the food was terrible.  On the almost 6-hour flight from Cairo to Casablanca, there was no in-flight entertainment.  On the flight from Casablanca to the U.S., the in-flight entertainment was not working in several of the seats (either not working at all or the sound not working).  The flight attendant said he would reset the system but that did not happen.  Also the seat pockets were all torn and you could see dirt and debris inside them.  Oh, and I cannot forget to mention that the ground crew in Cairo did not bother to put my luggage (and several other passangers' luggage) on the plane to Casablanca!  I had a direct flight with no transfers!!!  And of course, customer service was not helpful with retrieving my luggage, which eventually I did get.The planes need some serious deep cleaning.  I could not wait to get off the plane because it was so gross.  What happened to cleaning and disinfecting the planes for COVID protocols?!

"This is honestly the worst airline to travel if you have kids. This is especially true for the return flight leaving Casablanca. It is already established that it takes so long between walking in through the aeroport doors (luggage scan queues) and reaching the boarding gate (security and immigration). But Royal Air Maroc managed to make this worse:

1- Once your reach the check in counter areas, RAM has a first passport checks to ensure you are a the right place, here people with their luggage have to form a long single queue managed by two employees only. This the first fail point because the line goes out into the open space where all the airport users are walking. It goes without saying that many people ended up cutting the line depending on which side they ended up approaching.

2- Once you clear this first line, you end up queueing at the checkin counters without possibility to leave or your have to go through fail point 1 again. Parents, like us, picked one of the 5 or 6 lines and settled our luggage and kids waiting for our turn. The wait is notoriously long but that isnt the issue. After 20 mins of waiting, the issue started when the RAM agent handling our line decided to cut the line in half and asked us to move to the other lines because ""she was done for the day"". The line was already long and people got obviously upset because logically it is easier to just replace the agent at the counter with one who is just starting their shift rather than move 20+ parents, kids and their luggage. This where we realized that other checkin counters where opened up and many people behind us ended up at the front of these new queues. This is all exacerbated because by kids becoming restless, neededing a snack or potty. This fail point 2. It is worth noting that this checkin was handling 3 US flights at the same time leaving within an hour of each other. We ended up waiting for an hour and 20 mins to get boarding passes.

3- After an emergency toilet break for everyone, we made our way through security and immigration, to my surprise this was the easiest part of the whole experience. It took us less than 15mins because they had enough staff and enough passport control agents to make the process faster. We stopped for a half an hour lunch and made our way to RAM fail point 3. We boarded at gate A10 which managed by ONE SOLE RAM agent. Only one agent was handling 100+ people. At this point we had to get rid of our waters (the notorious preboard security check for US flights) so between getting on the plane and being able to ask for water for kids took 1 hours plus.

4- This is not a fail point but rather some stupid decision. Because, of the delays with boarding and issues with seating configurations once onboard (there was one fight between two ladies about middle seats this middle seats that) the flight took off late and somehow they decided that it was better to get us to JFK 45mins early...now once we got to the US and we landed! There was nowhere for the plane to go because there was still a flight at the assigned gate. Bathrooms were closed a good 40 mins before landing and we had to wait on land for 30 mins without any access to bathrooms or water. Many kids were crying restless and everyone was super tired. It was the worst decision to make at that point in time to actually land early.

After arrivals, we had to wait a long while for luggage but that was nothing new or unexpected.

Bottom line, this airline does not account for the wellbeing of kids at any point during your interaction with them. It's one thing to treat grown ups as cattle but it is rather absurd to expect under 10 years old to be patient for something delayed because of sheer incompetence.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Savouvi2021,MoroccanTraveller2022 wrote a review Sep 2022,MoroccanTraveller2022,,1 contribution,,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r858341094-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst Airline If You Have Kids,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flying experience was decent, no frills and no tricks. Cabin crew were polite and helpful. Food options were either ""chicken or beef"".  A third option e.g. fish or vegeterian would be good. The main negative aspect of using this airline are the disgraceful toilet facilities at Casablanca Airport (Mohammed V International). The cleaning of the toilets on both out and return legs were unworthy of an international airport.

At my second attempt to call, he put me on hold right away without listening to me and without anyone replying while I was waiting on hold.

Coming back on AT 218, once again my wife did not have a working entertainment system for the whole flight.  Food was mediocre, and in flight service mediocre too.  Check in staff in both airports were good.  Gate at CMN was bad; air conditioning anemic to non-existent on a hot day.

"How this airline can continue to operate is beyond me! They should be totally ashamed of themselves! The promotional videos playing constantly state they are customer service based, & that they pride themselves on delivering the best in the airline industry - this is laughable, & the polar opposite!

The flight from Fes to Casablanca was delayed for over an hour with NO EXPLAINATION as to why, & with no apology... Making the connecting flight to Tunisia impossible...

Upon arriving at Casablanca, the only flight on that day was 7.5-hours later! Again, with no explaination or apology, we were all simply pointed into a room, new boarding passes/tickets were issued, & that was that! It was not until another man asked about breakfast/lunch/or even a drink, that the remaining people like myself (who had not yet figured out what to do or where to go) waited for a response... Begrudgingly, the woman told him in Arabic to go to the Oasis Lounge...

Upon arriving at the Oasis Lounge, the same man had to argue our case to be let in!!! After a heated phone call, the sour-faced woman finally did let us all in... There was nothing but coffee available & a few lounges left to get some rest on...

The same man argued something in Arabic, & finally, the woman handed over our bit of paper to us, whereby it stated we were eliguble to get breakfast from a fast food place upstairs... This was to sustain us until our flight that night (that departed an hour late, again with no explaination!)

The 'breakfast' consisted of x1 VERY SMALL water, x1 small burnt coffee, & x1 dry tasteless croissant!!!
Since leaving Fes medina at 2am for the 5.30am flight departure that actually departed at 6.48am no food or drink was available at the closed Fes airport cafes... No in-flight food or drink was supplied either... So because we had no Moroccan money left (as we were leaving) & no one accepted credit card, we were left with NOTHING to drink until we arrived in Tunisia that night at 1am!!!!!!

Royal Air Maroc has absolutely nothing 'royal' about it to offer! They should be disgusted with their lack of customer service!!! Seriously, this is only the basics of how bad things were!

I would strongly recommend using any other airline in place of this mickey-mouse, shambles of an airline!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/7d/a6/1b/elle-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/143elled,Elle D wrote a review Jul 2022,Elle D,South America,11 contributions,2 helpful votes,Fes - Tunis,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r850177619-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Absolutely APPALLING!!!!!!,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Outbound and Inbound, bad experience. Missed my connection at Casablanca as flight was delayed and there was no one to open the doors when we landed, so 50+ people missed their connection flights.
Return, they lost my suitcase, could not tell me if it left my departure location or was not transferred t my connected flight to Paris.
After few days chasing them and the delivery/courier company, they could not even give me the number of the courier company they use, I had to find it myself online.
One of the lady staff did not even let me speak when I was complaining and asking her a question. Only positive point was the cabin crew, which I have to say was nice. But too many issues, so I will not fly again with RAM.

"So, on June 21, 2022, I traveled via Royal Air Maroc aircraft AT554 from Lagos, Nigeria. I believed Royal Air Maroc would make up for the hassle of dealing with Nigerian customs with good service. When she first said welcome aboard, the air hostess appeared irate because some of the passengers were whispering in their language about the people outside the plane. I immediately realized the service would be subpar. Nobody checked the passengers for seatbelts as the plane was preparing to take off. There is no in-flight entertainment or screen on the trip. Just picture spending hours in a plane with no entertainment.

The service was just as bad as the food. Because the journey from Morocco to the US was so fantastic, I think this kind of treatment is just too poor and awful.

"QUICK SUMMARY OF ADVICE:

Even if AirMaroc has the cheapest option for your travel, opt for a more reputable airline as you will not get your money back for years, if at all, even if AirMaroc cancels your flight!

HOW I LEARNED THE ABOVE:

I bought a flight from Dulles Airport in Washington, DC to Carthage, Tunis in early 2021. As I was gearing up to depart, AirMaroc sent an email saying that the second leg of my flight (layover in Morocco) was cancelled and automatically rebooked for me....3 days after my first leg arrives in Morocco. My 4-hour layover had turned into a 72-hour layover. This didn't work at all, so I called AirMaroc to cancel the flight. The Customer Service agent tried to convince me to keep the flight and ""spend some time in Morocco and see the sights"", but given COVID-19 I wouldn't really be able to anything other than hunker down in the hotel that *I* would have to book.

She finally let me cancel the flight, but said I would receive travel credit. If I didn't use that travel credit in 12 months, then I could get it refunded in cash. Fine, I said -- I'll wait a year and submit the refund (seems kind of crazy that they cancelled my flight and now want me to wait a year to receive my money back, but whatever).

A year went by.

I submitted my refund request in February 2022, and it has now been four months that I am waiting for them to give me back my money. I have jumped through a crazy number of hoops (***including giving them my banking information???***) and I have yet to receive my money. I have sent many emails to AirMaroc to which I never received any response. I then resorted to calling Customer Service, and by now have called at least 10 times to request an update -- every time I receive no information other than ""it is being processed.""

Simply put, four months is an unacceptable period of time for refund processing.

I understand that there is a lot of work, but I cannot accept that there has been so much work that a customer should wait four months to receive a refund. As such, the logical conclusion is that AirMaroc does not intend to return the money that rightfully belongs to me.

I highly advise anyone thinking of flying with AirMaroc to avoid the company. I initially booked them because they were the cheapest, but booking with them has turned out to be far more expensive than if I had just booked with a reputable company in the first place.

Learn from my mistake: choose to do give your business to reputable airlines that care about their customers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmw19922544,Nick W wrote a review Jun 2022,Nick W,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Washington DC - Tunis,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r841736020-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Complete Lack of Organization and Extremely Slow Administration,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We missed our original flight to Casablanca from Lisbon on May 13 and Royal Air Marco was operating the only other flight for the day. The flight itself was fine, we landed safely and I don’t ask for much more (thank you to the pilots!). I’m leaving a review mostly so other unsure fliers have a realistic idea of what to expect. The plane itself was all but filthy and I would find it VERY hard to believe if someone were to tell me that it had been even partially sanitized between flights. There was a literal blood spatter on the seat back tray table, and the little cover that protects the open lever on the emergency exit window/door kept falling off. I wish I had taken photos for you all bc it was a mess; unfortunately I was busy trying to keep down my anxiety. Lol. Most of the guests onboard refused to wear their masks and some literally just stood in the aisles hollering to each other the entire flight.

"I was flying several times with RAM. The service has always been rather bad...
The planes are old, some electronic TVs were not working...and every single time was my seat spot dirty!! No coincidence. It can happen one time...
Disgusting food leftovers on my buckle of the seatbelt. Really terrible!
The staff is not well trained at all.
The worst experience was last time: my flight from Casablanca...
I had NO hand lugguage...my suitcase was overweight for 2,1 kg.
Basically nothing! The girl on the desk asked for €uro 500,00!!!
I told her many times that I am not paying that and that it could NEVER cost that much.
Her English was so bad, also the guy she called had no English skills at all!!
He was her supervisor...all he could do was being arrogant. Telling me to check the restrictions online. I did and told him it would be €uro 50,00 max!
Such a joke. He didn´t even apologized and said sorry for his grave fault.
Such an embarassing behavior.
Even Marrocan people behind me told them in their language how inappropriate their behaviour is.
I got really mad afterwards when I paid and saw in the dirty plane that it was almost empty! So why did I pay overweight? Ungenerously!
Exploit Western people is all they can.
In fact: dirty + old planes, no language skills, rude and trying to ripp of rich tourists.
Sad!! Wannabe country and the easiest things do not work...I hope the new airline will be much better than ROYAL AIR MAROC! Fail!!!
PLUS, they didn´t tell anyone who was not wearing their mask to do so.
They do not care about anything.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vioh2022,Vio H wrote a review May 2022,Vio H,,2 contributions,,Casablanca - Frankfurt,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r839939999-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Bad service, zero language skills, arrogant, old & dirty planes - super expensive fees for overweight",Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked a ticket (10/16/21) to see my boyfriends family for the holidays. I was set to depart on 12/23/21 and they cancelled the flight on 12/14/21 due to ""covid"" and did not offer any protection on another airline even though other airlines were flying. I had to buy a very expensive late purchase ticket on British Airways. I think they must not have had a full flight so they canceled and kept everyones money because refund they promised never came. When I called the 7-10 days turned into 30, then 30 more when I called again, and so on. By the time I realized this was a scam and called Bank of America to dispute the Visa charge in early April, the bank said it was past 60 days and they would not help me (slimy move on their part!)
The reservation line at Royal Air Maroc is not working (it cut the call when I press that option). The refund option goes to a ""general mail box"" that is full and the U.S. number for their Florida office is no longer in service. I think I'm screwed but don't let this happen to you!.
I paid $1055 for this ticket ~ no small sum for a teacher! I had to pay $2400 for my late purchase BA ticket so this has really hurt me financially.

"Royal Air Maroc absolutely exceeded my expectations. Better than any US domestic or European airline I have flown.
Both ways the planes were spotless. Entertainment systems worked well. Only complaint was that natural English language for movies was very hushed so I felt it was hard to hear.
Where they excelled was food and drink service. Very efficient and the food was much better than normal airline meals. I ordered a gluten free meal in advance, I actually forgot I had done it, but it was delivered prior to regular meal service. Very quick service and I loved the tea and coffee service.
Economy seats were comfortable and, relative to competitors, pretty roomy. My only suggestion would be to offer a premium economy or larger leg room section.

If you are having any issue with a refund, request a chargeback from your bank immediately.

For anything else the phone operator will try to contact another part of the business, or a manager. Strangely at that moment in time you called, that's never possible for some BS reasons.

"The experience with this airline has been nothing but disappointing. Firstly, I booked a flight to Nigeria from the UK in 2020. They cancelled the flight and moved it back from 17 Dec to 23 Dec without an explanation. Then the flight on the 23rd was cancelled due to lockdown. I wasn't told in the first instance I was entitled to an immediate refund so I took a voucher. At the end of 12 months I was entitled to a refund but am yet to receive it. I have received conflicting advice from their ""customer care"" department on every single phone call I have made. Staff are, with one or two exceptions, incredibly rude and aggressive. Despite two of their team telling me that I could process the refund myself in the first instance, other team members have point blank refused to process my refund and have also refused to pass me on to complaints team/team dealing with refunds/a senior manager and have laid the responsibility solely with the travel agent to process the refund.

You know the hassle I have to face, the stress of checking alternatives and to call the call center overseas. It's a very very bad experience with RAM. I never encountered this in any other airlines. There was only 20 days before my flight before they cancelled it. I have to pay 1000 aed extra for another flight in another airline.

"After reading dozens for negative reviews about Royal Air Marco,  from lost luggage, flight delays, flight cancellations, poor service, lack of lounges and a hard to use mobile app, I was reluctant to fly with them.  Yesterday was either an exception or else Royal Air Marco gets very poor press.  Other than having to change terminals from Terminal 5 to 2 in London, things could not have been better.  Once on board Sara our cabin attendant was a dream.  She recommended Moroccan delights for our meal which was 1st class and to local Moroccan wines.  Our appetizer included perfectly smoke Salmon, with Moroccan Potato Salad.  Order the Beef Tagine if they offer it to you.  You will be amazed with the flavors.   My wife picked her brain about where to shop and for what.  Once again Sara was amazing.  This young woman made our 3.5 hour flight fun.  He eyes sparkled when she talked about Morocco and all there is to do there. Flight 3474 from LHR to CMN has 12 business class seats (very average 737).  Our flight was on time leaving and arriving.  Our luggage was waiting for us once we got through Passport control.  We parked away from jetways so we had to be transported to the terminal.  Business class had a very nice coach to take us to the terminal.  Everyone else took typical airport transport buses.  We had people help us with loading our carryon luggage while those in economy had to fend for themselves.American Airlines adding them to OneWorld at least for us was perfect.  I am writing today to help fix a very bad picture of this airline.  Sure there are language issues.  Knowing a little French helps.

"The airline itself is fine.  I had an ordinary budget airline experience although the price was much higher than other airlines, so I would consider other carriers next time.  Most of the staff is very friendly, professional and a joy to interact with.  I have no real complaints about customer service other than long hold time when I had to call a few times due to changes related to COVID (government mandated) flight cancelations last year.  The other passengers are what made it a challenging experience at times and I am always stunned by lack of basic manners from fellow travelers.  At any rate, that is not the RAM's fault, but it seemed like keeping the plane clean for example (aisles & bathrooms) were difficult for the RAM staff.  It was quite unpleasant at times as a passenger if you had to use the restroom.  There were also way too many people allowed to walk around and and also stand in your already limited space throughout the flight. Not my first choice, but would not be terrible if I had to fly with RAM again although I'd try to upgrade or at least choose a better seat and one closer to the front of the plane.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/84/avatar005.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyQTraveler,Sandy Q wrote a review Apr 2022,Sandy Q,"Malibu, California",250 contributions,51 helpful votes,Los Angeles - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r833859888-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Average Airline,Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I couldn't do this so opted to fly to Heathrow on the return the same day. This presented problems as my car would be at Gatwick. I called the UK Air Maroc offices and after waiting around 30 minutes in an online queue finally got through to a service agent. having argued the point he finally agreed to allow me to make the change 'without charge'......are they mad.....they cancelled on me! They also refused to provide a transfer to Gatwick so I could collect my car......they cancelled not me but I'm left to pick up the bills.

"We understood COVID would strain customers and staff. But Royal Air Maroc is incomprehensibly terrible across all fronts. In peak times, the phone lines (there are multiple) will keep hanging up on you with no reasoning. We had to call dozens of times.

The representatives were mostly rude and unhelpful. If you make them angry they give up and refuse to offer service. We thought this was just the phone line, but when we finally flew, we found it was their attitude at both Fez and Marrakech. When faced with a problem they will send you anywhere else and do anything but help you.

The planes themselves are really uncomfortable. It was terribly hot both ways — sweating against my neck rest and unable to sleep hot. The TV’s across our entire section were glitched, and even after a reset, you had to spend the next 7 hours refreshing the movie every 3 minutes since it defaulted back to the Home Screen.

Several times, I clicked the button for assistance. Just water, all I wanted was water!!! All times, no assistant came; the blue light stayed that way for over half an hour and was automatically turned off after being ignored by staff.

Terrible airline run by terrible people who don’t want to be there and don’t want you to be there. Please save yourself the stress, it’s not worth whatever money you think you’ll save since if something goes wrong you eat the cost and pay extra.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahkQ5835GS,Hannah K wrote a review Feb 2022,Hannah K,,3 contributions,3 helpful votes,New York City - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r829511888-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Wretched and incompetent,Date of travel: February 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The customer service is nonexistant. The employees are ignorant - they don't know the rules to fly into the US for Americans, they only know for non-Americans. I had several employees either yell at me, walk away from me while I was talking, or ignore me altogether. Also, if you book, their website says they offer refunds, but this is not true. I wanted my money back after they shut down the borders to artificially raise ticket prices (the government owns the airline and the ""special flights"" skyrocketed to costs over thousands of dollars). I asked for an employees name so I could speak with a manager and they refused to give it to me and then screamed at me. I will never fly with this airline again.

I booked a family holiday to Casablanca for Christmas break 2021. Flights were booked in October 2021 but in the last week of November they cancelled our flights stating borders are shut during that time. This was before the Omicrom outbreak. I received a refund after 4 weeks of constant emails but they deducted £85 for no reason. I have made numerous attempts to talk to them and sent countless emails to explain why have they deducted this amount but no one ever got back to me.

I have not used this airline in the last 30 years due to bad experience with them. As I had an emergency in Morocco and Royal Air Maroc was the only airline taking bookings to Morocco for January 2022 I had no choice but to book a flight to Agadir with them. The border in Morocco was closed again and the airline cancelled my flights and immediately filled a request form for requesting a full refund. few days later I rang the so called customer service for an update on time scale for the refund to be actioned but couldn’t get through to them. After numerous attempts I got hold of someone who was polite enough but has no idea when I will be receiving my refund.   The attitude of this airline towards its customers never seems amaze me.

"I couldn’t find any suitable Air Canada, Air France or TAP so I booked in Royal Air Maroc despite reading horrible reviews. Because of the Omicron, a day before departure they cancelled the flight and put a note in their website about full refund.

I called their call centre like 1000 times. The stupid background music of IVR was so irritating. Without it, at least I could properly hear the voice of the Robot who keeps repeating useless information. Filled out forms twice. Luckily got a hold of a customer service agent and he advised everything in order and call them back after 3 days. Today is the 5th day while I am writing this review. Reading about other people experience I already gave up hope to get my money back.

This Airline and it’s operation is a reflection in the whole Moroccan corrupt authorities and their standard of service. I would advise others, NEVER EVER use this airlines for any reason. They are complete CHEAT and they don’t really care much about it.

"My husband and I planned a trip to Morocco for Christmas Break and bought our original tickets through RAM. About a week after booking our tickets, RAM cancelled our flight. They did not have any other flights that worked with our schedule, so we went online and completed the form for a refund.

We waited an entire month for the refund, but the money was never returned to our account. I called during my lunch break one day, and the woman on the phone told me that our refund request had never been processed. My husband immediately completed the form again. It's been two weeks, and we still have not received a refund.

"Pure, literal hell. Unlike anything I've experienced before. Makes subsaharan African airlines look like Virgin Atlantic.

My itinerary was Barcelona -> Casablanca -> JFK. The flight itself was like a Marrakesh gypsy market. Seemingly unattended children coughing, crying and sneezing for 8 hours. Absolutely no masks worn and 0 enforcement attempts. The whole plane is a Covid superspreader event. Seats so small you couldn't stand up unless someone else did on either side of you. If the person in front of you leans back in their chair, your tray essentially collapses so you better not be eating at the time. Sound does not work on the entertainment system. No alcohol served, obviously. Terrible food. Rude/confused staff that throw things at you, like broken headphones, when you're sleeping. Limited ability for the crew to communicate in Spanish, English or French. The layover in Casablanca was supposed to be 50 minutes but was more like 15 so crazy running through the gates and then 3 rounds of security (the security being a teenager lazily unzipping your bag). Untrained pilot guaranteed a turbulent landing that sounded like we crashed into the ground.

Maybe this flight was a parody, a social experiment for how much abuse people are willing to take to save $300 on a Transatlantic flight. Never again. Do not punish yourself like this.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreyG1212,Andrey wrote a review Nov 2021,Andrey,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Barcelona - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r820464013-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Royal Air Morac is a descent into hell.,Date of travel: November 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight with Air Royal Maroc was quite good.  the least experience is i don't understand why this airlines don't have website check in service :(.  long tima ago i had to wait in line to check my baggageMy Flight was from Rome (Fiumicino Airport) to Maroc (Casablanca) then Praia, Kap Verde (Nelson Mandela Airport).I tried to check in online but it didnt work, i was so confused. Then when we arrived at Fiumicino Airport, we founs out that they only have 3 counters for Royal Air Maroc,When we arrived in the counter, there are lot of african people already waiting and put all their baggages in line in front of the counter.  it was abit horrible because we need 1,5 hour standing there until we get check in!! because most of african people checked their baggage with 60+ kg! it was really horrible! i don't understand what they bring to their hometown, but i think they are all sellers and they bring a lot of products from europe to their hometown and sell it there. we didnt have another choice  so we had to wait in line, finally we got our boarding pass then went to the gate, the airport itself (Fiumicino Airport) was really comfortable, after stood so long i found the laying chair and it was so comfortable.we entered the plane on schedule, so everything is fine! we got our meals which i didnt expect it! that was the nice part. we got our meals when we flew to Maroc and to Praia. it was good!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/f6/23/29/annisap26.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michamong,michamong wrote a review Nov 2021,michamong,"Berlin, Germany",207 contributions,34 helpful votes,Rome - Praia,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r820313480-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Quite Impressive but really long checked in,Date of travel: November 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I chose to fly Air Maroc to Morocco because it is the only airline that flies direct from the United States to Morocco. This is to avoid having to deal with the covid requirements of a transit country. I had a business class ticket, but the check-in was so incompetently handled that it took much longer than economy passengers to complete the process. The staff was unfriendly on top of being incompetent. There was hardly any service on board. You basically pay for the flat-bed seat, but the food and service were similar to economy class. There was no menu for the meals, no drinks when you board (not even similes), no blanket unless you demand it. The seat belt sign was on during the entire flight even though there was no turbulence, and as such everyone was told to never use the toilet. It was the most unpleasant flight, not because of weather or any unforeseen circumstances. Just terrible, unprofessional service. I think this airline has some kind of monopoly on the air routes to Morocco and hence they don't care.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodgenes5,goodgenes5 wrote a review Nov 2021,goodgenes5,"Chicago, Illinois",279 contributions,154 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r819302284-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,One of the worst airlines,Date of travel: November 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After the COVID lock down ceased in 2020, I bought a ticket from Nigeria to Manchester, to attend my grandma's funeral. My flight was initially changed, which is normal, considering all that was happening, but later on I received an email that the my flight had been cancelled by air maroc.
I didn't have an issue with this, I rang several times to reschedule, but was told they had no flights. It took almost two months of calls, before I was given a voucher (EMD-1479800289386), but as I was supposed to be attending my grandma's funeral, I needed to travel to Manchester immediately. I refused the voucher requesting for a refund to allow me purchase from another airline, so I can attend her funeral. I sent the funeral date and scheduled arrangement via their website portal, including the funeral date which was scheduled for January 2021. i also rang them, but the advisers I spoke with were all very unhelpful.

"I’ve had so many bad experiences with this airline in the past - the biggest one being having something stolen from my checked bag. But this definitely beat that.

I am a US Citizen and have had to fly during COVID internationally several times this year and I echo what others have posted here - the check in staff make up the rules and are completely uneducated on the entry laws for the US. They too almost didn’t let me board my flight because they refused to call the Moroccan doctor who signed and conducted my antigen test. It was literally a local number, they just refused to continue to speak to me when I asked why.

When I did eventually get myself onto the flight, I’d say about only 1/3 wore their masks consistently on the flight regardless of whether we were eating or drinking and the rude staff never said a word. There was no respect for physical distance and I even had my head slapped as a woman walked by the aisle while I was sleeping.

"I was traveling back from Morocco to the U.S. I researched all the U.S. entry requirements well in advanced and had gotten a U.S. FDA authorized antigen self kit test with a telehealth representative to verify the testing results. This is accepted under the CDC website to re-enter to the U.S. I bought this test for $35 since I had researched in advance that a test in Morocco costs $70-$120.

When checking in we were refused to check in because they said the U.S. did not accept this test. I tried to show them the U.S. CDC said it’s aceepted but they refused to look. They said the U.S. only accepts PCRs not antigens (I called the airline once back in the U.S. and they told me the airline accepts antigen and PCR for the U.S.).

The thing is, a couple in front of us with the exact same test were accepted… they were in a different line than us and heard our conversation and told us they had the same test. When I told the staff this they denied it… so we almost missed our fight and had to pay $180 to take a taxi and go take a test outside the airport. Both the check-in clerk and manager need to educate themselves with the U.S. covid entry requirements. They were liars and said only PCRs are accepted and denied accepting the same test from a couple on the same fight as us even though that couple showed us their tests which were made by NAVICA and emed lab results.

I will never be traveling with them again. I’d rather pay a premium fee than travel with them. Also, their planes are the most old and dirtiest planes I have ever ridden on. If you wipe the seat, you will see a thick layer of dirt. The only reason I used this airline is because my flight with British airways was cancelled.

Just got stuck  at the ORLY AIRPORT. These people do not even care if you make it on a flight. Provide false information and do not provide any respect to people who are trying to get to United States. They do not offer any suggestions that’ll lead you where you need to be. The blonde lady who is kind of chubby told me go get a antigen test then I came back I needed a pcr test wasted 1 hour missed my flight baggage check in. Could’ve squeezed me in but they didn’t because it’s already hit the time. I was misinformed which forced me to miss my flight. She didn’t offer me any help to get some money off my pcr test for misinformation.  I’ve been vaccinated and have my U.S.A. vaccination card I took the pcr  test in England on Thursday.

When my husband tried to extend the ticket so i could stay longer we were told the return flight was canceled because I didn't travel on the flight going to morocco which was untrue.

The lady she spoke to my husband to had rectified the error and then when he was  asked to extend the ticket again he was shut down by being told I don't have the power to change the ticket and that I needed to write an email to RAM.

"For a company in the service industry, they have NO IDEA what service is. Awful customer service and agents! Every time I call, the agents are rude and speak over me. Also, they hang up when they are done talking, often in the middle of the conversation. The claims filed online get no responses. My issue of refund/voucher has been ongoing for 2 months now. I've been told to call 48 hours later, just to hear that it hasn't been resolved and to call back in 48 hours. What a joke! I hope the pandemic puts Royal Air Maroc out of business.

"I chose RAM to relocate from Morocco to France due to it having a direct, short flight from Casablanca to Bordeaux. I cancelled my previous AirFrance booking that did not have the direct flight and would have necessitated three hours to Paris, a 2.5 hour layover in the airport, and a 1.5 hour flight down to Bordeaux. During pandemic-travel, I chose the shorter route. Due to relocating and having two large and heavy suitcases, I chose to pay for business class for the baggage allowance. Being the ""national airline"" of a country where I had lived for two years, I wanted to show some support.

The flight : standard flight. Business class attendants were ""busy"" and really didn't want to be bothered with their passengers past the point of absolute necessity. Yes, it was a short flight and they had food to serve the few business class passengers, and covid forms to give out. Food offering was surprising since it was a short flight of just under two hours, but quality was ""I guess something is better than nothing, since I'm hungry"".

But to put it succintly...never again, RAM. Even if I have to choose between a short, direct flight and one with another airline that necessitates a longer flight and layover? I'll take the layover -- travel is stressful enough in these days, but after using various airlines and modes of transportation and companies for nearly 60 years, this was not one I ever want to repeat and was a very poor choice on my part.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhisperingRoads,Every Road Whispers wrote a review Sep 2021,Every Road Whispers,France,4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Casablanca - Bordeaux,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r809535507-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Never Again,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This airline is a scam. They lie at every juncture and act as if passengers are the ones creating issues in the “system” . Every agent at check in says a different thing. We boarded a round trip flight from WAS to Accra . After buying tickets for $1200 + . We have been charged a total of $1000 for our bags which the agent on the phone and at jfk told us was part of the fare .

The sheer nonchalance with which they dealt with us is appalling and the ticketing agent INTENTIONALLY checked us into different seats so we couldn’t sit together.

After she had charged us another $400 for our bags, the agent (supervisor ) was very rude and made snide comments in the local language (twi) at the airport in Accra. Just because I had asked her how we were to pay since she had refused to accept the money paid initially because the dollar notes we had presented for their baggage claim scam were no printed in 2020 .

"This was a code share with American Airlines. The seats are pretty cramped together, the food mediocre at best, and the customer service beyond awful. First, they changed our flights which made our connection impossible, then refused to credit the money we paid for better seats to our new flight saying we had to file a form for a refund. Then we paid again for seats and they later changed the aircraft, thereby changing our reserved seats to ones not as good without any notification util we got to the airport. They lost my husbands checked bag and made us go through ridiculous hoops just to file a claim, including sending us to several different people each of whom took forever to write down the simplest information (we even had a photo of it). They were unresponsive to any inquiries, NEVER answer any phone number they give you, and when they did find it 5 days later notified us via email that we would have to pick it up in Casablanca even though we were traveling to other areas of the country. They refused to send it ahead so we could get it at our next stop, or get it a few days late in Marrakech. Fortunately, we were finishing our tour back in Casablanca to fly on to our next country, but what if that wasn't the case? They also refused to let the Sofitel hotel pick it up for us (they also called multiple times to no avail) insisting my husband had to do it in person.

"Our American Airlines itinerary from the US to Barcelona got destroyed due to weather in Miami, so AA rebooked us on Royal Air Maroc from JFK to Casablanca to BCN. Fortunately, we were in business class, so when we arrived at JFK we were able to check in with zero wait at the priority line, which was good, because the economy line was INSANE. The boarding process was a bit chaotic, but once we were onboard, we were delighted by the comfortable flatbed seats and restful design choices. The flight attendants were professional and cordial.

We were on RAM's new 787-9 and the seats were among the most comfortable flat-bed seats we've experienced. Many airlines have no footroom when you recline the seat into a bed--it's like sleeping with your feet in a bucket--but RAM's 787-9 gave plenty of room to move your feet and legs. Even better, and more important to me since I tend to run hot, the cabin temperature was reasonable AND there were individual air nozzles that blew cool air. Historically I have found that most non-US airlines keep the cabins warmer than most Americans like, and often don't have personal air vents, so I loved that RAM kept it comfy (and offered nice blankets if you got chilly).

Since the overnight flight is relatively short, I didn't watch any movies, but there was a large selection of TV and films available and the monitors were large and crisp. Dinner was a Moroccan rice dish with chicken that was very good and filling. I don't remember the breakfast, but it was fine.

Unfortunately we missed our connecting flight in Casablanca because a thunderstorm delayed our departure from JFK, so we had about a 6-hour layover. There was a lounge available, but it was somewhat grim, especially downstairs. The upstairs was much better, and the staff up there was friendlier. Downstairs the furniture was all terrible (chic design, unsuitable for human bodies), it was hot, and the staff seemed annoyed that customers existed. The terminal itself was quite nice, with lots of food options, and we passed an hour by getting chair massages.

We'd heard mixed things about connecting through Casablanca, but in our case it was speedy and easy. We had to go through a security checkpoint, but no passport control or customs. Some of the airport staff spoke limited or no English, but fortunately I was able to get by using my college French from 25 years ago.

The flight from CMN to BCN was on a 737 whose interior seemed ancient, but it turns out was only 8 years old. The seats in business were comfortable. There was no entertainment, but it was only a 2-hour flight. Again, the staff was pleasant. Our bags arrived safely in Barcelona.

We would definitely fly RAM again if we could fly business. If you're traveling from the East Coast of the US to Spain, Portugal, or France, a connection in Casablanca actually makes a lot of geographic sense, so consider them next time you're headed to that part of Europe.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/59/d1/05/rugbyshirt.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rugbyshirt,rugbyshirt wrote a review Jul 2021,rugbyshirt,"Durham, North Carolina",87 contributions,33 helpful votes,New York City - Barcelona,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r797310128-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Business class is amazing; Casablanca lounge needs work,Date of travel: June 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First, my wife is disabled, and needed to ""register"" the wheelchair and battery.  However, never had any confirmations that it was accepted, or even allowed.  On the trip going, my JetBlue fligt was delayed 35 minutes.  Since you can't get boarding passes at jet blue, you must recheck in at RAM, this created an extra step at the airport.  When checking in, they said, since we were late to check in (Really, I was on a connecting flight they booked) they gave up our seats.  We were randomly seated apart from each other, and my wife needs little, but some assistance.  Some nice people rearranged themselves to give us seats next to each other, no help from RAM.  Lastly, on way home, I presented my COVID tests as required by USA law, and they looked at it, told me it was not valid because it was 2 hours too early.  However, USA rules stated, that it's not 72 hours but whole days, starting at midnight.  So I was within 14 hours valid.  She actually told me to call the hospital, which by the way was 4 hours away, and tell them to change the time, other words, alter the test.  Wow.  I asked for a supervisor, and she said, she already asked, and I can't go.  I thought she went to get the supervisor, but she did not, she just left.  I found the supervisor, told her, she looked at my test, and said, she never asked me, and that everything was in order.  She did bring me to the next person, and had them check us in with no issues.  She just walked away form us.....and told us to falsify records.

Hands down the worst airline in the world. I would rather spend an extra thousand dollars than ever step foot near this airline ever again. We missed our connecting flight to and from Portugal because they did not give enough boarding time in between flights and one time they shut the gate on us even though we could still see people waiting to board. The worst part was they lost our luggage and I’m convinced they stole it. It took about a hundred phone calls and a letter threatening to sue for them to give us a few bucks that did not cover the cost of our lost luggage. There is no real office and the customer support is horrible. I was hung up on a few times. Truly the worst airline in this planet. You could not pay me to ever fly with them again.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aajewett,Anna wrote a review May 2021,Anna,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,New York City - Lisbon,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r788506883-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst Airline on this Planet,Date of travel: June 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bought 2 tickets to fly in Oct 2020, but due to the pandemic we couldnt fly (and the flights were cancelled), so i called to find out what needed to be done.  Royal Air Maroc told me that as the flights were non refundable, I had to pay a service charge to get a voucher. As the flights were £1000 and service cahrge was £306, I apid. I received a confiramtion email, a receipt and a credit note for the £1009 I'd originally paid for my flights. Then it comes time to rebook, and I call their reservations line and am told that the voucher is not valid, they have no record of it, it's impossible I paid them any money, and I can't use it. And, no, they won't refund the service fee I paid to get the voucher. I offered to send them a copy, buut they refused. I tried calling customer services, but was told I had to fill in an online form, i did, i then receive an email asking me to call, so i do, only to be told it can't be dealt with over the phone, i must email. So i did. And I receive an email reply asking me to call. And yes, you guessed it, when I call they refuse to speak to me telling me I have to email... and round and round it went.

"Sadly Royal Air Maroc has not improved in comfort or efficiency. They have possibly the largest number of ground staff and flight crew of any airline, but quantity does not make for quality. Comfort - lowest rating. Poor comfort and broken seats, broken monitors, no inflight wifi. Inflight meals - nothing would actually be better. (All liquids were dumped at boarding, though we were well inside the airport security and immigration checkpoints. Normally not an issue, except no water was provided onboard.) Efficiency - low.

One day, I did finally receive a response, now more than 8 months after my flight was cancelled. I was finally offered a credit voucher, but when I replied I said I would not accept the voucher, and that such a terrible experience requires an immediate refund.

The ongoing excuse is the delay of releasing the funds is due to COVID restrictions, please be patient. It's been four months, and we are heading into the new year of 2021. They have no sympathy, knowing people have been undergoing financial constraints, yet they have the audacity to keep my funds hostage.
After my ticket was abruptly cancelled, I had to purchase another ticket to the same destinations at a higher cost due to the time constraints for the total amount of $1,865.00. Yet the travel agent and these airlines have no regard for their customers, who work hard to afford such expensive trips to attend to family and medical issues in countries thousands miles apart from the hardship duty station I currently work in, South Sudan. These airlines and travel agent (VAYAMA) are a disgrace and I will not rest until I receive my refund!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamania1,Wadia Mamania wrote a review Dec 2020,Wadia Mamania,"Juba, South Sudan",2 contributions,4 helpful votes,Washington DC - Bamako,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r780289325-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Refund Scam,Date of travel: August 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is the most fraudulent and useless airline I have ever encountered. Will never recommend them to anyone I know. These guys took booking from me in early November to Lagos when they knew they were not allowed into the country since September. As at now they are still advertising flights into Nigeria. When I found out they were not approved to get into Nigeria, I called them to ask why. Very unfortunately for me and I'm sure for many others too, the very insensitive and unprofessional customer service lady who was also a poor liar claimed the airline was not aware of the booking and kept insisting it was not their fault rather I should blame the travelup agency that advertised their flight. Meanwhile prior to noticing they were banned I had contacted them (Royal Air maroc) earlier to shift my flight forward by 2 days cos of the UK Covid-19 Lockdown and they processed it and gave me a new booking, but here this terrible liar of a lady is claiming the company was not aware of my booking. This booking was done about 3 weeks ago and as at now, flight prices have trippled and she is telling me all they can do is to cancel my booking in such a cold and insensitive manner that I felt like cursing her generation. I have never been this angry in my life. The worst is that I just have 4 days to my flight and I'm not sure what to do right now. So I advise you, don't bother with these guys cos they don't have your interest at heart at all. They are all about the money! Very dubious. It was all my fault cos I was advised against using them but I felt it wasn't right to judge people based on hearsay.

"NEVER USE RAM. AVOID AT ALL COST.
I booked a flight with RAM from New York to Casablanca, my flight was canceled, and I was never notified.
I had another connecting flight, I arrived at the airport and I was chocked that there was no flights to Casablanca planned for that day so now I am stranded in NY.
Called customer service which hang up on me twice after putting me on hold for 15 to 20min each time, both times they took my reservation number and said they were verifying the reservation.
when they finally decided to talk to me, they didn’t offer any resolution, didn’t offer any alternative flights, no accommodation, all I got is “well you flight was canceled”.
I was required to bring a covid test that was taken within 72 hours of the flight, because of this sudden cancellation now the test is not valid anymore and I need to take a new one.
of course RAM doesn’t care they got my money now I am on my own and good luck getting anything from them.
Shame on Morocco for running such a scam.
save your money and time, book with a real airline.

"I wanted to make everyone aware of how dodgy Royal Air Moroc are.
I took the below screenshot on the 3rd of September, right before booking my flights. The last sentence (Cash refund is also possible but requires more processing time) lead me to believe that if the flights were cancelled, I am entitled to a cash refund. The flights were cancelled this morning, and all telephone customer services for the company deny cash refund is possible (infact, I was denied to speak with a manager, and there was silence from the handler when telling them my rights), and the only possibility is a refund to gift card to which after 18 months a cash refund is available. The website has since removed this final sentence that I clearly have evidence of below. Illegal? Either way they refuse a cash refund. Thank goodness for credit cards and being able to chargeback.

"Flew from Manchester to Casablanca to Banjul for a family holiday for my 30th, saved up and was so excited when I arrived at Banjul my case wasn’t there, kept going to the offices in Gambia and was advised they would call me when they had my case, 2 weeks with no clothes underwear or swimming costumes, the office in Gambia was terrible not helpful and spoke to me like I was a piece of rubbish, they gave me an email address to email when I was back in England, I got back beginning of March and emailed straight away, I had a few responses but nothing for a while I put this down to covid and understood, when they finally got in touch they offered me 800usd which I accepted, they had me sending release forms, bank details then a letter off my dad who had booked the holiday to say it was my case and that he was happy for me to b reimbursed, I sent everything over and was advised they had received it , since then I haven’t been paid and emailed everyday chasing however just been completely ignored.

I have travel insurance however my case was lost by them and they should pay out. Do not use as customer service is horrendous they don’t care about their customers just making money.

When I was at the Casablanca airport a man left his bag and coat unattended I advised a worker and they told me to leave it there and they will return, I’m sure any baggage that is let unattended is normally a worry but they just wasn’t bothered .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellover2202,Jade waring wrote a review Aug 2020,Jade waring,,1 contribution,,Manchester - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r765813538-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Never use !!!

I'd advise anyone not to purchase any tickets with them as they are scammers. I bought a ticket that was supposed to leave July 29th to Dakar and decided to ask for a refund which was the big headache. They kept telling me it's processing and for some reason a week after they gave me the voucher excuse which I was not falling for than once you call or email the phone line doesn't work nor the email is bounced right. Anyways what I did is contact my bank to dispute it and it work.

"Definitely The CEO of Royal Air Maroc has to take responsibility for this horrible situation of the company. He needs to resign really before this company would go under. I am a Moroccan and I obviously I would want my country's airline company to be the best. But it's unbelievable how worst this company became in the last 4 years. Imagine I was in Cuba last year and I met an a\American couple and when I mentioned I was from Morocco, they told me horror stories about their experience with the company and the service for the only flight they once took with the RAM. It’s very sad when you meet people out the blue and they tell you horror stories about the company.

Lately I took a flight with the RAM and I was charged twice (extra $2000) for the tickets for no error of mine. Still waiting for refund. The company's accounting service is not reachable by phone. You have to make a request and wait. Each time I call I would be told that the request has been sent to financial department and you have to wait. Wait, Wait and Wait... In the meantime, $2000 of my own money is missing from my account just because I decided to fly with the RAM. It's your money that has been taken from your account, but nobody gives a damn. It's horrible and frustrating no follow up no one you can talk to, it may take weeks or months nobody knows, and nobody can take responsibility for their own error.

I would not recommend flying with this company",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elkhalidy1234,Elkhalidy1234 wrote a review Jul 2020,Elkhalidy1234,"Edmonton, Canada",3 contributions,4 helpful votes,Casablanca - Montreal,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r761263424-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Avoid Avoid Avoid,Date of travel: July 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I will make it short. This was the worst travel experience I have ever had:

I was traveling from ""Nador Morocco"" to ""Oslo Norway"" with a flight change in ""Brussels"". Traveled with RAM from Nador to Brussels. Ended up with:

1. RAM was delayed for 6 hours due to lack of capacity (Did not have enough airlines, all planes were on the air)

2. Bad service experience from the airline in terms of info and communication
3. Lost my plane from Brussels to Oslo due to the RAM delay
4. Did not receive any coverage or support from the airline in view of the costs involved in the delay
5. Both I and my insurance company could not get in touch with the airline after that.

If you happen to be one of those people who has been denied a refund by Royal Air Maroc for a cancelled flight then here is something you can try. If you paid for your flight using a VISA then you can claim a Chargeback from your bank. You will need to demostrate that you have requested a refund from the airline and have written proof that they are refusing to pay. If your bank approves the Chargebank then this will appear as a credit on your bank account and a deficit on Royal Air Maroc's bank account !!!!

In March 2020 RAM cancelled my flight for which I had paid Euros 552 and they have refused to refund a single Euro. I have even contacted their CEO and had zero response from him which shows how interested he must be in maintaining his customer base.

"I wrote a review about this airline last week. Bought my ticket with my Chase Miles. Since then, the supervisor of the Chase travel has reached out to them and he was refused refunds as well. I was informed that U.S. Department of Transportation may get involved. Please see U.S. Department of Transportation's policy on cancellation Below. Not sure if it applies to internationals as well.
You can write a complaint to U.S. Department of Transportation. I can't post a link here but you can find the link from Royal Air own website that takes you directly to the form or you could Google ""U.S. Department of Transportation Complaint Form"" and you will see t he link. Good Luck!!

"Stranded on Schiphol airport for 2 days after they canceled our flight.
But they first showed it way 'delayed' for like 10 hours.
They didn't communicate ANYTHING.
Then it was canceled.
Stranded on Schiphol airport for 2 days
They kept promising next flights when we pushed them but always canceled after letting us wait for ages.
Missed all connecting and return flights.
They didn't ever apologise or even get in touch with us.
We had to book all new flights last minute. Expensive!
Lost 4 days of our holiday, including hotel rent, etc.
Damage over 1500 euros and valuable time.

Tried to claim this myself through their website. Called over 10 times. They've been promising to prioritize our refund for over a year.

Disgusting airline. They are straight thieves.

I truly hope they go bankrupt (after paying us back) so a more capable organization can take their place.

"There is no way to contact Royal Air Morocco. We emailed them back in the February to inquire about the COVID-19 situation, we got an automated response that they will get back to us within 60 day. We still have not had a response to that email. Now the phone (1-800-344-6726) doesn't work either. They emailed us on 3/12/20 informing us they have changed our departure dated on their own from 4/14/20 to 4/16/20. Next email from them was on 4/1/20 informing us they have cancelled the flight and they have issued us an ""Airline Credit"" which we do not need since we were going to Morocco for a wedding and we already missed it due to cancellation.  We have no use for ""Airline Credit"". We bought our ticket through ""Chase Points"" from USA. I believe US  policy requires full refund if the airline cancels. I have another reservation for California on 5/10/20 for a graduation Ceremony that was cancelled. I was going there with American Airline and returning with JetBlue. It was able to easily reach out to both airlines and cancel my flight due to graduation cancellation, received  full refund from AA and ""Airline Credit"" from JetBlue.

"I had a flight reservations with Royal Air Maroc March 22- April 1.
On March 7 I received an email from them saying the flights were cancelled. So I called them that same day and was able to talk to somebody, he had told me I was getting a FULL REFUND within two weeks. I gave them a few more weeks thinking they were busy. It’s been almost a month and not heard anything. I emailed them and the email came back saying permanent error. I called them and a recording saying the call cannot be completed. That was the same number I talked through with them. I normally don’t write reviews, but that is not very professional of them. One of the main airlines of Morocco.

I rated them a 1 Star here. They should have an opinion for 0, because I think thats what they deserve for this kind of service.

I would not or can recommend anybody to fly or use them or their services in the future.
I’m sure if it was a US ,European or Asian airlines you’ll be able to communicate with them and take care of this situation.

I would give them a 0-0 star or not even a star. They should be assumed of themselves on handling or ignoring this business.

"My wife had to fly on short notice to visit her father who fell terminally ill... The only available tickets that don't cost a fortune (this happened during the Chritsmas holiday) where with Royal Air Maroc, and having read all the reviews describing how horrible this airline is, I still went ahead and booked because I had no choice. I booked for myself, my wife, a five year old and a 1 year old. The flight from Montreal to Casablanca was not that bad, the flight attendants were all nice and the plane was ok. Then took the next flight to final destination Beirut. There i waited 2 hours for my bags which didn't show up.I made a claim for lost baggage at the airport and gave a phone number and an address. A week and a half later I get a call to go pick the bags from the airport. So, they loose my bags for more than a week, I had to buy baby food, diapers, clothes... AAAAND no compensation AAAAND I have to go pick up the bags. Great.
Vacation over, 10 hours before flight back home, i try online check in... That doesn't work. I google the flight and find that it is cancelled. No one called me, no one notified me, and its almost midnight we were leaving 4 am the next morning and now we are not. Awesome. The next day i call their local office, they tell me I will have to take another flight 3 days later and offer no explanation to why the flight was cancelled, They just ""don't know"". I waited a couple of hours and did not get any confirmation email. I call back and ask for the confirmation. They send it an hour later but its just for me and the wife. I call again and remind them that i have a 5 year old and a one year old. Finally they send those too. 3 days later I go early to the airport because i want this nightmare to end. First in line for check-in and what do you know there is a problem with the kids seats... although i got a confirmation, somehow there is a problem with the kid's seats. Had to stand there for more than an hour for this to get fixed (with a bored 5 year old and a crying 1 year old).

Boarding was painfully slow. No zone method was used so passengers filed on in a random and inefficient boarding process on a single aisle aircraft. The gate agent had to halt boarding as there was a backlog of passengers on the bridge.

"Royal Air Maroc: London to Marrakesh via Casablanca. My worst flight ever. The second was just less than 4 months ago from Miami to Casablanca, with the same problems. First, don’t expect anything from flight and ground crews. They enjoy chatting with each other. All the time. Passengers? Entertainment? Good food, good drinks? Forget it. Second, delays, flight from Casablanca delayed, because we had to wait for other passengers. Hours of waiting. The flight itself took only about 35 minutes. Landing in Marrakesh was late. Third, luggage didn’t arrive. We were assured the company will bring it with the next Royal Air Maroc flight. They did not call. We had to go to the airport as no one picked up the phone. At airport, after hours of waiting. no one able to locate the missing pieces. We called our travel agent, who managed to get someone. Truth luggage on the system but not physically there.
For Miami Casablanca flight the insurance company did its duty. But personal things lost forever. It seems we’re going there again with the same drama. People in Casablanca told us that this happens every day. So avoid flying-overs.
The only thing that was good is that we felt safe and we had some great tea at the airport (fourth, not on board, it was disgusting). Lounge also: food was touched just after using the cellphone.

"We like to go to Gambia after xmas, Since Thomas cook, we found it very hard to get a flight, we had a stop over in Casablanca 4 hrs going and 55 mins returning home, food on both flights both ways and free drinks, all cases were taken care of everything was nice and smooth

Downside, there were no direct flights, we didnt pre book seats as all flights had to be pre booked so was expensive, we took a chance and were seated together

Also took took Aid medicines, glasses, and wrapped christmas presents for the Gambian children, we were charged £136 one way for 23k we took a total of 36kilos of aid and left the case there, that was just 1 way pretty poor i think

The flight itself was great, better if no stop over though, it was also the most we ever paid",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/a3/8c/35/sammysparkle67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammysparkle67,sammysparkle67 wrote a review Jan 2020,sammysparkle67,"London, United Kingdom",54 contributions,35 helpful votes,London - Banjul,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r741471334-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Very impressed with RAM 1st time with them to Gambia,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Despite many of the horrible reviews of this airline, I booked it for our family of four to fly roundtrip from Dulles (Washington) to Casablanca. They offered a direct flight at a reasonable price. I was pleasantly surprised that none of the horror stories I read came true for my family. The flight was on time, staff was courteous, our luggage arrived intact and quickly at our destination, the food was pretty tasty (for airline food), and all went smoothly. Luckily for us, the flight was not full at all so we were able to spread out. Otherwise, the seating would have been pretty cramped. The inflight movies/entertainment were good.

"This has been the worst company I have ever traveled with. I was suppose to stop at Casablanca for a 1.5 hr layover , which turned to 24 hrs. After the flight was canceled last minute without any information given. They were ineffective in communicating the changes and the passengers were left to figure things out themselves. Which was extremely difficult as primary languages spoken at airport were Arabic and French, luckily For many of us , some of the passengers lended themselves as a resource  .

"First of all, I would love to inform everyone who has the brilliant idea of flying with this pseudo airline be aware they don't have customer service, their ground-service in JFK is rude and unprofessional since they are so bad they cannot even look customers in their eyes when they answer questions.
I was denied boarding and my luggage at that point became a ghost, there are 2 desks in JFK and they both had different answers about my bags, one desk said my bags were returned to me (never happened) the other desk found my bags flying to Casablanca, nobody asked me to fill a form for my lost luggage, so you can imagine the nightmare when in Rome my bags where nowhere to be found.
I've called twice customer service in Italy and whoever answered had no clue of what customer service is about,
The first time the agent was rude, not even trying to help to fix my problem, the second time I've called the agent was kind enough to explain to me that their customer service in Italy doesn't handle problems with lost luggage, they gave me the number for bag handling in Casablanca, but no answer.
I've sent several emails and only one single answer is written actually by a human being, all the others just a bunch of automated emails saying always the same thing.
No-one answers my emails anymore, so I'm sure I will never get any money back for my lost luggage because they don't have what it takes to be a respected company.

"The ground staff at check in were very helpful so we thought we were into a good thing, being first timers on Morocco airlines. But, just before take off I watched out the window as baggage handlers must have decided the plane was heavy enough and proceeded to removed our bags from the plane and leave. We got our bags back 2 weeks later!!
The actual flight was full - everyone seemed to have at least 3 pieces of hand luggage so seating took forever. The state of the toilets was absolutely disgusting.
Our trip back to Geneva was even worse when ticketing told us the London staff had used the wrong ticket for the first leg of our trip and our ongoing one had already been used. It took an hour and a half of going through different people, almost having to buy more tickets before someone finally gave in and decided to just fix the problem and get us on the plane.

"So I heard horror stories about this airline after I before I booked! I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival at Dulles. The check in was easy, the baggage allowance was fair and boarding was simple.

The meals weren’t stellar but it worked. Bring some snacks and extra water, if you are particular. The leg room on the flights was comfortable and I’m 5’11. Flight attendants were nice! It was a basic flight, no bells or whistles but got me there safely.. and that’s the most important thing.

No issue with luggage. We stopped in Casablanca for a 13 hour layover. We were offered two meals and a room at a hotel about 20 mins from the airport. We took an air conditioned bus to the hotel, checked in and had more than enough time to explore. Buses took us back to the airport with more than enough time to board the flight.

"What a morning! Let alone that checking-in with RAM is slow going generally, but with extra luggage, you get treated like dirt.

However it would have been better if she stayed at home in bed at all. She was so unfriendly and not helpful at all that I was close at shouting at her. First of all she did not want to accept my extra luggage. Only after making it clear to her that I am fully aware of having to pay for extra luggage and that it is permitted with RAM to bring extra luggage, she made an effort and vaguely directed her finger into the direction where I could pay for my extra luggage.

"This is the second time I have travelled On this airline, the first time the flight was so late leaving That I missed my connecting flight to Benin and was therefore 24 hours late arriving and missed several meetings.
This time I was in transit to Niamey, Niger. Initially booked to go on a flight from Heathrow, which was switched to an earlier flight going from Gatwick at 11am. The layover in Casablanca was to be over six hours, so I booked to go into the lounge for a 3 hour rest. At 9pm the night before, I received a message to say the flight was put back to 2.30pm. Although annoying to get the information late on, my waiting time in Casablanca would be shorter. On arriving at the airport I discovered at check in it had gone back another hour. The person at check on assured me it was on its way so wouldn’t be any later than that. Checking the internet whilst waiting for the flight, I found to my horror that it had gone back another hour and an hour later, a further 10 mins. My layover time had therefore reduced from over 6 hours to just 50 mins. All without any explanation. As it happened it arrived in Casablanca a little early which gave me 1 hour before my onward flight, which should have been relatively comfortable as it’s not a large airport, but getting through security to the transit area was a nightmare and I ended having to run for my flight and was last to get on the bus to the flight.

"It started by our flight being delayed by 3 hours.  After boarding it became apparent that certain people would be given better treatment than others.  As the only Black people on the flight we were ignored even though we paid for priority seating.  Other families were allowed to move up and sat around us.  They were offered water bottles, I had to ask for one for my kids.  Their kids were offered coloring books my kids were completely ignored.

"Travelling to or from Nigeria on air Maroc via Casablanca is a total disaster. The airline has lowered its standards on this route to the lowest it can get. Firstly,there are non existent queues through security for connecting flights. A mass of people competing for space on the floor. Like flocks of sheep..There is hardly any ground personnel to keep order.

They don't stick to the original gate shown most of the time. So passengers have to florick about up and down like yoyos.

Next, You are more likely to miss your luggage than not.My entire luggage of 9 pieces was missing and it took a week to find it. Around a quarter of the passengers were queuing up with me to report missing luggage. The ground staff in Lagos has bad customer service but mostly overwhelmed by angry shouting passages. I learned that the loss of luggage occurs very frequently.I met with passengers who'd lost theirs weeks ago and hadn't had a single phone call. Calling quarter the flight can be a hell of a job when dealing with angry mostly shouting passengers.

Needless to say that alot Nigerians flying this route have displayed a lack of decorum,rowdiness and loudness that leaves alot to be desired. They attempt to smuggle in extra luggage and scramble for overhead luggage storage. They are loud and largely inconsiderate to those next to them. The airline has followed suit and been unable to enforce discipline and become even more shambolic than the Nigerians. If you can't beat them join them.

My four small children and I Missed my return flight today at 6.35am because the flight was overbooked. The simple reason given at the ticketing desk. They had to use my phone to ring the airline to get this information. My airtime finished so a well wishers offered their phone. Are there no calling facilities at Murtala Mohammed Airport?They cancelled the flight and sold off our tickets, presumably at a higher price, my agent told me. No warning to me the passenger. I had woken my children at 1.30am to get them ready and had to turn them back all sleepy after spending hours on the airport floor. I will be surprised to hear of a personal apology from the airline.

"I would not recommend this airline to anyone even if they were giving out free tickets. From the start of my journey the plane was delayed due to technical problems therefore I was unable to get the connecting flight at Casablanca, leading to further delays. Eventually, we boarded a plane that was unable to take off due to technical issues again. Then we had get to off the plane and wait in the airport with no one informing us of what was happening or when we will be leaving. Eventual we boarded an aircraft and waited a little while then eventually we took off. I ended up getting to Banjul 3 hours late. On my return trip 05/01/2020, once again delays so ended up arriving back 2 hours late.

Some of the staff at boarding gate in Casablanca were extremely rude and conveniently or more so ignorantly did not understand English when it suited them. I was booked requiring special assistance (due to mobility issues) which they ignored and told me to stand and wait whilst they began boarding other people.

My journey back and forth involved four different aeroplanes with the exact same meal on each, with the only difference of the third one being dry (almost burnt). Fair enough although one of the air host told me on the last plane that I had to take what I had ordered (which I refused) a nicer air host came back and offered an alternative which was awful too.

"The check in staff at the Casablanca airport for the Royal Air Maroc that was checking in my wife and I and another family couple was the most arrogant, the rudest, and the least accommodating that I have experienced in all my decades of air travel.  I happened to have a horseback ridding accident the day before flying, and had to go through multiple X-ray sessions at the local hospital to establish if I were fit to travel at all.  It was decided that while I was unable to walk, I could travel with assistance.  I called in the airlines to request special assistance from them, and I was told that I did not plan accordingly, as as per the airlines rules special assistance can be only arranged by phone or web if the request it at least 48 hours earlier, but that could request it personally at the time of the boarding.  That was clear and understood, rules and rules and the timing of the accident sucked.  We went to the airport the following day, I was helped inside by a very nice Egyptian Air helper with a wheel chair (totally random), as the Air Maroc would not provide me a wheelchair until I was pass the security and at the check in desk (I was unable to walk at all at the time).  While at the check-in I asked a female check-in clerk about the Special Assistance, and was told that it was not available as I should have requested it at least 48 hours prior.  I explained that I was involved in an accident that past day I could not possibly foresee ahead of time.  A male supervisor was brought in, and he started off immediately very rudely and arrogantly, without any motion whatsoever to even pretend to try to be helpful, asking me what I wanted.  I repeated again, that I was involved in an accident, rendering me unable to walk and with terrible back pain, and could I please be assisted in any way.  He started yelling that extra seat I would have to pay for, that it had to be arranged 48 hrs prior, and I finally realized he was suggesting that I was pretending to be in pain to gain extra leg room or a better seat.  I offered him my 4 sets of xrays from the day before, but that did not help.  I offered to pay for an extra seat, to pay for an upgrade to the business or first class, or at least for a seat where I could keep my legs elevated, but he at the top of his lungs just yelled “GET THE F...K OUT’ and stormed away.  All 4 of us were left with our jaws hanging low..... The female clerk just left us as well, and we were left by the check in counter being ignored for almost half hour.  No one would speak to us, we were getting desperate and terrified.  Finally another female clerk came, possibly senior, but acting as hostile and unfriendly, with a doctor and two nurses in tow.  She accused me flat out about lying and playing the system to get better seats.  I said I was more than happy to pay for an extra seat or for an upgrade to the first class, yet I was told I could only do it at a airline agency!  I asked why the doctor was there, and the clerk said he was there to decide.  I kept asking for a cleared explanation but with a smirk on her face she just ignored me.  The doctor, French speaking, and obviously educated and well mannered asked me about the circumstances, and diagnoses, xrays, which I provided him, he asked me to stand, and checked if I was able to move my legs, and then very nicely and politely said he was sorry about my accident, and he spoke briefly to the clerk, and wrote a note and handed it to me, and since that stage the attitude of the clerk has totally changed.  She still remained unhelpful and in no way even considering allowing me to either buy an extra seat or upgrade to first class, but she changed our seats she said to allow me to have my legs straight out.  She also apologized for the supervisor’s “get the f...k Out” comment, admitting he should not have said so... After boarding the plane I was wheeled inside only to find someone else sitting in the seat assigned to me, and the airline attendant telling me that I could not be seated in these seats anyhow, because they were exit row.... We eventually had been shown the second to last row, at the very end of the plane, and I endured the most unpleasant flight of the hundreds I had taken so far.  That said it was not the flight, but the check-in experience, the humiliation, the fright at not being allowed out of the country and back home, the feeling of being hated and shown hate.

"Nice and efficient service from NY JFK direct to Cassablanca on a new Dreamliner -- but it went all downhill after that! The domestic side of Cassablanca airport is absolutely DREADFUL. It is like a small, regional bus station with absolutely no amenities. The toilets barely function and there was one small coffee stand. The place reeked of stale smoke though there are plenty of No Smoking signs. There were inadequate chairs for everyone and a general air of desperation and resignation hung over the entire place. To cut a 9 hour story short, our flight was cancelled but our bags mysteriously made it to Marrakech! We spent 6 hours in the airport standing in lines and pleading for information. The airline and its staff failed abysmally to communicate to passengers, protect their staff or manage the situation. At one point, some of the passengers became so incensed that RAM counter staff actually shut down their computers, picked up their belongings and marched off the job! I felt badly for everyone. But honestly -- how can you even take an airline seriously when they announce your flight's departure time as ""??????? 20:45"". I'm not kidding! There was a total lack of respect for staff or passengers and we really could have used someone with authority to organize lines and get answers to questions. Eventually we were placed on a bus at 2:15AM and driven down to Marrakech. We arrived shortly after 5AM. Upon arrival, even though we could see our bags, we were unable to claim them (even with our claim checks) until we'd found someone more senior and dragged him over to Baggage Claim. People woke up, straightened up, saluted each other and we were reunited with our luggage. Fortunately our return trip was uneventful, but RAM desperately needs to upgrade the domestic side of the Cassablanca airport and provide better support and management for its staff and passengers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W577OKcarolynm,Carolyn M wrote a review Jan 2020,Carolyn M,,4 contributions,1 helpful vote,New York City - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r737570343-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Good International Service; Appalling Domestic Service,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've been on a big heap of bad airlines. But by far, the worst airline I've ever flown on is Royal Air Maroc. This airline is so bad, it tops WOW air (that airline that went bankrupt a while back). The customer service was far from good. The staff were rude, unsystematic, and put themselves over their customers.      When my vacation to Egypt came to an end, I got a big surprise at the Cairo airport. Some idiot thought it was a good idea to overbook the flight. So now the staff began kicking people off the flight. THANK GOD I wasn't one of the people who were thrown off.      But that's just the beginning. On the flight to Casablanca where our layover was, the toilet backed up and was closed. So then there was a giant line waiting in front of the one remaining bathroom. The dinner that was served on the plane was mediocre at best. And let's not forget about the obscene sanitary conditions of the plane.     Once we got to Casablanca, we left the plane via stair truck and were packed like sardines into a waiting bus. Once the bus was full, I expected us to leave shortly after. But we sat there for a good 10 minutes before leaving.     The flight back to my home, New York, was about as good as the first. Except I slept most of the time because I was exhausted.      Overall, I would NOT recommend this airline.

First time I ever purchase flight without reading reviews. I almost passed out when I read about lost luggage afterwards. Due to all the bad reviews I told my husband we needed to squeeze 2 week stay in carryons. He said it would be impossible and he was definitely right. We had no other option to check in only one luggage with stuff that was less important to us. We took 1 carryon each and checked in 1 luggage. Must clarify our flight was MIA -> CMN -> AGP 12/22/19 AGP -> CMN -> MIA 1/3/20. I couldn’t risk loosing luggage. Thankfully our luggage made it to Casablanca and back to Miami perfectly.. I did questioned why so many people had luggage issues and it made perfect sense that connecting airplanes are so small that some passengers luggage is so heavy they have no other option to leave behind. To the ones that are missing luggage’s I would recommend calling airport directly since I saw tons of luggage’s on the side ( A huge amount ) With that said I would definitely fly airline again and pack light just like we did.  Btw. Preorder your food before leaving by calling airline directly..

"Only flew with RAM once from Brussels to Dakhla and back. I didn't need customer service (which by the looks of it was a good thing) except to get my miles accredited to my frequent flyer account, which they did within a week.
The flight itself was eventless, legg-room is OK (for a 737), meal is included (which these days is starting to become an exception within Europe). The food itself was OK, nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing too bad either.
The terminal for the local flights in Casablanca must be one of the smallest I've ever seen with barely a place to sit, so luckily it was a short layover (the international terminal you access on the way back does has all the bells and whistles you can expect from a modern terminal).
If you're a kiter on your way to Dakhla, you're also in luck as you can take your kite equipment with you for free, as long as it's below 23kg (so you get a checked luggage of max 23kg AND a kite bag of max 23kg included in the standard fare).
With the experience I had, I would consider flying them again.

One tip: if you want in-flight entertainment, make sure you install the SkyRAM player before your flight, there's no other way to access the in-flight entertainment on their Boeing 737's.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backxb,Ben B wrote a review Jan 2020,Ben B,"Ghent, Belgium",41 contributions,50 helpful votes,Brussels - Dakhla,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r736570288-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,OK flight - transport of your kite-gear for free,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is the worst airline I have ever taken. The staff are extremely rude, unhelpful and incompetent.

They made me miss my connecting flight to London Gatwick from Lagos Nigeria because one of the incompetent staff member placed me in the wrong queue when it was time to board my final flight.

When looking for help, they were completely and utterly useless. I literally went around the whole bloody airport seeking for help because none of the staff could provide any real proper help. When I explained my situation, all they told me to do is wait and they will come and see me. Guess what? I waited for such a long time and nobody attended to me.

I got fed up of waiting for these idiots to attend to me so I chased after several staff workers and demanded for help, until I was then told I had to go the RAM agency. I was told that if I go there I will NOT have to pay for a boarding pass, guess what? When I got there, the cheeky lady had the nerve to tell me to pay for another boarding pass. Lol! You seriously want me to pay for a boarding pass? I explained to her that I will not pay for a boarding pass because this was not my fault. She then said I need to speak to the supervisor and that they don't deal with these kind of problems.

And as you can guess, locating the supervisor was a nightmare as nobody knew where he was. I asked the guys at the check-in point, who were to busy playing on there phones to call their supervisor and apparently NOBODY was able to do this because they didn't have the facilities to do so. So then again, I had to chase several staff members to locate their supervisor so I could get the heck home.

Finally, I managed to chase a guy who was like a supervisor and he managed to get me onto another flight to London Heathrow.

Oh! It doesn't end there! When I got Heathrow to get my luggage, SURPRISE SURPRISE, my luggage wasn't even there. In fact it hadn't even left Casablanca at all, despite them telling me that my luggage WILL arrive at Heathrow. Eventually, my luggage arrived 2 days later at my home address.

I should of listened to the reviews I read online because I wouldn't have gone through so much stress. This is the WORST experience I have ever faced with an airline and I will NOT be using this ROYAL AIR MAROC ever again. My advice to anyone reading this is to only stick to UK based airlines because I know the customer service and staff will be A LOT better.

"I think the reviews overall speak for themselves. Stay away from flying with them. They don’t know the concept of costumer service. They will yell at you, ignore you and not care about you at all.

Flight MIA-CMN got delayed for 2 hours. When arriving to CMN, got informed there were no more flights to Porto. The next one would be in 30h from the moment I arrived. From there everything went downhill. They lied about me being able to pick a hotel to stay the night, they asked me to walk 25mnt to the nearest hotel with my bags, they didn’t provide any compensation, and I felt very unsafe at the airport.

The next day they put in a bus without AC for over 30mnt before driving us to the airplane.

I asked for a refund as I was entitled through my fares policy, as well as the cancellation of my outbound flight and no one ever answered my emails until after the flight happened. I called more than 10 times, answer was always the same, your claim is still processing.

"Did not deliver our checked in luggage. No correspondence or airline staff to communicate with/ provide an explanation.
Flight 1: no temperature control, no blankets, poorly cooked chicken, stale bread and one drink.
Flight 2: No entertainment system aka NO TVs for a flight almost 5 hours.

Staff members practically tackled and bullied passengers at the door of the plane to check in their hand luggage. Yet on arrival over half the passengers' luggage had not arrived and is tracking to ""Morocco"". No one was informed of this prior or after - the conveyor belt just stopped and airport personnel informed us that was all the bags the airline had sent.

A truly and honestly horrible experience.

That is clearly not an isolated incident as people from flights days prior were coming to the airport daily in hopes of retrieving their bags.

In my honest opinion, a dreadful, barely legal, incompetent airline staffed with rude, deceptive, incompetent personnel. I can't prove that this despicable treatment is in part related to the fact the majority of the passengers were Black Africans, but it is very strong impression.

To date, I still don't know how I'll get 8 of my 23kg checked in bags back, and the airline has been nothing but obstructive.

I cant stress enough - that you should avoid this airline. It is not worth the money, the positive reviews are misleading. I write because I wish I had known before booking. A lot of things can be forgiven for a cheap flight (bad food, rude staff, bad temperature control, no entertainment) but I ask you, can you sustain your trip without any of your luggage?

"If you are checking in with Royal Air Maroc- get there very early- the lines tend to be extremely long but they progress at a reasonable pace.

The service onboard was ok- they served two meals on the 7hrs flight and coffee, tea and water were made readily available at your request. However, the wait for the restrooms onboard were interminable as despite the numbers onboard, two of the restrooms were kept locked.

My biggest disappointment with Royal Air Maroc is that they lost a piece of my luggage and 8days later no update has been provided. The representative I filed my claim with assured me I would receive the claim information via email but I have not, and without a claim number you cannot track lost luggage.

At one point, They evens said plane is ready at E7 gate and everyone ( full plane) all ran over from e12, only to find out that they are not ready. It is now 2hours later, they changed the story that they don’t know how long it will be.  And they are waiting on air traffic control to allow them to move the plane from gate E12 to E7. Why did they ask us to all walk to E7 then? This is really ridiculous that this occurs this way and that airline lies to us to keep us calm. I hope someone can help with riculuous waste of 200 people time and cost this is costing me with all appointments and reservations.  They are not hold to any standards at all. Reading all of the review recently, The royal air of Morocco should not be allowed to fly in United States. I just found out their on time record is like ~50%. Why doesn’t FAA or Consumer protection agency hold them responsible by discontinue this Airline’s substandard flight services? This airline is corrupted from top to bottom.

"A normal flight is already just bearable, when a problem occurs prepare for the worst travel experience.

I flew from Montreal to Beirut via Casablanca with royal air maroc. After landing in Casablanca I was shoked to learn that me and the 24 other passengers on my flight headed to Beirut were removed from the next flight. We watched with disbelief other people board that plane while we had to go to the counter to get another flight.
This is when our nightmare starts. They put us on a flight that departs in 30 hours. We asked to fly earlier with another airline, but they lied to us and said there are was no place. We had to search online and show them that yes there were flights with Qatar airways and Turkish airlines.
When we called their lie they agreed to put us on Qatar Airways (even though the Turkish one would have been 5 hours shorter trip). However bad relationship between Qatar airways and Royal air maroc (which turned into a fight between the staff of both companies) lead to a long delay and eventually they refused to board us.
We had no alternative but to take the flight that takes off in 30 hours. Those who were lucky enough to have visa or a Canadian passport were able to go to the city for the night. The rest of us were stuck in this terrible airport. The airport ""hotel"" was more like a prison cell, the food stamps they gave us were terrible. I dont have my bags so no fresh cloth or toothbrush.

I am miserable now, and there is still 8 hours to wait. All I want is to leave this airport that I wish I never flew to in the first place.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/76/avatar058.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3336GHpeterm,Peter M wrote a review Dec 2019,Peter M,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Montreal - Beirut,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r733850754-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Avoid at all costs!,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Please, be advised that if you are returning to Nigeria with Royal Air Maroc, the chance that you will have your luggage, after a stressful and less entertaining flight, is 15%. They will put the passengers in a small vessel (airplane) that can only take 15% of the total luggage. They then retain and accumulate luggage in Morocco until they will be adequate in numbers to fill a cargo flight. This may take between 7 to 14 days.  Most worrisome is the fact that nobody will attend to you to give you proper information on the status of your luggage. As a result, you may wander in the airport for more than six days before you receive your luggage. In the middle of it, if you can display a little bit of rascal scenario, then you MAY be lodged in a hotel (Stop Over Hotel). Please note that the mandatory 150 USD need allowance that must be paid to the passenger experiencing a delay in luggage delivery will not be paid as you are on left your own. The antics work so well that they have employed Nigerians in the name of NACHO to scam Nigerian passengers on their behalf ...Members of NACHO will tell you it is a normal occurrence not to see your bags that you can travel to your destinations without your luggage. This is a ridiculous and shameful scenario which  occur day in day out.

"One of the worst airlines in the world. 3rd time In row that we fly with delay from Rabat to London and they are very often delayed. I'm not talking about 5 or 10 min it's often 1h minimum. Which means we get to heathrow terminal 4 late, we queue for at least 2 hours at the immigration and pay the cab extra because he had to wait longer for us, and RAM would not care less.
I'm fed up with this airline, I don't even understand how One world accepted them...I really hope that BA will start operating on Casablanca or Rabat, the only reason why I fly with Royal Air Maroc (RAM) is because there are no alternatives other than Ryan air.

"We had the misfortune to be on the Sunday evening flight from Brazil - Casablanca - Malaga with what, after 40+ years of flying is simply the worst experience ever.  The check in, security, passport control and loading was brilliant, but not because of RAM, rather because the Brazillian government decree senior citizens should have the same priority rights as disabled, families with young children etc.  There it all ended, the plane, a Dreamliner (used them before) was poorly maintained internally in that one of our chosen seats had no recline and the other the seat back entertainment was not loading.  We requested twice that the screen be reset, twice the request was ignored.  On the third request I was told to change seats if I didn't like it!  Eventually, after an hour and it was a midnight take off, drinks trolley came round - I requested a beer, the other of us a glass of wine - the answer?  A snarling water or juice!  Can you believe the attitude, no sorry we haven't got, no smile, just a take it or leave it attitude.  The meal?  Well the chicken fillet broke my plastic knife trying to cut it, the veggies ok, the yogurt the best part.  4 hours into the flight I went to the galley for some juice only to find the only on service attendant asleep in the jockey seat - would he awoken if there was an emergency I wonder?  Never ever in the years of travelling by plane have I encountered such surly, rude, uncaring, uncommunicative and disinterested cabin crew - not just one of them but the whole bunch need to be educated in customer relationships.

"Flew out to Laayoune from Casablanca, and returned to Marrakech, both flights were good, on time, well organised boarding & pleasant cabin attendents. Flew them again later to Amman, & same good service, Aircraft not the most modern (they have Dreamliners on order), but clean & appeared to be well maintained.
Rumour is they will join Oneworld next year, great.

Our first flight from Agadir to Casablanca was late but the steward reassured us we would make the connection flight. After arriving in Casablanca we were laughed at the gate for our second flight and that we should come back tomorrow same time. We went to the desk and they said us the same. Lucky there was another passenger with the same problem that could speak in Arabic and he insisted on a flight today. After arguing and waiting for an hour they booked us a new connection flight to Lyon and then to Brussels. We took this flight but the next layover was (again) only 50 minutes so we ran the lungs out of our body just making it... we arrived 5 hours later in Brussels then expected.

"Ok so... when you are flying to and from Africa in economy, you want to get there on time and in one piece. Thats generally the limit of ones ambition. Most flights to North and West Africa arent that long and a simple economy seat that gets you where you want to go in a reasonable time is altogether fine.

Sadly Royal Air Maroc cant seem to manage this. Notwithstanding that most of the planes themselves are tatty in the extreme (the fleet consists of a a few modern 787s which ARE decent but the bulk of their transport is antiquated 737-800s and AT7s) their notion of timekeeping is relaxed to say the least, and when they do get it wrong their customer service is nothing short of disgraceful.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adamski1818,Adamski1818 wrote a review Nov 2019,Adamski1818,"London, United Kingdom",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Niamey - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r726019472-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Avoid at all costs,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Really what ever I say will never show how bad to feel insecure.
Alternatively security guys were very polite and felt sorry for me but they were not able to help, the trip it self not bad and quality of service is normal.

Complained to the reception but he seems less interested. Came back home to the UK and claimed compensation which air maroc accepted in Aug and said they will pay between 3 to 6 weeks but till now I have not received a penny. I tried ringing them every week but all they do is lie to you... That they are different to the compensation team and can only teach them by email. And my payment it's on it's way to my account.

"Here is the email I wrote to Royal Air Maroc, which they still have not responded to.

Good Day,

We are writing this letter to share our experience after flying your airline for our Moroccan vacation.

While our stay in Marrakech was wonderful, the journey to get to Morocco was downright terrible from start to finish. Approximately three weeks before our trip, we had received notification that our return flight was cancelled, and rebooked for two days later without any consideration for our input or issues arising from a delayed departure. In the cancellation email, it was clearly stated that it was possible to rebook us on another flight to get to our original destination. Your policy in your legal notice states:

“2.2 Except as otherwise provided for in the Convention, and if a Passenger has a single Contract of Carriage (as defined by Convention) that is the subject of a Reservation: - if the Carrier cancels a flight or - operates a flight with excessive delays compared to the planned schedule or - the Carrier causes the Passenger to miss a connecting flight, or - if the flight does not stop at the Agreed Stopping Place or the point of destination, or - if the Passenger is refused embarkation due to overbooking, The Carrier must, in agreement with the Passenger: (a) Carry the Passenger on the next flight with an available seat, without surcharge and, where applicable, extend the Ticket validity commensurately, or (b) Reroute the Passenger to the destination shown on the Ticket within a reasonable time, in whole or in part on the Carrier´s own flights or those of another Carrier, or by any other means of carriage agreed on with the Passenger. If the fare and charges for the new routing are lower than the refund value of the Ticket, in whole or in part, the difference will be refunded to the Passenger, or (c) Refund the Ticket, in accordance with Article X/2.”

However, when we contacted the customer support center, we were told there were no other options to get back to Boston on our original date. We problem solved on our own to find the solution, and after doing our own due diligence we were able to identify several different options to get us home. After four different phone calls, we were finally able to get home on our specified date, even though the agreed-upon solution was less than ideal. Instead of quick layovers to get us back to boston by 7pm, we were routed through New York, and our scheduled arrival time was after midnight, which interrupted our work schedules (one of us works in finance, and the other two are tenured educators).

Our experience on the plane was poor as well. We had a delayed departure because the crew was waiting for passengers to make their connection to our plane (more on this later). The flight was uncomfortable: the seat did not go back, entertainment system was broken. No actions were taken by flight crew to rectify this.

Regarding the point of delaying the flight: our flight was held in Boston, because the crew waited for others to board the plane from a connecting flight, as stated above. Concerned, we alerted the crew that our connection from CMN to RAK was only 50 minutes, and we could miss it. The cabin crew told us they believed they would hold the plane in Casablanca, as there were a number of us also scheduled to make the same connection. As we deplaned, the cabin crew member confirmed his earlier statement; they were in fact holding the plane. However, this was untrue. When we arrived at the gate, we were told the plane had left and we had to go to the customer service desk to arrange for the next one, leaving in an hour. At the ticket counter, we were told that was not an option, as it was full, and our next options were to take a flight at 10pm (which would have taken away a whole day of plans in Marrakech), or to take a bus, and we had to leave right away. These instructions were given with little to no direction, and we were left wondering:

- Where to find the bus and how we would know it was the right bus for us;

- What time the bus was departing;

- Where the bus would be dropping us off in Marrakech;

- Where to find our checked luggage (This led to additional issues, see below)

A wild goose chase ensued. Luggage was not on the belt, and we were told to go to the baggage counter at belt 5. After waiting for 30-40 minutes to get to the front of the line, the woman at the counter completely brushed us aside and told us to go to the luggage office at belt 1. The woman at belt 1 also quickly and rudely brushed us aside and sent us back to the woman at belt 5. That woman told us to go upstairs and speak to someone in the RAM customer service office outside of the security gate. That man told us that he did not officially work for RAM, but did tell us where to wait for the bus. That was the first time we received concrete factual information. So one person waited for the bus and the other 2 in our party walked in circles through the airport trying to find answers about where our luggage actually was.

After going back through security, we tried to engage with the customer service representative back at belt 1. Again, she was quick to brush us aside, and rudely walked away mid sentence, pretending she could not hear us. It was appalling, and egregious. Customer service like this would get one fired in America. She blatantly ignored us, and we felt hugely insulted during this vulnerable time. We tried to get someone else to help us, and he brought her back to the front of the counter.

She finally took photos of our baggage tags and said her colleague would look for them and they would come out on belt 1. After waiting 20 minutes, bags started to come out. Only one of our 2 bags showed up. We went back to the counter to ask about the remaining lost bag and she said keep waiting. After waiting again, we went up to confirm that it would come, and she said her colleague had sent everything out and I had to go back to belt 5 to the original counter that had sent me to belt 1 to get a claim ticket.

Back at belt 5, the woman refused to provide me with a claim ticket, stating the sticker given to me at check-in back in Boston would be sufficient. As noted on your banner (see attached photo), we are entitled to the claim file reference, baggage recovery guide, and inventory letter. The woman outright told me no and refused to provide me with anything at all. She said I had to complete all of this in Marrakech, which made no sense to me as the bag did not make it onto our connecting flight to Marrakech and we knew that. At this point, we were so frustrated, one of us began to document this problem. Her photo is provided for your reference.

Ultimately, at this point, we wanted to get to Marrakech, so we left without the bag. There were a bus full of people waiting for us in the heat. We knew at this point that this was also a complete waste of time because customer service so far had refused to service us, the customers.

We boarded the bus, which was a fine ride. However, when we booked the ticket, we wanted a flight because one of the people in our party gets carsick, and we also wanted to make the most of our 4.5 day trip and take a short flight. We were supposed to get to Marrakech at 10:40 am and instead we arrived closer to 4pm. It should be noted that according to google search results for “cost of a bus ticket from casablanca to Marrakech” states it should cost approximately. 85dhs. A plane ticket costs approximately 889 dhs according to Google Flights’ search engine. We are due the difference per your policy referenced above.

-The next morning, the member of our party went to the Marrakech airport to see if the baggage ended up there. She almost did not get through security because she did not have the lost baggage claim, but the security guard saw she was in distress and directed her toward the baggage claim office. She waited in line for over 30 minutes and was finally able to file my report. Sure enough, the suitcase was in Casablanca. With driving time, there was approximately an hour and a half lost of the vacation.

That night, she received confirmation that the suitcase arrived and went to the airport to claim it the following morning. This took approximately 1 hour with driving time, as there was no line at the baggage office.

As you can tell per the details of this letter, this was not an enjoyable nor relaxing experience, which we had paid for. We lost more than 8 hours of our time, which we, in our profession bill at an average of $80 per hour. 80 per hour for 8 lost hours for three people would mean a loss of $1,340. While we all love Morocco and can’t wait for our next trip, at this point, we would neither recommend or consider flying Royal Air Maroc going forward without serious hesitation, even though one of us signed up for a Safar flyer membership, anticipating further travel.

We hope you take the time to review the details of this letter and take the proper actions to rectify the situation. We look forward to speaking with a representative of your team. We appreciate all of the hospitality the Moroccan people offered us during the trip, and we hope your airline can do the same.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/31/01/32/lauranoellem.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranoellem,lauranoellem wrote a review Nov 2019,lauranoellem,,6 contributions,7 helpful votes,Boston - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r724726781-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE DELAYS, HOURS WASTED WHILE BEING BELITTLED",Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Update about BOS-CMN flight that was supposed to leave on November 3rd...
20 hours later, there is still no information on when this flight will leave Boston. I called RAM customer service several times (per their request to “check after an hour’”). My last call was at 11:30 am on November 4th and no one has an answer besides “the airplane that’s supposed to leave Casablanca hasn’t left yet and that is the plane that will be used for BOS-CMN flight”.
This is mind blowing! I’ve never experienced this or heard of such a thing before. The ONLY Moroccan airline is struggling to follow the guidelines and operate properly, yet, they get away with this nonsense. RAM employees are condescending and incompetent. They address passengers as if they’re doing the world a favor. They have 0 customer service skills and they are very unprofessional. It also seems that they treat passengers the way their superiors treat them. Passengers are entitled to little to no information and they just have to sit and wait. Even if it means waiting for days. They just don’t care. According to other reviews, this is routine.
My questions now (besides when is this Boston flight going to leave?) are:
1) Why is this airline company still in business?
2) Who trains RAM employees?
3) Is there only one airplane that operates between BOS and CMN?
4) If I want to send a complaint, does it need to be addressed to RAM CEO or the Moroccan Dept. of Transportation?
5) Will my complaint be considered or disregarded? (maybe the latter based on my experience).
This is a serious issue that needs to be handled and if the people in charge have the same attitude as their representatives (across airports), the issue will never be resolved.
RAM is inconveniencing passengers and their families. There are people who need to get to a funeral, to work, school, maybe have a surgery scheduled. Passengers pay for their tickets and they need to receive the services that they paid for, not get treated like a mule.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samya_MR,Samya wrote a review Nov 2019,Samya,,2 contributions,,Boston - Casablanca,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r723808096-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Flight Cancellation w/o Resolution,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight from Boston to Casablanca on November 3, 2019 at 8:20 pm got canceled without advanced noticed. I arrived to the airport 3 hours prior to his flight to find RAM employees that had no information whatsoever about the reason for cancellation or when the next flight will depart. They asked me to try again in the morning. I contacted RAM customer service to find out why they didn’t notify their passengers of this cancellation and to get information about the next flight, but no one seems to have an answer. They asked to try calling again after an hour. It’s been 7 hours now and every time I call the representatives ask to call again after an hour.
RAM hires the most incompetent and unprofessional staff. They could care less how inconvenient or unpleasant the passenger’s experience is and treat people with a high level of disrespect.

"Having flown from Manchester to Gambia (Banjul) via Royal Air Morocco - I cannot exaggerated any more what an awful experience it was. I arrived midnight on the 18th October only to find my baggage was lost. After a frantic few hours I managed to find airport staff who where able to tell me my bag was delayed and would arrive the next day (after midnight on the 19th). I was given a number to call to check.
I called on the 20th after 3am (only to get a rude answer about how the luggage was still missing)....the employee sounded half asleep and could not give me straight answer; apart from try again on the 21st.
So I rang Royal Air Moroc direct. Totally incompetent is all I can say. No sympathy, no help and no way of tracking down my lost luggage. I was told it would be found by the next flight. So yet again on the 22nd I rang Banjul airport - still no sign of luggage and was informed there had been no flights that day (words failed me - so they lied)!!!!

So I rang again after midnight on the 23rd to find out my luggage had arrived and they would not be sending it to my hotel and that I had to come and get it myself (having told me when it first went missing that they would deliver it to my hotel).

NEVER fly with this airline. Another angry passenger told me on the first day of this debacle this this airline does this all the time. They are well known for this. So to avoid what I went through - please avoid flying with them. Not once did they mention compensation. I'm still waiting to hear back on this.

"As I have traveled on other primarily government-owned airlines, LOT and Turkish Air, I thought that Royal Air Maroc was very good. In fact, I was quite skeptical of flying this airlines, it was arranged for me. Royal Air Maroc adhered to the flight schedule, had an endless array of entertainment available (with a seat screen vs. using your own device), accommodated my vegetarian request adequately-- multiple meals, continuous drinks (wine included) and snacks were provided throughout, a small personal convenience package and blanket awaited on each seat, seats were comfortable, boarding process was reasonable and relatively swift, and the plane was so new in design that the windows had a gradient design for adjusting outside light. The bathrooms were the largest I have experienced, aside from Korean Air, really spacious for an airplane...and relatively clean throughout the flight.

"I just flew IAD to CMN then returned RAK to CMN to IAD without any problems or significant criticisms at all.  It was a typical international economy class experience.  RAM staff on the ground and on the plane were organized, professional, and polite.  The boarding process was orderly at each step.  The planes (a 787 for the international leg and a turboprop for the RAK to CMN leg) were clean and functional (including toilets).  The food on the two international legs was unremarkable, but hot and edible.  All flights arrived on time or early (two left late but made up the time in flight).  My luggage made it both to and from Morocco (including the change of planes on the return trip).

"We took this flight as it had shorter duration to fly from Lagos/Nigeria to Lisbon but it turned out to be the worst decision. This airline lost our 2 bags. And also for many passengers. Now we are 3 days in holiday without cloths. This airline will not help you with anything. Their call centers are worst, they will hardly will be willing to help you, they are literally useless. They still can’t trace our bags, what a joke is this. They call themself a big airline but can’t Handel small bags, what a shame. They need to change the way they work and Handel their jobs. It’s the worst airline I have flown in my 22 years of flying. Please take caution before you book a flight with them as you May loose your bags, there are 90% chances. I suggest carry cloths in your handbags as this airline will loose your bags and will not help you at all, as they literally don’t care..... if you want to enjoy a stress free holiday choose another airline even if it takes a longer routes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amarjitbisain,Amarjit Bisain wrote a review Oct 2019,Amarjit Bisain,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Lagos - Lisbon,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r718679815-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst Airline in the world,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Getting from the airport entrance to the gate includes going through multiple inefficient and redundant security and documents checks, which are not under the airline's control. Under the airline's control are:
- Check in: Online or at machine kiosk, where baggage tags are printed out. Tagged bags are then taken to the check-in counter, and the process is fairly efficient.
- Boarding: Terrible. It took nearly an hour to board a 200-seat flight. Boarding zones not observed, no clear line, passengers boarding with multiple carry-ons (only one should be allowed), very slow boarding pass and ID checks.

"Having read the reviews here I went into this flight with pretty low expectations.  I actually bought a new carry on bag that fit their dimensions, packed lighter than I ever had so as not to have to check a bag, and even bought two $60 backup flights from Casablanca to Lisbon on Air Arabia, in case we should miss our outbound connection.Given that the flights were actually pretty pleasant, my expectations were exceeded.  I was on the 737 Dreamliner across the Atlantic and, apart from my seatback screen not working, I would say the flight was similar in service, aircraft, etc. to transatlantic flights I've taken on United or Delta.  Plenty of food, service, etc.  The flight to Lisbon was similar.On the flight back, I will mention that you are not allowed to bring any water onboard the plane when boarding in Casablanca.  So the water they provide on board becomes pretty important.  Be aware that there is plenty of water for you but they don't necessarily come around with it more than once or twice, but it is always available in the galley for you to get yourself and the flight attendants don't object to this.  (Maybe getting the water ourselves was easier for us because we both had aisle seats.)We didn't check any bags on the way out, having read the horror stories, but we did check them on the way back and they both made it to JFK.Given that we paid less than 50% of what United or Delta would have cost, which saved me $2k, I'm happy with our experience.  Now, maybe I was just lucky, and I'm aware that what you really pay for with United or Delta is the support they give you when something goes wrong.  But, with not checking baggage, and with the backup flight on the way out, I felt we were pretty well insured against having our vacation ruined by any shortcomings in RAM's lost luggage or flight rebooking abilities.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/aa/b1/38/bnad.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bnad,Bnad wrote a review Oct 2019,Bnad,"Brooklyn, New York",35 contributions,18 helpful votes,New York City - Lisbon,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r714749195-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Not as bad as I've read here,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently flew on roundtrip flights from JFK to Casablanca. On both flights, there was not a great deal of organization on the ground before departure. You had to guess when boarding would proceed and was not given a great deal of instructions. Whether this was due to the airport or Royal Air Maroc personnel is not known. Nonetheless, the flights were really okay. The airline staff was personable and responded if a problem arose. We had two meals on both flights and they were tasty and a decent size. The bathrooms were kept generally clean with no problems noted. The In-Flight entertainment system was good and provided a great deal of options and choices to view. As usual in economy class, the seats don't provide the most ample amount of legroom. When a passenger in front of you sets the seat back, you feel that you are ready for a lap dance, Nonetheless, I was generally pleased with my two flights on Royal Air Maroc.

"Me and the 3 friends who traveled with me are extremely disappointed with RAM onboard service. We all previously ordered kosher food for our flights Madrid-Casablanca-São Paulo and for the 3 meals we had (1 in the Madrid-Casablanca flight and 2 in the Casablanca-São Paulo flight) we were served exactly the same food, with not one single difference from one to another. Although the first time it was good, to be forced to eat exactly the same food, for 3 times, in less than 15 hours, is something that no PAID service should force a client to experience. Not to mention how un-nice the flight attendants are (in all flights). Are they trained not to smile? They were extremely mechanical, unfriendly and looking like they were being forced to do their jobs and that we should be thankful by the mere fact they were there, going up and down with their frowned faces. Although we saw that some ordinary ""chicken or pasta"" meals were left after everyone was served, they refused to swop the repeated meal we were served. The attitude of the flight attendants were noticed in all our flights, including the Brazil-Spain ones. Finally, although RAM uses a new 787-9 aircraft in the São Paulo-Casablanca-são Paulo routes, the aircrafts they use in the Casablanca-Madrid-Casablanca routes should really be retired. They look old, dirty, poorly kept and unsafe. I have been working in the travel industry for almost 20 years and you can be sure of my experience in the field. For all those reasons, RAM will really be our very last option when we have to choose an airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/f1/ed/37/ofmaduro.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofmaduro,Osmar Maduro wrote a review Sep 2019,Osmar Maduro,"Sao Paulo, SP",4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Sao Paulo - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r714336551-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Poor onboard service and unfriendly staff,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Staff in Casablanca neglected to print out new bag tag for my outbound flight to Cairo, no one picked up my bag and put it onto the next flight during transit in Casablanca. That's my best estimate of what has happened. Terrible and rude desk staff slacking on their jobs!

It's been 11 days and my luggage is still not found. I have a transit in Casablanca to Cairo after the flight with Royal Air Maroc with Egypt Air, so for 11 days I could only deal with the representative of Egypt Air in hopes the airlines would be communicating with each other, little did I know 11 days later that there is zero communication between airlines and the system they have is inefficient to a T. Yesterday I was at the Cairo airport AGAIN to search for my own bag in their storage rooms, it wasn't found. And a new information arised, that the ground staff of Egypt air and royal air Maroc in Casablanca are actually operated by Royal Air Maroc themselves.

The guy who handed me my boarding pass in Casablanca gave me my old bag tag saying this is your bag tag now, and told me that someone would pick up my luggage and send it to the next flight, I asked him about my luggage multiple times and he assured that it will be taken care of. I had 3 hours of transit time, IF I KNEW THE PEOPLE AT AIR MAROC WOULD BE SLACKING LAZY AND NOT DOING THEIR JOB RIGHT I WOULD GO OUT AND PICK IT MYSELF. I don't need you to be losing my luggage and then not responding to ANY of your customer services, I do not need to talk to a bot, I need your support as a human to another human and GO OUT THERE AND LOOK FOR MY BAG, a very high possibility it is now sitting inside your store room ROYAL AIR MAROC!!

I have been traveling in Egypt for 11 days without my luggage, everything inside is precious to me and I won't begin with how much heartache anxiety and stress this has caused me in my travel. Your negligence in caring for your customer, your mistake in losing my luggage, you allowing incapable inefficient people to work at your front desk, has caused me a lot of money and time exhausted on nothing!

"Royal Air Maroc is an airline that lacks customer focus and service. The story is long but here is a snapshot. I booked in to British Airways First Class gates at Heathrow. For whatever reason my bag did not make the flight to Madrid - I was then connecting on Royal Air Maroc to Casablanca. When I arrived there was no bag. After queuing for an hour I was told the bag was in Madrid and would be on the 8pm flight that night and would be delivered to my hotel. I was despatched to another desk and was given a computer print out and was told by the rudest woman in the world the bag would arrive sometime and I would need to collect it. I was travelling around Morocco and leaving Casablanca the next day. In short my bag arrived after I left Casablanca. My tour guide made ~50 phone calls asking for the bag to be sent to either Fes or Marrakech. This didn’t happen! After buying and borrowing clothes I picked up my bag 9 days later at the airport. I encountered the same exceptionally rude woman again. I asked why it wasn’t forwarded as asked. The answer the bag was in Madrid - rubbish I said. Her response was to shrug her shoulders and say email it. I asked to see her supervisor and she said “what is your problem” - my answer Royal Air Maroc and you.

There is lots more detail to the appealing service but I can’t fit in the words.

I strongly recommend everyone avoid Royal Air Maroc - they are HOPELESS",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tassietravellertour,Ross wrote a review Sep 2019,Ross,,1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Madrid - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r712047725-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Royal Air Maroc the worlds worst airline,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Like many others, i ended up having to take this airline because it was the cheapest one available and i was running out of time to book a flight to connect in Casablanca to Valencia. My first flight was delayed nearly 2 hours due to some mechanical problem.  But it was safely fixed and the flight was fine (just some regular turbulence toward the end). They served dinner and breakfast on our flight from Washington and had inflight entertainment available. I had beef and mashed potatoes for dinner and some pastries, a roll, and yogurt for breakfast. I don’t mind airplane food so it was okay to me. They also have the USB chargers available but it should be noted that the one on my seat wasn’t working. Eventually we landed, but unfortunately, we experienced what seems to be a common occurrence on this airline: they left our bags in Casablanca. So on our second flight, we had to fly to Valencia without any of our clothes or toiletries except for whatever we happened to pack in our carryons. We had to end up buying extra things we were missing while in Valencia. In addition, the second flight didn’t have proper A/C and was quite hot to sit in while waiting for departure. Anyways, we had to wait 2 days after we arrived to finally retrieve our luggage from the airport. Luckily, it was shrink wrapped (probably to keep it safe from theft). But dealing with customer service to help us get our stuff back was an absolute hassle. They kept saying they would contact us when the bags arrived but we never heard back from them. We had to just go to airport ourselves to find them. Overall, i absolutely wouldn’t recommend Royal Air Maroc to anyone unless you want to deal with poor customer service and don’t mind retrieving your luggage days after you’ve arrived at your destination. Plan your trip as early as you can so you can invest in an airline that won’t  make the travel experience more difficult than it already is. There’s a lot of extra money we had to spend to fix the inconveniences that Royal Air Maroc caused us and i doubt we’ll ever get any type of reimbursement for any of it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trulyoverit,Mabel M. wrote a review Sep 2019,Mabel M.,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Washington DC - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r710841082-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Should’ve listened to the reviews lol,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On a recent return flight with Royl Air Marroc . . .
Some passengers reclined with shutters pulled down - right through taxi, take-off, and landing. Others were roudy even before the doors closed , but ignored by the plane staff.
The toilets were filthy and the stensch of pee an poo intensified over the 5hours of the flight.
The disinfectant was only sprayed towards the end of the second fligt; even-though a few passengers had forcefull sneeze attacks.
Some of the passengers had to find alternative seats when the cabin crew did not adhere to seat allocation.

On non-lifethreatening issues . . .
Some of us got the 'sock-and mask'-bags, some got blankets, while others used the blankets laying around from previous flights.
The cabin ceiling had spills of something brown, and the seat in front of mine of someting white - and old chewinggum.

"My flight was cancelled, from Gatwick, and departure rerouted from Heathrow. I have call them and ask to have the return flight as well on Heathrow. Guess what? A lady from customer service called Oufa, Ofa Afa, something like that, is telling me that is not posible.
It was useless to have a conversation with jer, as I haven't seen in my whole life such an attitude, not willing to help at all, extremly rude, and saying only that we apologise a lot. What a joke!!!!
I have asked to speak with a manager and guess what? The answer was that is no supervisor speaking English on duty. Another joke, worst than the other one
This woman was just repeating: feel free to call tomorrow to talk with a manager that speaks English, and there is nothing that I can do more.

"My transatlantic flight on Royal Air Maroc was average compared with U.S. and European airlines that I've flown, except for the dirty cabin and absent crew.  The reservation and check-in went smoothly (although leave extra time to go through several security checks at the airport).  Food was good for economy class, even if portions were small.  In-flight entertainment was a limited.  However, the toilets were the dirtiest that I have ever seen on a flight.  I tried several toilets halfway through the flight, and they were all strewn with toilet paper, wet, and somewhat stinky.   In addition, aside from distributing blankets and meals, cabin crew were invisible, and the crew area in the back was a mess.  The flight was inexpensive (especially considering a generous 2-bag allowance in economy), and there are many connections from Casablanca, so if cleanliness is not a priority, Royal Air Maroc is as good as another airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/5c/3d/e9/lily512.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lily512,Lily512 wrote a review Sep 2019,Lily512,"Lexington, Virginia",23 contributions,40 helpful votes,Casablanca - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r709159491-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Inexpensive option but poor service,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I often have to go to Rabat - Morocco as my family leaves there (3 to 4 times/y). Unfortunately there are not many choices from London but travelling with the national company Royal Air Maroc.
- DELAYS
I can’t remember once the Royal Air Maroc has been on time. Every single time I had to travel with the RAM for the past 4 years (around 15 times), the arrival was delayed by approximately 30’ to 2h. This almost looks like a standard for the RAM.
- DISORGANIZED CREW
Secondly, I am always amazed by the lack of organisation of the crew. It looks like they have no clue of what they are doing and prefer doing things free style instead of planning. I have a few exemples. The most recent one is dated from the 10/09/2019 when we have been called for boarding and had to wait 1h standing because the staff didn’t manage to call passengers by groups as they should do.
The Company has to check all passengers bags, this is an obligation from the British law. However, even if the RAM knows this very well, they never plan this way ahead in order to avoid delays. Because the Royal Air Maroc is constantly late, they miss their slot at the security and that ends up to long waiting hours (2h in average).
- SECURITY & UNSKILLED CREW
Thirdly, the crew doesn’t respect the security basics. As soon as they land, people start to stand up and take their luggage while taxi. Adults as well as children are walking in the corridor and the crew is not even there to remain that basic security rule.
- RUDENESS
Overall, they are quite rude and unskilled, there is no excuse when they are late, they give wrong information, they is no smile and they are not helpful.
- AFTER SALES SERVICE
I have reported all those things every single time the Royal Air Maroc asked me to complete the “satisfaction survey”. However, nothing has never changed and the only thing that RAM could tell me was : “it is passengers fault” which gave me a sour laugh.
As a frequent and regular customer, I believe my review is quite accurate and reflect the reality of this company, I definitely recommend you to avoid flying with the Royal Air Maroc.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouDut,LouDut wrote a review Sep 2019,LouDut,"London, United Kingdom",30 contributions,40 helpful votes,London - Rabat,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r708628027-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Avoid the Royal Air Maroc: delays, unskilled & rudeness crew",Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The personnel at Royal Air Maroc at JFK and onboard were extremely pleasant and easy to deal with. They actually believe in sorting out problems the best they can, instead of treating passengers as nuisances, as has sometimes been my experience with other airlines. The seats are as comfortable as any these days, but the food is definitely better than what I've had with other airlines flying between the U.S. and European countries, with stops along the way. This time I stayed at a hotel overnight provided by Royal Air Maroc near the airport. it didn't have wi-fi but that's not the end of the world. It was perfectly clean. It had a pool. And free breakfast. I do wish it were easier to find the Accommodations Desk at the airport, since there was no clear indication about where to go at the airport proper, but asking got me there, and one kind person who worked at the airport actually walked me to it. My luggage was waiting for me in Lisbon, and in fact my suitcases were among the very first to come out onto the conveyor belt.

"I have flown numerous airlines: Kenya Air, Kalula Air, Emirates, Delta, JetBlue and a host of other airlines and this is the worst airline ever! In August, my friend and I were scheduled to fly from JFK to Dakar. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 8:55. Our flight left more than 2 hours late. The sad part is, there was no gate agent or anyone else to inform passengers that the flight would be delayed. We only knew the flight was ready for boarding when we saw passengers lining up, again no announcements. I thought it was a fluke until it was time for me to return to the states. The exact same thing happened. We were scheduled to arrive in Casablanca at 11:00 p.m, but did not arrive until 1:00 a.m. Again, no announcements or apology. You only know it is time to board when you see others standing in line. They know when they finally see someone in a Royal Air Marco uniform. When we arrived, the passenger seated next to me was so upset because he had missed his connecting flight. The next flight out for him would be 24 hours later. In addition to being late, they literally destroyed my luggage! What damage they did not do going over, they did on the return flight. At JFK on international flights you have to retrieve your luggage and then recheck it for connecting flights. When I retrieved my luggage I knew It would only be good for storing out of season clothing or the garbage bin. It is in horrible condition. I would advise anyone considering traveling this airline to reconsider your choice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Savannahmom2,Savannahmom2 wrote a review Sep 2019,Savannahmom2,,37 contributions,9 helpful votes,New York City - Dakar,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r707482439-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst Airline Ever!,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I purchased my round trip tickets between New York and Lisbon 4 months prior to my planned trip this October, and out of nowhere, Royal Air Maroc decided to cancel the return flight and placed me on a completely unacceptable date.

I used their WhatsApp chat line, to encounter multiple automated replies by some robot. Through their agents “Gotogate.com” and “Mytrip.com”, the answer is, “please wait for a reply from the airline”!

"Flight gets delayed by 4 hours (and is the case most of the RAM flights) and no communication ahead of time with passengers so that they can make the proper arrangements before heading to the airport.

Seems like the crew is not properly trained/overseen to collect the trash. They don't take proactive measures to collect and minimize trash frequently before landing. Walking out of the airplane following a transatlantic flight feels disgusting... especially when it's supposed to be a relatively new ""Dreamliner"" plane.

"Royal Air Maroc is by far the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. We had four flights with them. All of these flights were delayed by at least 1h 30min, wich lead us to not reaching out connecting flight. The rude and incapable staff were finally able to arrange our onward journey. However they will not look for the quickest way to get you to your final destination, they will just put you on their next flight (which can be a while). This meant we had to spend a night in a horrible Casablanca Airport Hotel. Also they did not release our bags overnight, so we were left only with our hand luggage. The next day we left Casablanca with another delay but finally made it to our final destination.

Also their onboard product is terrible. The food is basically just rice and broccoli and the restrooms are the dirtiest I’ve ever seen on a plane.

The only plus side to Royal Air Maroc are their cheap prices. However tickets are not cheap enough to make up for all the stress a trip with Royal Air Maroc will cause you.

"The flight was ok. Service on board reasonable and we got our luggage without a problem.  My issues started after the flight when I contacted Customer Service about the watch I bought from Sky Shop, their on-board duty free shop.  Bought it end of October, gave it to my daughter for her birthday early January. It didn't work. Had my jeweler check it out and it was faulty.  I contacted the watch company, Hippie Chic, and they directed me back to Royal Air Maroc. I was disappointed that Hippie Chic wouldn't just send a replacement since the watch would be coming back to them either from me or from the airline.  I then contacted RAM via email as instructed on their website.  I received an electronic message stating that I will hear back within 60 days.  Well, that was February and I still haven't heard back from them.  I have written a few times and have called their office in Montreal who have twice told me that they will forward another message to the Customer Service Office.  It is now 8 months later and I have given up.  So, for a $30 watch and what would have taken someone 10 minutes to resolve,  they have lost my future business and are subject to another poor review.  After reading the numerous negative reviews and my own experience with Customer Service, the other negative reviews are warranted. Customer Service emails go into a 'black hole' and are not dealt with.  I know that if I were to fly again with them (which I won't) and something should go wrong I would never get any support from Customer Service.

"This is the most terrible airline I’ve ever flown.

They took off almost 2 hours late for a connecting flight through Morocco to the US. We were rushed through two security checks to make the connecting and then they promptly left all of us.

Staff in the airport was rude! I was trying to explain that my medication was in my luggage and I needed it and didn’t want to die. The desk agent said, “We all go sometime.”

They sent me to two different desks to pick up my luggage to get it, but then wouldn’t allow me to do so. It took me 3 hours of wandering around to get to the desk to get my voucher for a hotel.

The hotel was DISGUSTING. Threadbare towels, dirty room, disgusting buffet of undercooked and unseasoned chicken. Someone else had a key to and entered my room!

I filed my complaint from the hotel on July 7th, was told I’d receive compensation after multiple follow-ups via email, Twitter and calls over the next week.

Still have received nothing 6 weeks later and it appears this happens quite frequently and other folks have been waiting MONTHS. No way this airline should not be heavily fined.

Oh - and my luggage that I hadn’t seen for over 24 hours came off the plane shrink wrapped with my designer bag broken in it.

"This was the worst flight my family and I have ever been on. We have travelled to multiple countries before and have never experienced this in our lives. The plane was disgusting. The bathrooms were so unsanitary that we tried to avoid them for the entire 7 hour flight. The crew rarely came through with trash bag so that the floor was covered in trash. The crew were rude. Half way through the flight the middle section's televisions failed and did not work for the remainder of the flight. Then to make things worse they managed to get three of the four bags to the airport but lost the fourth. Their staff at the airport and on the phone were rude and yelled at my sister when she attempted to get information about her bag.  When I went onto their instagram, all the comments were about lost luggage and awful service.

"I flew more than 150 times all around the World with a lot of airlines but I've never had so many problems as I had with Royal Air Maroc! Apparently there has been a lot of issues with luggages in the past month (according to a Royal Air Maroc employee).

Everything started in Casablanca airport, when we checked 3 luggages. They should told me that they probably wouldn't go with us in the plane and I wouldn't check the luggage and this claim would be avoided. The flight was delayed 2 hours but that was the least of our problems. When we arrived at Ouarzazate airport 0 passengers received the luggage. The cargo was empty! We had to fill the claim at the airport so we had to wait for 3 hours since there was a lot of people in the office. I contacted the airline for at least 20 times and they always said the same thing ""We don't know where your luggage is"". After 3 days without clothes and most important my brother medication (which put his health in serious risk) , the luggage finally arrived. When we saw the luggage it looked like it went to the war in Syria, as it was completely destroyed. The handler was broken in 2 of the luggages and the surface was completely messed up in all of them, with thousands of scratches.

They lost our luggage, ruined our trip to Morocco, put my brother health in risk and returned the luggage destroyed!

They never apologized and they didn't give us a refund. Stay away from this company. Just travel by train or bus. Takes long time but it will take you a lot more with the delays and the trouble this company will cause you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/e4/79/99/diogocanelas.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diogocanelas,diogocanelas wrote a review Aug 2019,diogocanelas,"Sydney, Australia",58 contributions,61 helpful votes,Casablanca - Ouarzazate,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r702341341-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Worst airline in the World!

"I have been traveling on 10.08.19 with Etihad airways from Abu Dhabi to Casablanca and with Royal Air Maroc from Casablanca to Agadir I have bad experiences with the Sattaf and the service of Moroccan airlines starting from Casablanca. The flight was at 11:10 am and one of the group staff informed us that they will be a delay and we accepted, at 11:00 am they have started the boarding under the name of Errachidiya and my friends informed that they hear that the name of Agadir I approached the lady I asked her what time will be the flight as we got it will be delayed, she surprised me that this is the flight going to Agadir. I had informed her that no one say it on the speaker and next to me there was some other clients from usa that they don’t under arabic language I informed them if you are going to agadir this is the flight. Your staff are not professional on the customer service they need more trainings.

When I arrived to agadir my two luggage’s were lost, I’m made the claim and I received my client number on the next day to follow my luggage’s as the poor agent was writing the claim manually.

I called the call center to follow up with my luggage’s they said that they don’t know they do not have any informations and I have to call Etihad Airways.
Etihad had confirmed me that my luggage’s were transferred to Casablanca peacefully. After 2 days I received my by late in the evening and it was damage and just yesterday I received my second bag after 10 days being with out my cloths and my laptop as i have things to do.

When I investigated my second bag was in Marrakech 😮 I don’t know how come that happened than on the 19.08.19 they sent back to Casablanca than on the late evening they sent it to Agadir airport.

This my last time I will travel with this Moroccan airline they still far on handling the customer care and now I would like my full refund of the 10 days delay not receiving my bag on time and also the damage of my bag that I received after 2 days of my arrival.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elyoufox,Youness wrote a review Aug 2019,Youness,United Arab Emirates,12 contributions,1 helpful vote,Abu Dhabi - Agadir,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r701782055-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Assistant sales manager,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Need to vent.
Made the mistake of traveling on Royal Air Moroc.
First of all they canceled my return flight and rescheduled it without sending me the new ticket. my husband had to call 6 times to try to reschedule it again.
Long story short, we arrived JFK on August after an hour and a half delay at Casablanca only to find out that non of our luggage has arrived! We were advised to make a claim at the airport, which we did. At the beginning, we thought it was a mistake and that it was only us who lost our luggage but at the airport we found out that almost 30 other families didn’t receive their luggage, we were also told by one of the airport employees that it is a customary for this company to lose passengers luggage! I Googled it and to my surprise I found out that it is true..
Air Maroc acts as if it is not their fault and it is only the ground service’s fault. Which is completely absurd . Air Maroc took our luggage while they knew they had a problem going on since June. They knew very well that our luggage won’t be safe in their position, yet they kept thier operation going as if nothing is happening! It is a systematic problem that they don’t do anything about to solve. Now I can’t feel but robbed by them!
Who do I turn to to help me with this? How come this company can get away with this kind of irresponsible attitude against their clients?

"This is the first time I’ve flown with Air Maroc and I am traumatized by the experience. I flew into DC with 2 luggages for a permanent move. Those 2 luggages were basically all I had- my most important belongings and they never showed up. And it’s unbelievable but I am being given 0 hope that they will ever be found. It’s insane, I’m in a new country with nothing left. It’s so cruel and I am in shock that people can be so awful and we can be so helpless against them.
So please don’t do it. I know their flights are cheaper and I personally didn’t have any problems with the in-flight food or entertainment. But I arrived at the airport to see lots of people filing claims for luggages that didn’t show up. Since then, I’ve been asking social media, and air maroc itself for an example of someone with a happy ending and I get nothing. It’s not just that my favorite, most important belongings are gone now. But the feeling that someone can pretty much steal from you and that you can’t do anything is horrible.
It’s not funny. It’s not like all the other airlines where the luggage shows up a few days later and we think the airline is terrible for it. People are writing about lost luggages since November.
The people who are saying it’s not Air Maroc’s but the ground service’s fault is ridiculous. I gave my luggage to Air Maroc with the belief that they would keep it safe. I would happily carry it in the plane with me if I was allowed to, but that’s the rule, the airline company says we’ll take those off your hands and give it back to you when you get off the plane. So if they’re not giving it back, it is their fault. Plus, the idea that they know that they won’t be able to keep the luggages safe (given that this is a systematic problem) but still promise you that they will is criminal and cruel and disgustingly irresponsible to me. I didn’t know there was a strike in casablanca. It wasn’t my responsibility to know, it was the airline’s responsibility to notify me. To know that luggages are systematically being lost and to act like nothing is wrong and just continue to take people’s bags is absolutely horrible.
Please don’t fly with them. Or at least take whatever reviews you’re reading here very seriously and make sure you’re prepared for the worst case scenarios.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439gizema,Gizem A wrote a review Aug 2019,Gizem A,"Harrisonburg, Virginia",6 contributions,3 helpful votes,Istanbul - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r698812776-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Please don’t fly with them,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am an experienced traveler who rarely writes reviews and has never written a negative review. I am making an exception for my trip on Royal Air Maroc because I feel a duty to warn other travelers about this airline.

We chose Royal Air Marocbecause the tickets for a three-leg trip from Washington DC to Marrakech to Paris and back were significantly cheaper than any other airline. We paid just over $1,000 per person and the next cheapest price we got from any other airline was almost double that amount. Unfortunately, sometimes you get what you pay for.

First, due to a schedule change in our first flight, our connecting flight in Casablanca was pushed back, resulting in a 7 hour layover. Royal Air Maroc notified us of the changed flight itinerary but whomever input the changes made an error that caused ripple effects throughout the remainder of our trip. At each leg we were forced to watch as helpless RAM reps made baffled looks at their computer screens, only to be told that our reservation was not confirmed. Each time I had to show a print-out of the email I received stating that it was, indeed, confirmed. The email was apparently enough to get a boarding pass for each flight but not for the subsequent connection, nor could our bags be checked in through their final destination. This forced us to go through the same check-in process again at each airport we passed through. For our Casablanca to Paris leg we were told by airport reps that our reservation was lost but the RAM customer service desk would open at 9:00 a.m. to fix the error. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 7:30 a.m....

We were eventually able to get on each of our scheduled (or rescheduled) flights but not without jumping through frustrating hoops at each airport. The flights we worked so hard to get on were the worst I've ever experienced.

Bad food.
3 of 6 flights were delayed by at least 45 minutes
The boarding process at Casablanca is chaos that involves a bus and a tarmac boarding, each of which require checking boarding passes and passports. Boarding took over an hour.
The bathrooms were so filthy that on the Casablanca to Dulles leg two of the bathrooms were unuseable by mid-flight. The bathrooms were not cleaned, nor were they taken out of service. The passengers just refused to use them because of their poor condition.
Then, the best part of all was the lost luggage. Both of our checked bags failed to make it onto the plane from Casablanca to Dulles. It has been 9 days and we have no reliable information about where our bags are. Depending on what RAM rep answers the phone we are told they are in Paris or in Casablanca or at Dulles. When we arrived in Dulles the lost baggage attendant showed us a row of 34 bags that came off our plane. They were bags that had been lost and were now being redelivered. The attendant said some had been missing ""for weeks."" No one can tell us where our bags are or when we might be reunited with them. The only saving grace is that since the RAM lost baggage office at Dulles only operates from 2pm to 10pm Wednesday, Friday and Sunday (???!) we only go through the frustration of talking to these people three days per week.

If you are thinking of booking a flight with this airline, I would strongly advise that you consider booking a flight with any other airline at any cost.

I will never never never again take this plane they lost my luggage and lost luggages of many people coming from montreal to Tunis transit Casa on the 9th of august.

Yes it is my fault that you lose my luggage. what's  weird 3days now and they didn't even know where are the luggages  they don't know if it still in Montreal or went to casa (transit) it doesn't make sense at all after 3 days I'm starting thinking the luggage is lost already and reading the reviews here and on many websites I don't think I will get any reimbursement as well I'm just disgusted and frustrated since my ticket is a round flight and when back to Montreal I don't want to check in with any luggage  I will try to have only carry on and then never again this company thanks RAM for make me lose all my stuff and thanks for making my vacation the worst vacation ever thanks for ruining my days make sure I will post bad reviews everywhere,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oumayaa2016,Oumaya A wrote a review Aug 2019,Oumaya A,"Montreal, Canada",1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Montreal - Tunis,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r698571456-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst company ever,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I took this airline for the first time from NY city to Ghana. I will say that customer service is absolutely terrible. The flight attendants were extremely rude and seemed to be annoyed when you asked for something. They walked around the cabin the entire time looking panicked. I was in an aisle set and was pushed or hit several times by the staff and they never said excuse me or apologized. The food was subpar to say the least. And they ran out of certain dishes each flight. Why they wouldn't have more is besides me. Overall, there was no issue with flight time or leaving. That was the only good part about this airline. On my return flight to NYC, the plane didnt have the air on cool enough, it was hot for the entire 4 hour ride and when I hit the assist button, I waited over an hour and no one ever came to check to see what I needed.

The line at JFK to get in the plane was absolute madness. No organization no line just a free for all. Very frustrating. On the plane the flight attendants were very helpful and welcoming but the food is the absolute worst airplane food I’ve come across. I’m a tall girl and I sat comfortably in Economy but I however prefer their bigger planes it’s more modern and comfortable. JFK to Casablanca was a big plane. Casablanca to Ghana was an older plane. The counter girl  at the Ghana airport was the worst. She checked in my carry on Instead if allowing me to bring the weight down to the 10 kilos. I was only 3 kilos over. Then she caught an attitude when I told her. I’m not a rude person but while she was trying to smooth the situation  I turn my back on her and walked away.

"alright, I admit I ultimately chose to fly Royal Air Maroc because it was cheap and flew the large Boeing plane (so no big fear of crashing).  However we were completely entranced by the staff, the ground personnel and our fellow passengers.  The flight left on time, the plane was roomy and the number of happy staff were a pleasure after flying on U.S. airlines to California and the Caribbean.  We also enjoyed watching our fellow passengers  who seemed to represent the Islamic world, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean.  It was really a treat to see, hear and talk to such a diverse passenger base.  We had to transfer to a slightly smaller plane to travel from Casablanca airport to Lisbon and the layover was almost exactly one hour, as promised, and fairly seamless.  The return trip to JFK was more of the same and just as enjoyable, with a longer layover which allowed us to take in the wide variety of people traveling from the hub of Casablanca to the middle east, the Persian Gulf, Africa and even, I think, Indonesia.  The reality of special waiting areas set aside for women only, the provision of special areas set aside for prayers, and the ""similar but slightly different"" travel experience made this airline an integral part of our travel experience.  After all, the ""same but different-ness"" is an important part of what we look for in travel.  All in all, it was a wonderful experience, and if they could have done a slightly better job in announcing the gate or dealing with the usual issues that arise when moving a few hundred travelers from the U.S. to other parts of the world, well that's part of travel too.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eh2bh2eh,eh2bh2eh wrote a review Aug 2019,eh2bh2eh,"New York City, New York",13 contributions,7 helpful votes,New York City - Lisbon,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r695900635-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"""I'd fly them again in a quick minute""",Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This is by far the worst airline I’ve ever used to travel. It seems that when we landed EVERY single person on the flight was also complaining that their luggage had either been broken or lost. My baggage was also lost and it’s been a week of calling the customer service non stop and getting nothing done with Royal Air Maroc Airline. It seems that none of them want their jobs and are very rude. My luggage is still missing and I no longer know what to do. You call and they tell you call this number instead and you call that number and they tell you the exact same thing. It’s a horrible vicious repeat.

"PLEASE DON'T EVER FLY THIS AIRLINE!!!  Flying from Barcelona to Boston last weekend.  Our flight was delayed about 3 hours leaving BCN- we were assured that they would hold our connecting flight in Morocco since we were going to be about 10 minutes late.  Got to Morocco and the flight had already left. What happened next is the stuff of nightmares.  If I told you the whole story we would be here all day, but in a nutshell we spent 5 hours at the Casablanca airport before we had tickets in hand for a flight leaving the next day. This was after talking to several RAM staff members who would say they were working on it and then just walked away from us - including one person whose shift was over so he just left all of us sitting there waiting while he went home for the day.  In the end, we did get booked on another flight and they gave us a hotel voucher but no meal allowance or anything. It is now 4 days after I have arrived home and we still don't have our bags.  Customer Service is less than interested in assisting. Every time I call, I get yelled at by the agent which is par for the course based on how they treated us when we were at the airport in Morocco.

﻿Today I was supposed to fly to Casablanca with Air Maroc. Initially the plane was a little late in boarding however once on board several things occurred which meant the plane could not depart. During this time there was no update from the captain and crew regarding the cause of the issues nor did the crew provide water to the full cabin of passengers. Three hours later the crew provided several pieces of information 1. There was a technical fault with the plane and no engineers were available to fix it 2. The captain was happy to fly the plane regardless of being told by ground staff that they wouldn’t sign the plane off 3. The crew were running out of hours and an extension had been sought. It seems the captain was quite happy to fly a plane that had a technical issue and for which the crew were out of flying hours. Eventually the passengers were irate from not having information and from very little care from the crew regarding water or snacks while waiting. We were told we could get off but we’re immediately asked to sit and wait longer as no ground staff could be found to receive us. Eventually we off loaded and were directed to return to the check in desks where we would get more information. Nothing! We waited for several hours while one member of gatwick staff sorted hotels and transport. At about 11pm the staff started to say they couldn’t find any more hotel rooms in the Gatwick area and we were sent to wait outside at buses. I was told which hotel they had booked me into and sent off. The hotel I was sent to had no rooms left and it is now 1.20am and I have had to organise taxis to other hotels and organise and pay for my own room. This is incredibly expensive! The service all day from Air Maroc has been rude and trying to get rid of us. Their planes are old and tatty and no inflight entertainment. I have no idea if I will be reimbursed. I really recommend that you do not fly with them as this is truly the worst flying experience I have ever had.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahrH5572KL,sarahrH5572KL wrote a review Jul 2019,sarahrH5572KL,Dubai,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,London - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r694235095-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,DO NOT FLY ROYAL AIR MAROC,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"To whom it may concern:
I am extremely upset and disappointed with the way Royal Air Maroc has treated my lost baggage claim and the way they have taken me as a joke, therefore I request full compensation for the lost bag, the days with no clothes, all of the clothing in the bag, the time lost, and the terribly upsetting experience I have had.
Let me take you through the story:
On Friday July 26th, 2019 I was moving from Barcelona to Williamsburg to start a new phase in my life. I applied for a full time MBA as an international student and got in. This was the day I was moving from one place to the other.
This date let’s remember it (July 26th, 2019) I took Flight 965 from Barcelona to Casablanca. A pleasant flight no issues, service was great, flight was on time, everything ok if not perfect. After this I took the 4:35 pm flight from Casablanca to Barcelona. Again, during the flight the service was good, the flight was on time, and overall the experience was fine. This was my second time taking this flight. So far the first time had been good and now the second time it had been good so far. Even though I had heard their client flight services were not very good, so far it had been a good experience. Why not try it again?
I arrived to Dulles international airport that night at 8:00pm Washington time. This was when it all started, after immigration I went to baggage claim, all the bags had already been taken out of the baggage conveyor belt and they were lying on the floor. At this point I started looking for my 2 bags. In a few minutes I spotted my first bag, a grey hardtop bag. I spent the next 30 minutes looking for my other bag, asking around, looking in different conveyor belts, walking, and nothing was to be found. At that point I went to the RAM (Royal Air Morocco) claim desk. When I got there, as soon as I got there a front desk worker asked me “is your name on this list”. Indeed it was. At that point, I thought to myself why not tell passengers to look if their name was on the list at first rather than tell them to keep looking. But sure, no problem there was a lot of people, something I could understand. I said “yes, my name is here. I am this person”. Therefore the front desk worker said “your bag never boarded in Casablanca, please fill out your information so we can send you the bag as soon as it is here” sounded like everything was under control, I said ok. Followed, by filling out the information sheet. Gave it to her, I asked, “Is that it?” she said “yes, we will send you an email confirmation with the information, here are 2 contact numbers, and that would be it. You can leave.” Before leaving thankfully I took a picture of the information sheet so I could have evidence of it. And proceeded to go home. This was Friday night.
Day 2) - July 27, 2019- I woke up Saturday, looked at my email, and nothing. I thought it was a bit strange so I decided to call them on the numbers that appear on the attached sheet. Surprisingly, no answer. I later read, the claim desk only worked Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday from 2:30 pm to 10:30 pm. So, Ok, no problem.
Day 3) - July 28, 2019- I woke up on Sunday, and no email, no contact, nothing. Now I was starting to get a bit concerned. On the first call no answer, on the second call, no answer. I had a bad vibe, so l tried the other number the (1-800) this time they picked up. A client service woman picked up, and as I was describing my problem. The phone call shut off. No problem, I called again. This time, it was a man who helped me. At this point I described my problem and the man asked me for a claim number. Saying they should have given me a claim number, confused, I said no sir, the baggage claim front desk did not give me a claim number on Friday. I asked “can we look it up with my bag number?” he said yes. I gave him my bag number and he insisted this was not my bag. At this point, I was starting to get very frustrated, As I had my baggage tags and the person on the line said these bags did not belong to me. He followed by saying I had to do a new claim because there was no information about myself in the system and I had to go online to make a new claim. I said this makes no sense I don’t understand, but if that is what you say I will try doing it. He hung up. Obviously, I had no idea how to do the claim. I called again, can you help me with the claim. He said it is on the website and was trying to hang up again and aing. We ended up hanging the phone 4 times!! Because he was never willing to stay in the line for more than 2 minutes. Thankfully all these conversations are recorded. Around my 5th call, a different person picked up. Explained it to her, and this time I gave her my bag numbers and she said my name. I said yes that me, I felt a bit relieved she said yes there is a claim it was input on the 27th of July .The claim is number IADAT11070. Huh? That made no sense, I came in on the 26th, on the 27th no one picked up, and on the 28th the first person said there was no claim for this bag. Something sketchy was going on. She said “we have no additional information about your bag, no data has been updated” she kept on saying this. Are you kidding me, this is the 3rd day with no clothes, and the first person is trying to hang up on me, telling me I have to make a new claim. And the second assistant is telling me there is no data, and that I can keep calling to see if there is any additional information. That same day I called during the late afternoon around 6. And I got the same response, there is no additional information for claim IADAT11070.
DAY.4) - July 29, 2019- That morning I called again, surprisingly. No answer at first. Again once they answered they said no information. No additional information. At this point it’s the 4th day and that all I get. No information, no help no nothing not even an email or a call!? It would be better if they say your bag is lost! Or what is going on rather than keep on leading you on. At this point I have one pair of clothes! All of my clothes are in that bag! I was very upset, I have no information about my bag, they keep on trying to lead me on and hang up on me every time I call. They show zero responsiveness towards the client. And they say I cannot contact the claim department. Only by email. Hence I am writing this email.
Day 5) - July 30, 2019- I called again and this time Abda received my call. I gave him my claim number IADAT 11070. He was very responsive, however again he said, “There is no additional information on the claim. For the time being there are no new updates. There is a flight today from Casablanca to Dulles. You should try calling again after 19:59. If you buy any cloth you should have an invoice, and make a claim with these invoice so we can refund the purchase of clothes”. Again we are in the same place we started.
Therefore, at this point I am not even angry anymore. But let’s remember it’s the 5th day with no responsiveness by Royal Air Maroc towards his client, not one single email, not a single call on their side. Therefore, I am expecting a full refund for the lost bag, the clothes in the bag, the days with no clothes, and the terribly upsetting experience I have had. For this I have attached the sheet I filled in the first day, all of the receipts from the clothes that were in the bag, and the receipts for the clothes I have had to buy for every day I have not had any clothes to wear.
Thank you, I will be expecting a response as soon as possible.

"RAM offers the cheapest tickets Montreal-Accra but it comes at a cost: The flight schedule which you lose a night of sleep each way, as the plane arrives and leaves Accra in the middle of the night.
Food and customer service were OK.
The plane used for the Accra-Casablanca leg is probably one of the oldest on the fleet, with very little leg room and no individual TV screen. They show a common movie, like they did in the old days. They also offer an entertainment system on your own device but the choice is extremely limited. I recommend downloading Netflix content before heading out on your trip.

"Royal Air Maroc has some of the most incompetent people and incomprehensible policies we have ever seen. My husband was flying in from Bangui, CAR and his flight had been delayed. I was flying in from NYC and we were meeting in Casablanca before heading to Senegal. But because his flight had been delayed, he, and 8 other passengers, had been ""flagged"" and were no longer allowed to board the plane to Senegal. We were shocked. Being told you can't board right before boarding. And they couldn't give us any valid reason. They forced these 8 innocent people to leave the terminal. I boarded the plane and immediately contacted my husband to let him know his seat and at least 7-8 other passenger seats were empty. I pleaded with the staff to let him on board but that because he wasn't at the terminal anymore he would have to board the next flight (5 hours later.) They did mention that the ""supervisor"" would come and resolve this issue. So here i am, left alone, given conflicting information. The workers inside telling me ""why isn't he here at the gate"" and the people at the gate telling him  ""please leave the terminal"". IT MADE NO SENSE AT ALL!! I told him the ""supervisor"" was the only chance for him to board. So he demanded to be taken to the ""supervisor"" by the plane door because he was being expected, which was a total exaggeration of what i had tried explaining to him. But the lie worked and he was miraculously allowed to board the plane. MIRACLE! is the key word. All the other passengers that had been denied entry were forced to take the following flight even though their seats were empty!!! I have never heard of any airline allowing empty seats just because the passengers previous flight had been delayed. Apparently this creates a conflict in the computer system for Royal Air Maroc and their tiny brains can't seem to use logic to figure out what is wrong. TOTAL INCOMPETENCE.

"The present review is based upon 8 flight legs, in April and July 2019. The short of it is, the airline's operation manual is not up to international standards of service.

The fleet is mostly from Boeing. Transiting via Casablanca is close to compulsory (the new terminal is quite messy, with gates indicated on boarding card different from the ones indicated inside the terminal, gates D not to be found even between gates C and E, and staff fed up to be asked where are the gates D).

Let us pass on a failure to check passenger visas, which is a major failure, resulting in fines by IATA. Issue management was performed with absolutely no concern for passengers.

A few items of quality that would not cost much to fix are the spellings, in the website as well as in the in-flight magazine (even on the cover page, Morroco instead of Morocco). This is a good starting point as an indication for the airline's low level of self-respect.

Invariably, the check-in and boarding procedures are quite slow and utterly inefficient: several queues with no indication of which is which, people asked to stand in queues for much longer that necessary, etc. At some point, the plane was not coming at the boarding gate, but the crew knowingly waited as much as they could before telling the passengers that they have been waiting in vain. In one occasion (a check-in and boarding in Madrid), an employee took on himself to manage the queues, and it worked wonders: passengers were directed, luggage sizes were checked, queues were minimal, and the boarding took place with no delay.

The food was ok. The small sample of trout from the Atlas mountain (apparently some local speciality of smoked river fish that resembles salmon) deserves a special mention.

On-board service shows a few mistakes, such as toilets being cared for haphazardly.

In our opinion, it would take little energy to improve boarding operating processes. Management of delays and passenger communication will probably take longer to fix. In the meantime, we will take this airline only if no viable alternative exists.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127Fred,127Fred wrote a review Jul 2019,127Fred,"London, United Kingdom",581 contributions,198 helpful votes,London - Dakar,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r692403887-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Poor standards of operations and service,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I would like to like Royal Air Maroc. As a Moroccan, there is a certain amount of national proud and so many memories associated with this airline. RAM has some undeniable qualities. Food on board is generally good. Service, while not world class, has a nice Moroccan warmth to it. Pilots seem to be competent with very smooth landings often met with applause. But when RAM let’s you down, it let’s you down in a spectacular fashion. When they overbook the flight and can’t find you a seat, when they cancel a flight, when they lose one of your luggage, you gotta use some powerful prayers, a well funded credit card and a dalaï lamaesque patience to get back your normal human life. For RAM, a customer that is undergoing RAM generated issues....has no existence on this earth. No one is supposed to hear their problem nor solve their problem. It is a limbo where you lose any detectable level of human dignity. You are warned. And RAM, if you get your s***t together, I may come back one day and be delighted.

"We, along with the other thousands of RAM passengers who have “lost” their luggage in recent weeks are understandably upset about not having our luggage and having trips ruined. However, what makes RAM so horrible and criminal is that at each of their airports that connect to Casablanca, they are knowingly, KNOWINGLY, allowing passengers to check-in their luggage without any expectation that they will be able to get their luggage at their destination. Entire planes are landing without any of the passengers luggage onboard. Not only do that not tell passengers but the airports know as well but don’t warn passengers. They are complicit and criminal. Furthermore, RAM won’t answer their phones or correspondence. After we returned to Casablanca to get our luggage in person, they denied that it was even there, stating that it was still in Lisbon, even though their own electronic tracking system and our luggage GPS clearly show that the luggage made it to and was still in Casablanca.
Never have we seen an airline do everything it could to sabotage their customers plans.
The root of this problem is that they don’t care about passengers and they let their internal issues between management and the luggage handlers result in this catastrophe.
They have had four luggage handler strikes in recent weeks and neither RAM nor the airports feel that it is in their interest to let passengers know when this happens. Their pilots had labor issues recently as well. Do you think RAM will let you know when they start putting unqualified or otherwise dangerous pilots in the sky? What about their mechanics? How long before their planes start falling out of the sky? How can anyone trust them?

I have been flying extensively since childhood, since 1979. Over the last 10 years, I've averaged about 400,000km a year. I have flown most airlines in the world. Royal Air Maroc is by far the most egregiously horrible airline and if you're reading this and still fly with them, you've gone forward knowing full well that what they are capable of doing and may God be with you.

However, what makes RAM so horrible and criminal is that at each of their airports that connect to Casablanca, they are knowingly, KNOWINGLY, allowing passengers to check-in their luggage without any expectation that they will be able to get their luggage at their destination. Entire planes are landing without any of the passengers luggage onboard. Not only do that not tell passengers but the airports know as well but don’t warn passengers. They are complicit and criminal. Furthermore, RAM won’t answer their phones or correspondence. After we returned to Casablanca to get our luggage in person, they denied that it was even there, stating that it was still in Lisbon, even though their own electronic tracking system and our luggage GPS clearly show that the luggage made it to and was still in Casablanca.
Never have we seen an airline do everything it could to sabotage their customers plans.
The root of this problem is that they don’t care about passengers and they let their internal issues between management and the luggage handlers result in this catastrophe.
They have had four luggage handler strikes in recent weeks and neither RAM nor the airports feel that it is in their interest to let passengers know when this happens. Their pilots had labor issues recently as well. Do you think RAM will let you know when they start putting unqualified or otherwise dangerous pilots in the sky? What about their mechanics? How long before their planes start falling out of the sky? How can anyone trust them?",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L87SGmichaelr,Michael R wrote a review Jul 2019,Michael R,"New York City, New York",199 contributions,112 helpful votes,Casablanca - Lisbon,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r691075172-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"What more can I say?

"Unbelievably bad airline. I’ve flown at least 20-30 airlines, including plenty of low-rated ones. I always choose the cheapest option because I am not picky; I don’t really care about the food or even the service. However, I’ll never fly Royal Air Maroc (RAM) again. Where to start? My family flew RAM from the US to Italy (connecting through Casablanca) because it was the cheapest option. They lost our luggage on the way to Bologna. I understand it happens. No problem, except that even after six days there was still no baggage, no information, and no apology. They just told us to stop calling because they would call us when they found it. Good thing we speak some Italian because nobody on the other end spoke any English (or French...). (I don’t expect anyone else to speak “my” language, but if you work for an international airline you should really speak a couple.) We got back to the US two days ago, and no luggage again. The number we were given to call has an answering machine saying their mailbox is full. I’m not holding my breath that we’ll see it anytime soon. I understand that baggage goes missing for many reasons, but other airlines take responsibility, provide information, and sometimes provide a clothing/toiletry stipend.

As for the flights... we're easy going and don't need to be treated like royalty, but on one leg the attendants seemed to go out of their way to be rude, and didn't seem to like their jobs very much. Worst of all was the check in desk agent at the Bologna airport. I had selected seats 3 months ago so our family (including 2 kids) would be together. Before printing the boarding passes, the agent informed me that she “had changed our seats to better seats.” I asked her to change them back, but she claimed she couldn’t. I insisted, showing her the e-ticket with the seats I had chosen. Then her story changed and she said she hadn’t changed them. Long story short—our family didn’t sit together on either homebound leg. I could say more (the boarding process for one flight involved everyone on the flight standing in a weird stairwell lit by one fluorescent light for half an hour; every flight was delayed, simply because they don’t know how to board a plane with any sense of efficiency, etc.), but will just say my experience with RAM has convinced me that sometimes—even for people who aren’t picky—the airline does matter, and this is one to avoid at all cost.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler1213141511,Traveler wrote a review Jul 2019,Traveler,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Bologna - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r690671488-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Never again,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently had the pleasure of flying Royal Air Maroc for 4 separate flights (Washington DC to Casablanca, Casablanca to Amsterdam, Lyon to Casablanca, and Casablanca to DC). The day before I left, I came on Trip Advisor and started to panic when I saw such negative feedback for the airline. I've flown a lot internationally but never before with them, and I have to say, I need not have worried. My experiences were BETTER than most flights I've taken on other major carriers.

Luggage (my biggest worry after reading the reviews): Bags arrived in a timely fashion with zero issues. Meanwhile, friends who traveled separately on Air France and Brussels Air both had their bags lost and had to spend days without their belongings. Many years ago I learned (the hard way) that whenever you have a connecting flight, make sure the bag tag is marked for your final destination and not just your connecting city. Sure, bags can still miss connections, but I have yet to get burned since I started religiously checking the tags.

Timing: Two of my flights were minimally delayed, but I consider that par for the course with the current state of the airline industry. One of the delays was in order to wait for some connecting passengers, which they clearly appreciated!

Comfort/amenities: All 4 planes were more comfortable and with more leg room than I've come to expect from U.S. economy flights. The transatlantic flights have outlets and USB ports, fancy screens with lots of video content, and high-tech window dimmers. The Africa-to-Europe planes were smaller and older, but still great. I appreciated that one of these shorter flights showed a silent movie on the communal above-aisle TV screens - not disruptive and a nice touch!

Food: Wow, a full hot meal for a three-hour flight? Unheard of! I had complete meal service on all four of my flights, and the longer flights came with two meals. None of the meals were repeats and they always had at least two options. I find my taste buds don't respond the same way when I'm flying, so to me it just seemed like standard airplane food, but it made me very happy. In addition to cold drink service at the start of the flight, they offer tea and/or coffee at the conclusion of each meal. I highly recommend the tea - I'm not a huge tea drinker and I nonetheless enjoyed this small taste of Morocco!

Service: Staff were friendly, impressively multi-lingual, and helpful.

Boarding/airport experience: This is where I suspect some of the negativity may be coming from in other reviews. If you fly U.S.-based airlines a lot, or are a novice traveler, some of the procedures might be different enough to confuse you. I was absolutely fine, however, just paying attention to what was going on and following directions accordingly. Just because it was different does not make it bad or wrong.
- The line to check bags in D.C. was very long, and it appears they have a short window to check in bags (if I remember correctly, 1-3 hours before the flight). If you have a connecting flight, make sure to get both boarding passes at your departure airport, so you won't have to wait in line again in between the flights.
- Boarding is no-frills - everyone forms a single-file line and boards the plane. No boarding groups or anything. This makes the line appear longer, but really it didn't cause any problems. I think I might actually prefer the simplicity? I am also pretty sure the flights boarded a little earlier than I'm used to. Just arrive early and pay attention.
- Casablanca airport was a cool place to stop over! Modern airport with ample food options, etc. We had to take buses to/from the gates, but I've done that in so many airports; it's not unique to Royal Air Maroc. Personally I really enjoyed stepping foot in an ""extra"" country on my way to Europe.
- Entering Europe and Morocco were no problems, but the final leg of my flight had an extra layer of security. For a U.S.-bound flight from Casablanca, we had to be patted down again before going to our gate. They also took away water and other large liquids that had been purchased in the Casablanca airport. This is NOT the fault of the airline, but rather due to a U.S.-government policy requiring the extra security. So I refuse to hold that against them. They were very polite about it.

Bottom line is, bad experiences can happen on any airline due to all sorts of factors outside of their control. I almost never write reviews, but I wanted to add my voice to the mix and suggest that there's also a great possibility of having a wonderful trip with Royal Air Maroc, like I did. I would absolutely fly them again and recommend them to my friends. I feel like I came away with a great deal, superior flight experience, and tiny cultural exchange (was fun to chat with Tunisian seatmate, see the Arabic writing all over the airport, etc.).",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whereismrslarance,J.L. wrote a review Jul 2019,J.L.,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Washington DC - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r689311772-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Wonderful experience - I don't understand such negative reviews!,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"There is nothing ""Royal"" about Air Maroc, and this is coming from a Business Class passengers:

1. We flew to Barcelona with a leg in Casablanca, each one of the four flight was delayed, no kidding, and not by 2 minutes, serious delays. If we didn't have a loooong layover, we would probably missed our flights on both directions. One of them was actually due to a passenger on board with NO BOARDING TICKET. The whole plane had to sit and wait until they will figure it out while the flight attendant and ground attendant were puzzled on how it happened. Yes, they arranged a ticket, passenger stayed.
2.You have a pre-checked security? Can't use it, they are not ""participating"", so add at least an hour for your airport arrival.
3.It might sound like a bad joke, but the pilots are actually smoking on flight, Sitting in Business Class we could have smelled it and the flight attendant was not too shy to explain where the smell was coming from.
4. You want your luggage back? forget about it! It happened to us once before with United, you go to the desk, get a claim number and an hour later you can check your bag location online, and get the suitcase within 24 hours, easy, right? Not with Air Maroc: We filled in a piece of paper, and then we had to call for a follow up, but pay attention, we could only call 3 times a week for a 5 hours window. We did that, after hours of calling, someone asked me to give him 30 minutes to put the claim in the system. It took me 2 days to catch him on the phone again, just so he could tell me he is doing it right now.... Claim number was useless, because the status was ""unknown"" , we could not talk to anyone that could provide more information, and when we wanted to escalate, the customer service representative said that ""her manager does not take calls""....
We got the suitcases eventually after almost a week. No apology, no explanation, status is still ""unknown"".

Lounge in Casablanca was very unimpressive, and don't get me started with the strangest chairs set up (the window bed is significantly higher than the aisle bed, something like a bunk bed, no way to get out to the bathroom).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/45/8e/cb/dearlili.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DearLiLi,DearLiLi wrote a review Jul 2019,DearLiLi,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",92 contributions,6 helpful votes,Washington DC - Barcelona,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r688677884-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Chaos!,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was our first time to fly RAM, and overall, it was a great experience. The best part were the transatlantic flights from JFK to Casablanca on 787 Dreamliners. Wow, what an amazing aircraft. If possible, I'd fly on a 787 all the time! The flight attendants were wonderful, and service was first rate.
The short (approx. 1hr) flight to and from LIS were fine, on smaller aircraft.
Where RAM could do a bit better is in providing timely updates regarding flight delays. We had a few delays, but nothing serious, and at least one was clearly weather related. Also, the RAM website is not at the same level that other airlines have. We ended up having to call in to their call center to purchase our tickets, and this was also a bit less streamlined a process than with other airlines. However, in the end the value and the service were great.

"Last 3rd June I flew from Lagos, Nigeria to Madrid, Spain. My flight should have taken off at 6:10 am from Lagos but due to the great amount of extra suitcases, bags & luggage in general many passengers had with them; we left 45 minutes later.
It was astonished for me to see personally there, how the crew from this airline at the airport accepted money in cash from the passengers when they had overweight of their baggage. Bribing most of them!!
However, this wasn't the last remark, when flying the catering was ridiculous & the crew wasn't very friendly at all. There were suitcases everywhere, up & down the seats, in the corridors 🙄
My transfer was in Casablanca, 5 hours!! But guess what? The flight was delayed 90 minutes longer, it was crazy to check the screens. From time to time they changed the boarding gate & we were all the time checking it not to miss our flight.
Once in my way to Madrid, nobody in the flight spoke a word of Spanish, just French, Arabic & a kind of English. And nobody gave a reason for the delay...
And the same inside the plane, luggage everywhere!!
Obviously, the prices on this airline to fly from Europe to Africa & on the other way around are cheaper. But for God sake if the plane is overloaded under previous bribes & the food is awful, the transfer takes 6.5 hours:
Better to pay more & fly safe & sound!!😊",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/11/00/08/veph.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAULALEXGC,PAULALEXGC wrote a review Jul 2019,PAULALEXGC,"Madrid, Spain",31 contributions,18 helpful votes,Lagos - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r688200806-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Flying with Royal Air Maroc uploaded of extra luggage & hours of delay.,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have mixed emotions about this airline. I had to take two flights out of the US to Europe with the change of planes in Morocco. On my way to Europe my first flight was late for about 2 hours and then in Morocco for another hour. The airplane was old and dirty and service was just alright. Not to mention that the whole process into walking to the terminal in Morocco is out of this world... takes like a lifetime. On my way back, both flights were delayed as well but at least the plane was newer and cleaner. Food is not that bad for ""plane food.""
Another issue is that they share counter space in Miami so you have to wait until it is their turn to check in and leave your suitcase. If you have a long layover you are stuck with your luggage until they open I thought that was a pain.
I do not think I will use this airline again, the price was not worth all the inconveniences.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivianE142,Vivian E wrote a review Jul 2019,Vivian E,"Houston, Texas",38 contributions,7 helpful votes,Miami - Marseille,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r688183331-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Crazy late!,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No real complaints on flight from JFK to Casablanca. However, the return flight from Casablanca to JFK was a different story. The flight was full and many passengers  on the flight seemed as though this was their first time to fly. The staff seemed less than helpful to these passengers  which also impacted our experience. Worst of all, after the long flight home we sat on the plane at JFK for 1 hour and 45 minutes. The reason given was that no gate was available to deplane. So was this a JFK or RAM issue...have not a clue. After deplaning, we just wanted to get to our hotel. Who knows how many people missed their connecting flight. Sitting on the tarmac at JFK  was  where the RAM service was worst or perhaps non-existent. After the initial announcement of the gate issue, no more updates were provided, no water or other service, no assistance using the restrooms which at this point were disgusting. So the flight over was ok; the return flight was horrible so which is more typical?

"I flew from Washington Dulles (IAD) to Malaga, Spain through Casablanca on Royal Air Maroc (which is not so royal).This airline should go out of business before there is a crash.  And if there is, the complacent flight attendants will abandon ship first without helping others.First flight (RAM219)  from Dulles to Casablanca was fine.  The second flight (RAM984) was delayed.  We were given very little information.  “You will receive information in 10 minutes.” Followed by the same announcement 3 times.  1 hour later, we boarded a bus where we sat for 20 minutes.  Got onto RAM984 – a propeller jet – which was very dirty, smelled of fumes, and had insects crawling on the interior window.  The plane sat on the runway for a long time (well more than an hour); attempted to take off and failed (no momentum to get in the air), and returned to the airport.  ""Technical difficulties."" We were disembarked and waited another 2 hours for a new plane (with no information from rude staff).Flight from Casablanca to DC (RAM218):  I wanted to purchase an upgrade.  Was told that “we don’t have a machine and we don’t take cash.”  (the woman in front of me had been overbooked and was given a free upgrade.)  The gate area was very crowded.  They made a boarding announcement and there was no organization (see photo).  No one told passengers where to go or what zones to use.  One of the zones was written on a piece of cardboard with a sharpie.  ....Then, we waited.  We were given the same RAM-standard statement, “You will receive information in 10 minutes.”  This happened 2 times.  People were getting very angry.  Ground staff called security who came and stood at the counter looking menacing.  Boarded the plane.  Stayed on the ground for more than an hour with no information from flight crew.  (Later learned from other passengers that it was a problem with the wing, ""Technical difficulties."")   We could see mechanics staring up at the underside of the wing. NOT reassuring and most of the passengers around me were fearful to fly.  We finally took off 3 hours after flight time.  Heavy landing in DC:  They should check that wing again.ALL the staff was rude and unhelpful.  They didn’t speak. They turned their backs when I (and other passengers) asked questions.  One flight attendant even poured water (by mistake?) on a passenger, and then rolled his eyes as if it was the seated passenger’s fault and walked away.  Another passenger got him tissues to dry off.I ate one of their snack meals (breakfast) and think I got food poisoning.  NEVER AGAIN.  This whole experience has actually put me off of Morocco in general (and I wanted to travel there.)

"Sadly this airline does not yet have the infrastructure nor the training to join other carriers. Large delays, zero info to passengers, indifferent staff on the ground. We travel internationally every year and yes when you travel, delays always occur. I've just never been subjected to this type of poor customer service. We flew the DC to Casablanca to Lisbon route RT. On our outbound we were delayed (with no explanation) 2 hours from Casablanca to Lisbon. On the return trip, it was a nightmare. An hour delay out of Lisbon to Casablanca. Then an almost 4 hour delay leaving for DC. I do appreciate that they did not take off until the plane was fixed but there was so much to be desired in how passengers were treated. In flight entertainment is good. Seats are pretty comfortable and recline pretty far. The food is not very good and while they provide blankets and pillows to everyone, they also collect them from you an hour before landing! I felt terrible for the people who had connectors on the ground in DC as repeated pages for RAM staff didn't appear to ellicit anyone to help them. Overall, they have a good conceptual product but the support is not yet in place. Their customer service staff is gruff and unresponsive in any way to help passengers. If they get 5 star customer service (like Qatar or Emirates), they would be excellent. The attractive pricing was not at all worth the aggravation.

"Do not fly Royal Air Maroc. They are not ready for prime time yet, which is a shame because they have a decent in flight product, particularly on their 787's. However, the return flight to the US was delayed by 3.5 hours. It happens, but what was frustrating and unacceptable was the airline provided no acknowledgments, apologies, updates or explanations whatsoever. Not once did a customer service rep say ""there is a delay in boarding, it is caused by x, we expect it to be resolved in Y minutes and we apologize for the inconvenience.""  We heard nothing. I have zero confidence that this airline could handle a complex situation with any competence. Also, checking into Casablanca airport is a nightmare, though transiting through is fine. Such a shame because they are flying brand new 787's from the US and the in flight service was decent (except the bizarre inability to acknowledge, let alone apologize for, the long delay).

"With Morocco’s poor record on human rights it may not be surprising  that Royal Air Maroc has sub standard policies and actions regarding communication. In the world of contemporary international travel not communicating with your customers/passengers is inexcusable. This is not a joke.  What happened below took place on July 6, 2019. There was no announcement regarding our gate change!  Huh?!?   A customer just noticed the change on the tv screen and shared the information.  And the gate was on a different level of the airport. So everyone went there and found NO staff.  As it was time to board that was confusing.  Moreover there was no plane. As people asked each other about the wait and reasons there was continued silence from RAM.  Not one text, email, or audio message. This is evidence of a company that is still acting like it is 1970 and has disdain for its customers.  Avoid them at all costs. Btw the plane was 90 minutes late meaning we left over two hours late.  No one was able to communicate that to people waiting for us.  RAM doesn’t belong in this field.  And they need tourism to rise as an Econ sector. They are a disgrace when it comes to customer service.  The apologetic email I received from them was another indicator that they are playing in yesterday’s market place.

"Actual flights - from IAD to CMN, then CMN to BCN (and return) were perfectly fine, decent food served, can try out Moroccan wine even. For that Royal Air Maroc gets a bonus point.

Now the ugly - everything in between is terrible. The one star reviews are all spot on. All our flights took off late. The leg from CMN to BCN was late over an hour because the gate crew couldn't figure out how to get the gate to connect to the airplane...so we ended up having to change gates, and take a bus for what could have been a simple 20 yard walk to the stairs of the plane.

Casablanca Airport - they check and recheck your tickets/passports over and over and over and over....we probably had 6 checks on our passports/tickets (airside - never left the airport - all international travel).

Trip from BCN to CMN was over 3 hours late - which caused a minor panic as we had a 2 hour connection for our flight home to IAD. Called Royal Air Maroc - they were useless and said we'd be fine we had over an hour to connect, said that's impossible as we hadn't even taken off for a 2 hour flight back to CMN and the next flight from CMN to IAD was supposed to take off in 2 hours....all good - any other airline we'd have missed the flight but this being Royal Air Maroc our flight back to IAD was over 3 hours late so we did end up with plenty of time for the connection.

Heed the warnings - do NOT check your luggage. We met countless people who had their luggage missing on all legs of the journey. RAM may have generous checked luggage policies but that's pointless if your bags are missing. We heeded the warnings from TA (ty guys!!) and never had to worry about losing luggage.

Only take this airline if you have to, if prices are MUCH lower than competitors, or you want to experience a truly kafka-esque system at work. Do not check your luggage and allow for a LOT of extra time between connections.

"Now that we received our luggage, this morning at 1am, from our Royal Air Marco (RAM) flight (Friday June 28th), I can tell you about this horrible experience.Avoid this airline, please!It started with our check-in at Gatwick, London last week.  The reason we decided on the flight was because it was cheap and offered us a short stay in Casablanca.  Big mistake.  After checking in Gatwick, we were told that the gate would be announced at 10:35.  We waited by a display board and watched as 10:35 past.  The next announcement post said that the gate would be displayed at 10:50.  This worried us since the flight was 'scheduled' to leave at 11:35.Well, 10:50 came and the gate was posted.  A mad rush of people pushed their way to the gate, checked-in and waited and waited.  At about 11:20 we began the boarding process.  Well, at the scheduled departure time we were still boarding.  At 11:50 the door was closed and we remained parked at the gate.We stayed there for one full hour.  The aircraft didn't even pull away from the gate.  We sat on the tarmac.  We were all fastened in our seats, no refreshments or entertainment for that hour.At 12:50 the pilot announced that there was a long line for take-off and he had been authorized to move into position.  We pulled back from  the gate and ever so slowly moved to the runway.  30 minutes later we were at the runway.So, to recap thus far:  1) delayed gate announcement 2) one hour wait at the gate in a hot plane, and 3) 30 minutes to the runway.  Relatively non-eventful flight, though we were an hour and a half late, with only a one and 40 minutes lay-over.We landed in lovely Casablanca and we ushered aboard buses that took us to the terminal.  We followed the signs that read ""flight connections"" where, with 20 minutes to catch our plane, we had to go through security again.We made it through this security check and ran to the gate.  At the gate they separated the male and female passengers and had set-up yet another check-point.Now, this would not have bothered so much, and I'm all for added security, but my daughter was in a line about six deep, where as I was the only one in my line.The male at the check-point asked for my nationality, I replied, ""United States"" and he let me in without checking my carry-on.  My daughter was still stuck in a line, female only, with attendants opening bags and pulling out items.  Let me point out, there were two female attendants in my line, who could have easily checked women passengers.Finally through we walked to the bus and were driven a rather circuitous route to our plane.  We rushed on-board, got settled, and yes, you guessed it, we waited.  Not the full hour, as was in Gatwick, but close to 30 minutes.   The safety briefing was a multi-language video, while the flight attendants sat in the galley.  The long flight was comfortable, with our safe landing at Dulles.Through Customs were made our way to the baggage claim and waited, and waited.  After the conveyor belt stopped, with no luggage, we went to the RAM baggage handler.  She had a list of bags that didn't make the flight.  That's right, both our bags were either in Gatwick or Casablanca, she did not know for certain.  We filled out the proper paperwork and were assured that the bags would be on the next flight.  Well, this being Friday, and RAM does not or did not have a Saturday flight, that would be Sunday.  We waited Sunday,  no calls or bags.  We waited Monday, no calls or bags.  Oh, did I mention that RAM has no listed telephone number at Dulles Airport, and there U.S. - based number is bounced to Casablanca.Tuesday we drove to Dulles and found the RAM baggage office closed, but it did open on 2 p.m. on flight days.  This was a flight day.  We waited until 2:15 p.m., no employee appeared and left.  I did copy down the telephone number posted on their office door.  When I called it a couple hours later the attendant asked how I ""got this number"".After a long and heated conversation regarding a claim number that had never been issued, I was given one.  With the claim number I continued to call Casablanca who advised that the our baggage had, not been found or already been sent to Dulles and was in storage.  They did not know for sure.Phone calls to the Dulles RAM office went unanswered, and the prospect of another drive to Dulles was in the works.Which brings us to the 1 a.m. pounding at our front door, and the surprise delivery.  Luggage has returned a week late.The moral of the story:  Cheaper is not already better.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/34/f0/15/kevin-f.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinfF2667XA,kevin f wrote a review Jul 2019,kevin f,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",16 contributions,34 helpful votes,London - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r687214140-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"RAM:  Avoid it, not worth the heart ache",Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have NEVER written a bad review!  As a travel agent, I think there is at least something good or acceptable about most service providers and I stay factual and balanced.  HOWEVER....my blood is boiling now!  I will NEVER fly nor book any client on Royal Air Maroc EVER AGAIN!!!!!  Under NO circumstances!!!!!  The level of services is reprehensible!!!!  When we (21 people) arrived in Marrakech, our bags (23 pieces of luggage) were not there.  No big deal; this has happened before. We went to the luggage office and they provided us a form with all of the luggage numbers and told us that they would call when the bags arrived.  Fast forward to day 3 and no calls, I decided to call the airline after using the app to track our luggage.  I explained that I had been trying to track the bags via the app and it looked like they never arrived in Casablanca (our layover).  The representative asked me for a reference number.  I gave them the number on the form.  They told me that that was not a reference number; that I should have obtained it from the rep at the airport; and without a reference number they could not help me.  The rep told me that I would just have to travel an hour to the airport to check on the bags. 🤬 So, I and another member of our group got a car, travel 1 hour to the airport and the bags had just arrived moments before we got there.  I checked the app and no change....the tracker still showed the bags had not reached Casablanca.  At the airport we learned that there was a luggage handler’s union strike and that was the cause of the delay.  After going thru security and customs several times to get 22 of the 23 bags on the van, we had to LITERALLY fight off the guys from wanting to assist us.  The problem was we had too many and needed to secure them while getting g them to the van.  If we had too many then we couldn’t manage if something happened.  Also, I didn’t have a bottomless pit to tip.  That was A MESS!!!!!Side note....the service on the plane was horrible too!  The seats were extremely uncomfortable; all flights were delayed but the boards always showed “on-time”; they are one of a few airlines that do not do TSA Pre-check; they have no co-share partners; the food was ok but it was like pulling teeth to get a soda or ice; etc!Back to the luggage...Now on the return...a member of the group returned to Miami from Marrakech.  1 of 4 bags didn’t make it.  The airline told them that the bag was still in Casablanca.  That was on June 24th!  As of today (July 5th) the bag still has not made it!  As of yesterday, the airline LITERALLY said “We don’t know where the bag is.”  To further add insult to injury, they said that they would have to wait 21 days for someone to call them and talk about reimbursement.  As a travel agent, this is GREATLY disappointing that my client had to deal with this disrespect and disregard for their property and overall customer experience!  Besides never patronizing this airline, I have learned that insurance is a real consideration when traveling and NEVER put ANYTHING of value in your checked luggage!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227jeromej,Jerome J wrote a review Jul 2019,Jerome J,,8 contributions,3 helpful votes,Washington DC - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r687051592-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Very Dissapointed,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"To begin, we should explain that we have never made a complaint or have never written a negative review about anything before.

We were meant to fly with royal Air maroc from Marrakech to London Heathrow via casablanca. When we arrived in Marrakech we were NOT informed that our flight to Casablanca was cancelled. They printed the wrong boarding passes for a flight that would take off after our connection from Casablanca and refused to believe that this was their mistake. Rude customer service from the get go, supervisor was sent for and would arrive in 'a few minutes', 45 minutes later she arrived but did not even come and speak to us. We asked again and were told we would be getting the bus to casablanca to get our flight. We explained we would not make the flight as it departed in 3.5 hours and the journey was 3 hours, but they assured us that the connection flight would be held for us. This turned out to be a blatant lie. The bus left with 3 hours to go until departure. Of course in Casablanca, the flights were not held so we were simply told 'your flight has left'. To add to this, none of the staff at casablanca had even been informed of the bus load of people coming to supposedly held planes to get us home. We were palmed off from person to person, via various closed royal air maroc agencies, until eventually a hotel was booked for us by yet another rude staff member. 24 hours later we boarded the next flight but even then the customer service left something to be desired. We will not be taking this airline again.

"I've flown with RAM a few times now and I've always had a fairly pleasant and good experience with them. The planes are nice and clean and also fairly new. The service provided by the airplane staff is great and they are very attentive to passengers.

The flights themselves have been very pleasant and the pilots are very professional when addressing passengers through the in-plane tannoy.

The food on the flight is average but what can you expect from an in-flight meal? Can't expect it to be 5 star Michelin chef cooking!

"This is one of the worst airlines I have ever traveled.  Flying from Dulles International to Marrakech through Cassablanca with this airline was the worst mistake of my life. I traveled with a friend.  Going to - we were delayed in Cassablanca without explanation for 2.5 hours. The flight attendants during the flight were rude and indifferent.  Trying to get additional water and coffee was a challenge.  I ate the free meal because I was starving but it was worse than hospital food.  The saving grace was the in-flight movie list.  Was able to watch a few great movies on the way. When we finally arrived in Marrakech, our check-in luggage did not arrive along with a few other passengers from the US.  Apparently, there was some kind of strike at the airline and airport with the workers so our luggage wasn't transferred during the delay.  Needless to say that we were without luggage for two days (thank goodness I packed emergency items in my carry-on).  We were finally able to retrieve our luggage from the airport after two days.   Returning home was a similar situation.  Coming from Marrakech to Cassablanca we already had an 8 hour layover.  So my friend and I toured around the airport and came back to our boarding area.  To add insult to injury, the flight was delayed 4 more hours while passengers stood around fumming with no explanation from the airline workers as to why there was a delay.  RAM didn't inform their workers of what was going on so they were unable to give any of the passenagers any information.   They kept delaying the flight and telling us they would provide us with an update in 30 minutes.. 45 minutes would pass and nothing... Folks were trying to get on their phones to find to find out when the flight would take off but couldn't get any good updates from the actual airline website.  Eventually there was speculation that another strike occurred and that the luggage from one flight got mixed with luggage for another flight to Miami so they had to switch back and then sent the Miami flight out first while our connecting flight to IAD went into limbo for 4 hours.  Once we finally were able to board and leave, same deal, service was poor and food was horrible.  At least for the flight home we got through customs seamlessly and our checked luggage arrived this time.  The other thing is with each flight transfer in Cassablanca, we had to be transported by a bus/tram to the planes and then walk up lots of stairs with carryon luggage in the heat to board the planes and down to get off.  For anyone with poor joints, you can only imagine that this was difficult. That was my first and last experience with RAM.  I will plan FAR IN ADVANCE to avoid taking this airline, I don't care how low their fares are going forward...",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/songbirda2018,Songbird AMLF wrote a review Jul 2019,Songbird AMLF,,7 contributions,1 helpful vote,Washington DC - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r686502567-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Delays without Explanations!,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Our tickets were inexplicably canceled on our final flight home. Had to stay a night in a hotel. Still do not have my luggage. An embarrassment of an airline that not only tarnishes the public image of Morocco, but of the airline industry as a whole.

"The title already says it all… but hey… I am going to let lose.

I must admit that this company does have competitive pricing, and for certain destination (especially within Morocco), the choices are limited. So… every now and then, I must fly this airline. So, yes… prices are decent.

Staying on a positive note, I must say that on most of the flight I have taken with this airline, staff on board are friendly enough. Nothing to write home about… but friendly enough is enough said.

Now we get to the bad… and this is the reason why I only chose this airline as a LAST choice, when nothing else is possible…

Planes (especially domestic flights) are old… REALLY OLD. Seats are uncomfortable, and in many cases, coming apart. Leg space is on the smaller side. Food options are very poor, I must say. I would just prefer a little warm cheese sandwich… rather than the meals they serve on flights under 2 hours.

Now worst of all is their “claim solving” division. They lost my suitcase in December last year, and I was told that I needed to wait 21 days to see if the suitcase would arrive. It didn’t… and will never turn up. I was travelling on business, so needed to buy clothes and toiletries for my 5 day stay in Morocco – again – ON BUSINESS. I kept the receipts, and 22 days later, I made a formal claim in writing. It took over a MONTH before I got a simple reply, asking for more details. I immediately answered (within 3 days), with every single detail informed – with copies of everything, from tickets to baggage tag… invoice copies and a valuation of what they lost.

I sent dozens and dozens of mails asking for information about my claim… NOTHING. I phoned every contact I could find to get information… NOTHING. On a recent trip to Agadir, I passed by the lost luggage, and threatened to take this to European Travel Agency… and I received their reply yesterday… 6 months and 7 days later. The offer they made me was about 50% of what I claimed…

Ridiculous in every sense of the word…

Again… I ONLY chose this airline, when there is nothing else.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trave1Bandit,Trave1Bandit wrote a review Jul 2019,Trave1Bandit,"Maia, Portugal",586 contributions,394 helpful votes,Porto - Dakhla,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r685646119-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,DECENT PRICES – OLD PLANES – LOST LUGGAGE,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If you must fly with Royal Air Maroc, travel with the knowledge that if they lose your luggage, there may not be anyone to assist you at the arrival airport and no clear way of how to address the matter. Now we understand why so many people were flying with 2-3 suitcases in the cabin. By the way I had to fly the entire flight with me and my wife's carry-ons on my lap because other passengers insisted on squeezing as much as possible into the overhead bins (we had fragile items in our bags and couldn't risk damage). In all due fairness, the flight attendants of Royal Air Maroc have to be some of the most patient in the business, as they had to manage copious belligerent passengers on this trip.
I am not sure that there is a good way to get to Cape Verde, nor any excuse to ever trust an airline such as Royal Air Maroc. All of our emails have been met with promises to get back to us with 30-60 days. The phone charges on our phones here in Cape Verde are $3.50 per minute/$19 per MB so as we are trying to find our luggage we are getting a rapidly increasing phone bill.
See our TripAdvisor profile, we do 250-400,000km a year.

"I flew from São Paulo to Cairo through Casablanca on June 23rd (last Sunday) and it was a Royal Air Maroc flight to Casablanca and an Egyptair flight from Casablanca to Cairo and I haven’t gotten my luggage yet (today is June 28th).
No one is able to tell me whether the problem was either on the way from São Paulo to Casablanca or from Casablanca to Cairo and I haven’t heard a single word from any of these airlines.
I had to buy some clothes and toiletries and was told by an Egyptair officer at Cairo International Airport that I have to wait up to 40 days to get reimbursed (they are supposed to contact me by email to get my credit card info to proceed with the reimbursement).

There was a salad of broccoli and some hard white tasteless stuff that no one could identify, and they did not provide my niece's vegetarian meal, saying that she had neglected to reconfirm when boarding.

Then we are supposed to be at airport back at 9 am, with no toothbrush, deodorant, care package, no food, no water, etc. Plane doesn’t leave until 2 pm. No one has responded as to who will cover the hotel night I lost. Then every flight we took was 1-2 hrs late from departure time.

"In 5 flights with Royal Air Maroc, departure is almost always delayed because of disorganized boarding and baggage loading. Delayed departures mean missed or tight connections and lost bags. Sometimes one is allowed 2 carry on bags and other times the agent is adamant about only one. This greatly reduces your protection when your or bags don't make connections.

Poor organization also continues in the air. On a recent 5 hour flight from Cairo to Casablanca, it took the cabin crew about 3 hours to distribute and clean up meal service on this single aisle aircraft.

Sometimes it is hard to avoid Royal Air Maroc, especially west and north Africa. But Turkish airlines services many of the same destinations, and it is a far superior carrier.

"Our recent trip to Morocco was fabulous, EXCEPT for our flights on Royal Air Maroc. The personnel at the ticket counters are unfriendly and provide no information. But the worst thing is boarding and debarking from their planes.  You have to walk to a bus, which takes you to many steps to get on the plane.  I witnessed a mother with a toddler and an infant in a carrier who was not helped or given priority boarding, so she struggled to get up the steps with much difficulty.  If you are disabled and need a cane, forget it.  This is NOT the airline for you.  Another problem:  Their website encourages you to print out your boarding pass, but when you get to the airport (we left from JFK and returned from Casablanca), you have to wait in line to get your boarding pass from an agent. Several people who had printed out boarding passes waited in security lines, only to be returned to the ticket counter of Air Maroc.  Their food is the worst I've ever experienced and of course, there is no alcohol on the airplanes.

"Wow, after many years of travelling a lot around the world I can easily say this was the WORST AIRLINE EVER.  what an awful experience, from check-in to disembarking.  The check in was painfully slow and disorganised.  was glad I wasn't a priority boarding ticket cause that line was even slower.  staff were not very helpful was only a few moments before boarding that I finally got to the front of the line, seemed every person checking in was in some kind of complications and staff were backwards and forwards... the plane itself had a shabby feeling about it but it was the toilets that were the worst, they were frankly disgustingly filthy, smelly and unhygienic.  the service was average at best and the food below average.Arriving in Casablanca for a stop-over was hideous experience.  from being shoved into an over crowded shuttle bus from the plane to then being dumped into a metal staircase leading up to a bridge that went into the airport. they had one security guy checking passports at the other end of the bridge which seems to go very very slowly, why they couldn't at least make space inside the airport was ridiculous.  inside the metal shed it was like an oven as was the enclosed bridge.  nobody explained anything there were no signs.  the airport itself was awful I think I showed my passport a total of 6 times in there and the staff were cold and uncaring, especially the security.  entering into the waiting area there were not enough seats and paltry shops and food options.  all I could do was pay $50 for the air morocco lounge which was strange and the food was poor and some of it been there fora long time but at least there was somewhere to rest and wifi that didn't work well.

"I booked my trip from Miami to Lisbon with a stop in Casablanca for a really price $450. I didn’t care to review the ratings of Royal sair Maroc because it was such a good deal and I always fly when I have a good deal and never had an issue before. If you are reading this review it is because either you are considering or you just booked a flight with them. If you are considering, it is not worth it! Pay a bit more and fly with a different airline. If you already booked it....I hope you have a better experience than mine.
We had a 1.5 hour lay over in Casablanca that turned into almost 7 hours. We didn’t know what was going on, all we heard were rumors but no communication was given from a member of the airline company. Everyone on the flight was demanding an explanation, we asked for a supervisor or manager and didn’t get any response. They left the poor ladies at the gate and they were clueless and helpless plus, they didn’t understand English and nobody on my flight spoke French or Arabic. The agony was unbearable. We didn’t know if we were going to stay in Casablanca for the night, we weren’t provided vouchers for our meal....nothing! To top it all, when we finally were let into the plane, there was no AC and we had to endure 1.5 fly in a sauna. The return flight was better but they still left 30 minutes late from Lisbon and then another hour delay in Casablanca. They employees are super disorganized and it left me wondering if the pilot knew what he was doing. Luckily, I’m here to tell the story and give my review.

"So, I actually missed my departure flight due to my flight with Norwegian being extremely later. Though I was initially told I would lose the entire ticket, they allowed me to keep my return flight and saved me hundreds of dollars.

If I had not experienced myself I would never believe what a nightmare this airline is. 24 hours of pure hell thanks to their cancelled flights(30 min prior to check-in) bus ride to Casablanca which of course made us miss our flight to London then 5 yes 5 hours of standing at the counter for someone to get us on another flight which they never did.

"Royal air Moroc is horrific! They not only stole our precious vacation time, sanity, energy — Royal Air Moroc as my husband and I attempted to fly from Casablanca to Paris on June 12, 2019 the airline RUINED OUR HONEYMOON. We were supposed to fly out on a 1:40PM flight and after sitting on the plane with no instruction just noise about a ‘technical’ problem hours went by. We finally left the aircraft only to be trapped on a bus when passengers lost their patience — protests, shouting horrific scenes of angry passengers banging on the glass because we were trapped on the bus. Still no apology, no explanation.... nothing. We finally left the airport at 10PM after zero help or guidance just dismissive air Moroc employees who are EXPERTS on having ZERO empathy, ZERO care, ZERO explanation they are good at literally turning their back towards us and running away. After literally running around the disorganized airport for ‘this stamp’ and ‘that ticket’ for a hotel for the night we almost missed our flight today since the bus that they arranged for our pickup decided to take a detour and pick up an airline flight attendant. As I sit on the back of the plane now, after being offered just FISH because the beef is OUT we finally hear an apology, “WE ARE SORRY ONLY FISH!” 😕 shame on this airline, their horrific customer service, their attitude, their complete lack of empathy, their unwillingness to assist elderly and screaming babies.

"Ruined our honeymoon to Paris. Had a flight from Casablanca to Paris. First plane didn’t work, we sat and taxied on the runway for about 90 minutes. Then we were going to get on a shuttle to another plane. We sat on the transport bus for another 30 minutes. People started yelling and knocking on the doors to get off. Another 15 minutes, and we were brought inside the terminal. We were stuck there for 5 or 6 hrs with no explanation or solution. Our flight was at 1:40pm, and we were all still there at 10pm. People were yelling, screaming, protesting. We were supposed to be off to a romantic suite in Paris. Our hotel in Paris said they couldn’t refund us the night. We had a tour booked for the Louvre this morning. Finally at 11pm, they drive us 40 minutes to the city center to stay at a hotel, and rebooked a flight at the same time today. They didn’t seem to care at all about our situation. Horrible. I hope we get to Paris today.

"Eventhough I'm Moroccan, I never trusted to flight with the Royal Air Morocco.However the only option for me from Abu Dhabi is to take Etihad Airways flight from UAE to Casablanca and then change it to Royal Air Morocco from Casablanca to Marrakech for only 1h20min flights.. This short time makes me only always ungry and frustrated (very very very bad service they don't care about costumers,no assistant or someone to ask if we need, no one is smiling and they keep asking from where your coming do you have some gifts for us....) the funny moment you might land in Casablanca airport and will find that all employees are not working,so once you reach you final destination you will never receive you luggages, why? Because Royal Air Maroc employees didn't care about you and your luggages and they decided to not put it on the airplane.

"The worst boarding process ever! The staff doesn't care if people line up in a proper queue or not. They don't make people line up according to their seat numbers. So imagine people sitting in the front, middle and back of the plane boarding altogether - chaos! This caused half hour delay. There were 4 buses taking people from the gate to the plane, but as I said, people randomly boarded the buses. And the craziest part is - although the first bus was full, it was still waiting for the other 3 to go. I am not sure if there is a rule saying that all buses must depart at the same time, but it was crazy. The 4 buses went together to the plane boarding area and they let everyone almost at the same moment. So it was like World War Z. It was the most unorganized thing I have ever seen.

"My wife and I flew with this airline for our morocco trip. To marrakech with a transfer in casablanca. So 4 flights in total. Not one of them departed in time. Minimum 2 hours of delay. To top that, there was also schedule change for 2 major flights. It was emailed to us but when we arrived at the airport all the screens were showing the old schedule and we were shocked. They did not even care to correct the screens in the airport.

It’s not over...

They lost our luggage in casablanca transfer and we waited for 2 hours for it to arrive in the next flight but we could retrieve it 2 days later. Called the customer support 10 times, nobody had any idea about where it was. I had to go to airport and ask everyone to find my luggage. They called me back 5 days later to see if I found my luggage or not. The trip was already over! On the return flight from marrakech to casablanca, our luggages were delayed for 1.5 hours. We contacted the customer support but they did nothing. Told us that there was a strike in the airport. I found some ground transportation guys by peeking through the curtains on the luggage belt to outside and asked them. Fortunately they found our luggage (90 mins after we started waiting for it.

In conclusion, avoid this airline if possible. Or else, be ready for delays and don’t check in any baggage.

"We arrived at our destination safely, which is most important, correct?

Even though we booked flights on the Fareness App four months in advance, we (two people) were assigned separate seats. Luckily we checked in early, we were able to change seats with the representative at the counter.

The flight attendants rarely shared a smile, especially given the length of the flight. I felt uncomfortable even asking for some water.

The cabin smelled funky. The restroom was dirty.

The food was awful. They served the same two items on four flights we had to take w/ long layovers in Casablanca, Morocco en route to Lisbon, Portugal.
Lesson learned: I will pay extra for direct flights🥴

None of the three USB ports were functional. If I was able to hold it just the correct way, it might have charged my smart phone. Thank goodness I didn’t require the ports for any devices, however.

They then proceeded to give hotel vouchers, but families had first priority.

"I was very skeptical to book with Royal Air Maroc after reading the reviews.  I took my chance book the flight because the other airlines were so expansive.  I was going to Lisbon, Portugal with a stop in Casablanca.  I flew to Casablanca without any problem.  Flight left on time from JFK, the service at the counter was smooth.  The service on the plane was outstanding, food and snack were very good.  In Casablanca to Portugal our flight was delayed for 2 hours.  I traveled a lot I wouldn’t have any problem with the delay if we were informed about the delay.  The sign stayed at the gate has the same departure flight time.  When questioning someone at customer service the answer was:  the plane is leaving soon.  Two hours later we got on the plane and had a short and wonderful trip to Portugal.  I received my luggage when I got off the planes in Portugal without any problems.  On the way back both planes were on time.  I received my suitcases at destination again.  The service at the counter in Portugal were superb.  The only problem I had was with the travelers, they don’t want to line up to wait for their turn to board, that’s not the Airline fault.  I will definitely traveled with Royal Air Maroc.

"We flew Royal Air Maroc on June 2, and our troubles began at the gate.  First, our departure was delayed by two hours but there was absolutely no communication about this while we waited--in fact, the screen at the gate still showed our original departure time even two hours later when we finally boarded, and the flight tracker on their website actually showed that we took off and landed on time.  Just before boarding, we were told by another passenger that the delay was due to an issue with the baggage handlers, but she only discovered this because she overheard an angry passenger questioning the airline staff person covering our gate desk--but no announcements were made to the group, just as with the departure delay.  When we arrived in Casablanca we discovered that NO ONE'S LUGGAGE had been loaded onto the plane--and we learned from Marrakech airport staff that this had been the case for all Royal Air Maroc flights arriving in the last two days!  Like other reviewers have posted below, we got the runaround when we tried to contact the airline to find out where our bag was, when it would arrive, and whether it would be shipped back to the U.S. if it didn't arrive soon (our flight home was just two days later).  We are seasoned travelers and completely understand that delays, weather, strikes, malfunctions, etc all happen from time to time--but the complete lack of communication by the airline (at check-in, at the gate, in the air, and via phone to customer service afterward) and what seemed to be an overall attitude of ""not my problem"" by the airline staff made the experience much more stressful than it needed to be.  We certainly won't be flying with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/7c/f9/94/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGirl322,TravelGirl322 wrote a review Jun 2019,TravelGirl322,"Pune, India",119 contributions,61 helpful votes,Casablanca - Marrakech,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r679495704-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,No luggage + No communication + Poor customer service = Unnecessarily stressful experience,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I see that a lot of travelers have had a bad experience with this airline, so I am not sure if my review will make a difference to the company, but I hope it makes a difference to travelers.
PLEASE DO NOT use this airline. I agree with everything everyone experienced- poor customer service, irresponsible, delayed flights, missing baggage.
I believe I was on the same flight as Sophiaz who left a review below, and agree with everything she says. We landed on Sunday night and still no news about our 3 bags that were checked in. This is not just my story, but is the story of more than 60% of the travelers. I mean- in which world does this happen? If the airport staff was on a strike- then they should be upfront and not put their customers through this grief.

When we call- they say ""call tomorrow"".
When we ask to speak to a supervisor- they say that the supervisor is not available due to Ramadan/ is not available at all/ available but cannot speak English. When asked when will supervisor be available, they say ""try tomorrow"".
They literally don't care.

"Arrived at airport more than 2 hours in advance. Tried kiosk check-in. Kiosk would not allow check-in for our flight - please see agent. Now, get in line with the 100 folks. Finally get to counter (30 mins) and agent says we have been ""bumped"" from flight. How? and Why? Royal Air Maroc allows for a 10% oversold. OK, makes sense, I am a multi-airline million miler, I get it, however, why am i not provided a boarding pass to complete my journey through security and customs? No Answer. I was now shuffled to supervisor, who informed me, my partner, and another SIX American travelers, we did not have seat assignments, and would have to wait until 59 minutes prior to departure for seats to be released, therefore providing upgrades to frequent travelers to business class and we would then get their seats. ABSURD! So, 8 Americans waited another 30 minutes to get seat assignments, providing us less than 50 minutes to venture through security, customs and get to our gate...this was a nightmare. If not for the plane being delayed 1.5 hours (never communicated to the passengers from anyone at the ticket counter of at the gate) we would have missed our flight. The title of my post is ""BEWARE - US Citizens Targeted"" because all of the people (8) who were not provided with seat assignments were American, coincidence? Doubtful. I don't believe coincidence comes around 8 times over. We were all tourist who were traveling with Royal Air Maroc on a single time basis, to fly from Africa to Europe and therefore we had no ""value"" to the Royal Air Maroc system.

"Literally the worst flying experience I have ever had I almost thought I was being punked. A connecting flight from Casablanca to JFK after originating in Marrakech, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have such a stressful experience home. To begin, we sat on the plane for 2 and a half hours before take off because the luggage workers were on strike so it was taking an extremely long time to load the plane. After 2 and a half hours of sitting on the Tarmak, an announcement is made in severely broken english that ""the hole is now closed, you will be leaving with no luggage"", a literal riot on the plane ensued. No further information was given, no representative came out to talk to the people, we just sat their and and freaked out. For 40 minutes the flight staff refused to speak to anyone, and people had absolutely no idea what was going on with their luggage. Then, the captain comes on the loudspeaker and says ""we are now taking off, also 40% of the bags made it on board"". Like what?!?!?! Who says that to a plane full of over a hundred people with no further explanation? What is this a social experiment? It was so unprofessional and downright rude. The staff treated us terribly and basically hid from the cabin so as not to deal with angry questions. THAT IS YOUR JOB. When we landed they gave no one information on how to collect their bags or what the next step would be. I was lucky to have had a connecting flight so my luggage made it on.

"Our flight booked originally was due to land back into LGW on Wednesday the 29th of May. We received notification that this flight was cancelled in advance, with no explanation and the only alternative we were offered was to spend 31 hours in Casablanca and then return to Heathrow on the 30th, instead of LGW. We accepted this change as we had no other choice. However, in doing so resulted in us losing extra money as we had already pre-paid for our travel from Gatwick back to home, and then had to fork out even more so to travel from Heathrow. We arrived at the airport on the 29th of May to fly to Casablanca on flight AT578 only to be informed our flight was delayed until further notice. We were sent to a hotel with no contact information or new flight details. During the day at the hotel no representatives of RAM were present nor did they provide any information to hotel reception. It was only by luck we were passing through reception to be told our bus was on its way and to collect our bags quickly, resulting in us nearly missing the bus, and in consequence our flight because of very poor communication skills from RAM.

When finally arriving into CMN at 01:00am we had to wait 90 minutes for ground staff to come to the transit and lodging office, then a further 25 minutes before we were given a hotel room for the night.

We were then at the airport at 10:00am on Thursday the 30th for flight AT800 to LHR, we checked our bags in and collected our boarding passes, cleared security and attempted to board the plane only to be told there was a change to our booking and we were now flying the following day. I had no prior notification to this and the ground staff were extremely unhelpful, offering no explanation as to why and making out as if it was a fault of our own which it most definitely was not. Your ground staff were incredibly rude, nobody willing to take the blame sending us round in circles for 2 hours before we even had a slight idea as to what was happening. Nobody knew were our luggage was, your baggage services team told us it had left on the AT800 without us, which is a major security risk, check in staff were saying it was still in the airport but they didn’t know where, the transit staff didn’t want to help at all. So with no luggage we were left in Morocco with nothing but the clothes on our back.

We arrived back into LGW on the AT802 on 31/05/19, two days LATER than planned, out of pocket for having to spend money that could have been prevented by yourselves, only to be standing around the baggage carousel to find out our luggage hasn’t arrived. One of our bags in still in Casablanca and the other bag can’t be traced. There is a substantial amount of value in those cases and we were promised that those bags were on our flight this morning by YOUR check in agents.

So not only was our original flight to LGW cancelled and altered to LHR a day later, we were stuck in BJL with no communication from your staff as to what was happening other than 1 email saying the delay duration was unknown. You then changed our flights to LHR whilst we were in the departure lounge, extending our stay for an extra day. Our checked luggage was tagged for LHR but we ended up flying to LGW. All in you have cost us 2 days wages at work, extra spending costs in Morocco, pointless train tickets as we then couldn’t use any we had previously purchased and no luggage to be seen. There hasn’t been a single member of staff who has apologised for all the inconvenience you have caused us, and we have spoken to at least 20 members.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophielfinn,sophielfinn wrote a review May 2019,sophielfinn,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",2 contributions,6 helpful votes,London - Banjul,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r677845792-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Horrific Service,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Any concern previously generated in order to fly by Air Maroc was just changed for a sequence of wow moments.

The airplane: 787 Dreamliner. Modern. Huge. A very tasteful catering. Much more generous than well know US companies.

They provided accommodation for 1 night, shuttle transfer and meals for 1 night as my connections took more than 8 hours. Easy and very friendly at Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport.

"I write this review not to disrespect, escalate racial diversity or even to tarnish the image of this company, rather want to push for a proper training of personal and learn to discipline them.

For some reasons, my connecting flight from Casablanca to Moscow was canceled a day before my trip.😲🤷🏾‍♂️
⠀

I arrived the airport and went to the accommodation department at the airport to get accommodation voucher, cos i could not hang-out in the airport for two nights!
⠀
I have meet some Africans 🤷🏾‍♂️ that were stuck in the airport lobby for 2 DAYS!!, 😭😭🤯😱 because thier flight was cancelled and they where not provided accommodation due to the fact they are AFRICANS (black Africans) that may want to over stay the transit grace in Morocco !!! That is so crazy !!!!🤬🤬
⠀
So back to my horrible story ! 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
I meet a young man ( who never introduced him self) and i asked for voucher
He told me that I did not pay for my flight and I have no flight to Moscow.
⠀

I tried to explain to him that there must be a mistake! it can't be that i don't have a flight.
I just flew from Lagos to Casablanca !
⠀

He kept on insisting that i don't have a ticket and that he can't do anything to help and that I should leave his office.
⠀

At this moment, he started acting rude and raising his voice, because i told him there is a mistake, it can't be that I don't have a ticket.
⠀
I showed him my payment receipt, but he ignored me and started speaking to someone else in Arabic neglecting my presence.
⠀

I asked, what next to do, and He said i should go to the agent and fix it. ( Talking off his shoulders)
⠀

I told him that i will report to the administration about his bad and unprofessional manner of communication, of which he answered, that I can do whatever i want and go to where ever I want and he does not care! Literally telling me off. 🤯

I felt racially discriminated of both colour of skin and because I did not speak Arabic. I could tell from the way he attended to some white Arabian who walked up to interrupt us. I told him to please finish talking to me before switching to another costumer, but to no avail.
⠀

I got a confirmation from the agent and a prove that my flight was cancelled late, a day before the scheduled departure .(Not by me but by the company, because they could not Provide a flight on the scheduled day they sold me the ticket 🎫 )
⠀

I went back to him to get my accommodation ( cos could not hang around the airport for 2 DAYS)
⠀
I told him to give me his name so I can lay my complaint and dissatisfaction of this particular employee and He refused to disclose his identity.
⠀
After i managed to take a picture of him, he threatened he will call the police to arrest me.
⠀
A different personal ( I think his boss) came and then gave me the voucher for accommodation.
⠀

I asked for the identity of that particular Personal, but He said i should just forget it.
⠀

I made it known that i will post this online if i did not get a personal apology from that personal.
⠀
He now told me that I will get into trouble and arrested !!!!!
⠀
I told him what had happened and he did not even confirm from that personal what exactly happened !!
⠀
How can you trust a company that does not in anyway respect ✊ their clients ?
⠀
So if you want to be insulted, racially discriminated, unscheduled flight cancelation, then this company is the best you can count on.
⠀
I hope this will fall to attentive ears and we all will learn to make people step up, get educated and learn to communicate with respect, gratitude and improved customers services.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926abdullahiy,Abdullahi Y wrote a review May 2019,Abdullahi Y,"Candler, Florida",2 contributions,3 helpful votes,Casablanca - Moscow,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r675563027-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,NEVER FLY AIR MAROC 🇲🇦.

"My sister and I traveled from IAD to FCO with layover each way of the round trip through Casablanca CMN. First leg of our trip went as planned and all went well. Easy check in and a comfy night flight with good food and service from all attendants. Unfortunately the return trip was a disaster. Our FCO flight was delayed 4 hours- our connection in CMN missed to IAD. We were sent back and forth to different office to collect our luggage, get help for a new flight and obtain accommodations for the night. No one was helpful, no one was kind. Only after threats were we allowed to get our luggage except my sister's bag was lost. The tracker stated it was at CMN. CMN couldn't find it. Had to threaten in order to get placed on another carrier since another RAM flight to IAD would be in 3 days. After about 4 hours at the airport, we were finally given flights with Air Canada. Our hotel was a place to sleep, but was as expected based on poor treatment and service at the airport. My sister's bag is still lost and no one has helped her. Even Air Canada opened a case to help and they never touched her bag. Shameful. I will not travel with RAM again. I do not recommend the airline. I don't even want to travel to Morrocco again.

"It is a three hour flight in the middle of the night, so nobody is going to enjoy it, but the cabin staff were among the grumpiest I have ever seen in Africa. Perhaps they disapproved of me drinking in Ramadan, but all I wanted was a quick couple of glasses of wine to go to sleep - not the full meal service they were trying to give everyone at 2 in the morning! Seats were OK - hard to sleep in (didn't recline very far), but nice and wide and plenty of leg-room. Arrived in Casablanca and spent almost an hour locating the hotel room which they offer to people with over eight hours' stop-over, only to discover it was a horrible, smelly, hole-in-the-ground room that nobody except the truly desperate would use.

We flew back to London after a vacation in Morocco which was great but this airline is one of the worst we have ever flown on. We had seats booked near the rear of the plane as that was all that was available when we booked. When we tried to check in online it wouldn’t let us. When we got to the airport we asked about upgrading to business class. We were told that we would first have to check in so we did. We then went to the counter to tag our luggage and asked about upgrading and what it would cost. They had no idea how to check or do this and told us to go to a different counter. We did that and we were told that we couldn’t upgrade as we had already checked in!! We told them that we were told to do that but they didn’t care. We therefore sat in our assigned seats which had the least amount of legroom we have ever encountered. We also noticed that there were empty seats in business class that we would have paid for so the airline lost revenue as a result.

"I was initially a bit nervous about this airline because I hadn’t heard of it and because I had seen a decent amount of negative reviews. However, at least in my experience, all of these concerns were unfounded. I had a wonderful trip with this airline and they had top-notch customer service. Plus, it was at least $300 cheaper than other flights - including other non-direct flights. The departures were orderly and on-time. There were no luggage issues.

In both stations, we had agents who had no sense of urgency, time management, communication skills with customer and basic empathy.

"My name is Ahmed Kamel Fahmy I was traveling in a Multi City round trip with Royal Air Maroc from Cairo to Lisbon through Casablanca on the 12th of April and my Return flight was on 21 from Madrid to Cairo through Casablanca also
First my transit flight was delayed for more than two hours at Mohamed V airport and an extra hour on the plan until taking off which ruined my first day in Lisbon without reasonable explanation and every time I ask the gate flight attendant for the delay reason she replay with an unreasonable answer like the plan is still under cleaning then they sent me an Apology email saying admiting so.

The major problem was with my flight back home i went to the airport early as I received an email from Iberia stating that the airport security are having a strike so to finish on time i need to be there early i checked in my bag and finished everything but I didn’t know my gate they announce at Madrid Airport that we have to check the boards every now and then because they don’t announce gates or changed flights i checked and i went to my gate and when boarding time come i went to check in to find that im at the wrong gate and that my flight is not Royal Air Maroc but Royal Air Maroc operated by Iberia i went to the other gate and the flight was already gone so i went to the customer service to tell me that they can do nothing for me i have to contact Royal Air maroc which have the worst callcenter line that is very hard to reach and the hot keys always don’t comply with the choice they told me after so many attempts and lot of roaming calls about 200 euros international calls to your call center only that they will rebook me on the next flight to Casablanca and then the next transit flight back home to cairo and that they will book me an hotel as the flight to cairo will be the next morning but first i need to be cancelled from cairo flight which they cant help me with as it is operated by EGYPTAIR not Royal Air Maroc i wasn’t able to reach them and badly lost in Madrid Airport i ask about my Luggage to find that it Boarded the plan and on its way to Cairo thorough Casablanca without me on the plan wish is a major security breach i had to wait for the flight from Casablanca to cairo to takeoff to be able to Rebook which also was delayed an hour from taking off at its original time i called the call center again and he told me that he will rebook me at the next flight to casablanca then the next morning to cairo but i have to pay 201 Euros as a penalty and there will be ni hotel for me it will be on me desperately i accept as my visa was going to expire in two days and my bag was boarded to cairo and me and my family back home were in panic to get to the next problem that he booked me the flight but i cant pay the penalty through the call center i had to pay it at Royal Air Maroc office at Madrid Airport i went there to pay to find the girl there barley speaking english with no experience telling me that she will not be able to take the penalty money from me and give me a flight number to travel back home she only make new booking even though she had my ticket on her system and i have to do it though the call center which refused telling me that he only take penalty money 48 hours before flights i spent more than two hours begging the girl in the office or the call center to take the money and let me go home with both of them refusing after losing a lot of money time and effort i decided to get back to madrid book the next day flight on my Home Airline EGYPTAIR and go home to find that my bag is still in Casablanca at the Iberia storage I field a case and EGYPTAIR operated it very professionally to receive my bag 5 Days Later on the 26 of April 2019.

"This was our first and last time flying Royal Air Maroc. We left JFK the evening of 4/22/19 with a connection in Casablanca to Marrakech. When our luggage didn't arrive on the carousel, we got in the very long line at the claims desk, but were told nothing. The next two days we went to the airport morning and night in hopes that our luggage was among the luggage that was piled in a few corners near the claims desk...no luck. However, we did hear from others that the baggage handlers in Casablanca went on strike 4/21/19. On the third night, we waited for the last flight to arrive from Casablanca (11:30pm) and was told by an airport employee that more luggage was arriving, the strike was over. Our luggage finally arrived at 2:14am 4/26/19, 2.5 days after our arrival. The name/luaage tags were torn off all of the arriving luggage and we walked around like everyone else hoping to spot our luggage, which we did. There was no system, no scanning, no monitoring. People simply walked up the luggage and picked-up a piece. We were so lucky that the people looking for their luggage were honest. It is now 5/7/19 and we haven't received any notification, but we have our luggage. Based on other reviews, this is not uncommon. It was my first and last time traveling Royal Air Maroc, My husband and I paid for extra leg room, aisle seat but when the time was changed by 10 minutes they changed our seats to the very last row, with no explanation or compensation.

"Flight attendants (2 males) were the worst I have ever experienced and I do a lot of international travel.  They served a meal with a cup for a hot beverage and told passengers they would be separately serving the coffee/tea.  They came around with tea but when asked for coffee said that would be forthcoming.  After more than an hour of wait (and my traveling companion is someone who needs her coffee!) my companion went to the back of the plane and demanded coffee which they gave her.  I continued to patiently wait for them to serve, but eventually went back to seek coffee myself. One attendant was asleep and the other playing on his electronic device  I was told they had no more coffee!  And they tried to say they had come through with coffee service, which was just a boldfaced lie. When I expressed outrage one attendant found and brought me some coffee. The other folks around me then started clamoring for coffee (they too had been patiently waiting), and were told there was no more. One other point to add is that during the entire flight (over 5 hours), the attendants never responded to the call buttons - they would just ignore them and then turn them off from the back of the plane!Incidentally, Royal Air Maroc does not actually want customer feedback.  My friend and I were anxious to give our feedback after the flight, but the survey link that the airline sent us never worked.

"I had flight from Cairo to Santiago de Chile with layovers in Casablanca and Barcelona. They didn't let m check in and kicked me out of the airport and I have never heard a word from them after all of my complaints. There have no thing such as customer care. They are robbery not an airline.
Detail:
The check in staffs didn't let me check in with the reason as a Vietnamese I need transit visa for Spain. I had a carry on bag only, boarding pass from Barcelona - Santiago de chile printed, layovers is less than 24 hours and both arriving and deoarting flight from the same terminal (terminal 1) and I did not intend to leave the internationl transit area. As I confirmed with the Embassy of Spain in Vietnam by email, I DO NOT need a transit visa for Spain if I don't leave the international transit area. It is also written on the official website of the Embassy of Spain. And the Vietnamese embassy in Cairo confirmed with me once more. I attached the screenshot of the website and the email. In their website aslo written that ""passenger can transit with out visa through Barcelona and Madrid arriving from a non-Schengen member State with a confirmed onward ticket and travel to a non-Schengen member State

Therefore I got denide boarding wrongfully by Royal air Maroc.

After that, they wrote a paper and send a person to escort me through security gate. I followed him, didn't know that they are sending me out of the airport. At the security gate, I refuse to leave.

"We had bought a direct flight from Casablanca to CPH.
The departure was changes twice, and when we had to go the plane was overbooked, so we couldn't travel.
it took us 6 hours before we at a minimum got a hotel to the day after, and a new flight.
The personal was NOT serviceminded at all, and we had to call the manager who didnot care to show up. Nothing happend in those 6 hours, and we didnøt even got a bottle of water and we had to flex from the checkin to the office - back and forth because nobody took the responsability to help os.

We could easily find new flights on the internet with depature on the same day, but they didnot want to use surgestions at all and kept delaying ANY form for solutions.

At last we got a flight of 13 hours to go home - 24 hours after the original flight (which was 4,5 hours direct flight)

I really do not understand how a firm can be so indifferent and not serviceminded at all. Im horrified that this can happen in 2019. Never have I seen such bad behavior to customers acctually having payed for a flight and not even get the obligated service to help to solve the problem ...

Who in the world turns the back on you when you ask for help - or water ...

Never EVER would I use Royal Air Maroc.

I really hope we get the obligated compensation for getting back to CPH 24 hours later than planned ....

"On paper, Royal Air Maroc sounds great with luggage and a meal included in the airfare. However, the good things seemed to end right there.

A group of us are travelling to Marrakech from Milan airport. The MXP - CMN sector was fine, there was a hot meal included and our luggage was checked in straight for Marrakech airport.

At Casablanca airport however, it is where the airline failed to deliver on the fundamentals. The boarding procedures were messy. Screens were not updated and boarding agents are sometimes unsure of what flights are boarding or not. We had to figure out if our flight, AT413 is boarding or not at one of the gates.

Our flight was also delayed by about 45 minutes.

On arrival at Marrakech, there was no assistance or information provided as to what to do or what happened to the delayed luggage. The baggage claim counter was overwhelmed by passengers from our flight and other flights and the online baggage tracker was outdated.

Eventually, the unhappy crowd at the baggage claim managed to come up with a form in which we filled up our luggage details and lodging to be submitted to the counter.

We left the airport without our luggage and tried our luck again that evening to get some information at the airport as there was no updates or notification from the airline about the luggage. Eventually, we found our luggage outside the baggage claim and it took us a while to get them to indicate the time of collection.

An email inquiry we sent out on 22nd April was eventually answered to on 2nd May. The airline apologized, said it was due to customs officers strike and gave a list of instructions on what to do and denied responsibility for what has happened.

I have experienced delays and delayed luggage incidents before with other airlines. In those cases, there was information and assistance provided on what to do next on-ground and online: solutions. Unfortunately, Royal Air Maroc seemed more concerned about denying responsibility was what that convinced me to give it 1/5 rating instead of a 3/5 (because the MXP - CMN flight was actually okay). The airline seemed to not get it that all we wanted is information, solutions and updates when such things happened.

Royal Air Maroc uses RAM Handling as their baggage handler, most other airlines such as Lufthansa, Ryanair and Vueling at RAK uses Swissport which has a better reputation.

As such, I strongly advise getting another airline with a more reliable baggage handler. This airline didn't get its priorities right. If nothing bad happens then it is good, if it does, you are pretty much left in the lurch like the many passengers we encountered at RAK with their missing and delayed luggage.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/e4/e5/bc/xinli29288.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xinli29288,xinli29288 wrote a review May 2019,xinli29288,"Singapore, Singapore",521 contributions,108 helpful votes,Milan - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r671978930-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Did Not Get the Fundamentals of an Airline Right,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were supposed to travel home from Casablanca(Marocco) to Copenhagen(Denmark) with direct flight.
Got an email 10 hours before departure that my flight was cancelled and i was rebooked to another flight with transit in Berlin.
When we arrived at the airport we were told we didnt have seats due to overbooking.
For 6 hours we were stranded in the airport. The company refused to book another flight to europe, even thought there were plenty of available flight to airports with connections to Denmark.
We asked for water and food but the airline refuses to give us anything.
We asked to talk to the manager, but the manager refused to speak to us / show up.
After 6 hours we were put into a bus and send to the nearby hotel. Got a voucher for a crap-meal.
The day after we spend 13 hours on travelling because the airline send us to Turkey for a connection to Denmark. Our original booking was a direct flight of 4,5 hours.
So far we haven’t seen any kind of compensation.
We came to Marocco with Norwegian. Norwegians tickets were much cheaper but had much better service.
I will never ever travel with Royal Air Maroc again.

Worst airline ever... (some low cost airline are better than this) They lost my luggage and was only able to locate my lost luggage after 10 days. Above all they were not able to send it directly to my home because they're too cheap to pay shipping. I needed to pick my luggage by myself at the airport.

"If you are looking for expert customer service, and attention to detail you will not find it with this airline. Only book this airline if you like being lied to, being laughed at and being told some how it is your fault.

First they left my bag in Geneva even though I was assured it was on flight AT933 to Casablanca. I even asked the women at the desk before i boarded. She checked the system and assured me it was there.
I get to Casablanca and the reception for baggage is rude and put the wrong description for my bag. I was leaving for Fez the next day so I could not wait for them.
I called multiple times to ask them to transfer my bag to Fez. They said no worries, it would be one the plane on the next flight.
Called to follow up, then was told it was not on the flight to Fez, but in Casablanca.
So I told them to leave it in Casablanca and I would come get it on the 28th of April when I was coming back to go home.

On the 28th of April I went to the baggage area. THEY SENT IT TO FEZ!! Even though I specifically told them not to.

Now I am back home waiting... Still waiting... Still no update. I have call Several times, asked them to send it back home to Canada. The last conversation I had with them was about 7 minutes ago. I do not trust that this woman I spoke with actually sent an email to get my back home.

"Royal Air Maroc, was all round pathetic.

We had a flight booked from Marrakech to Dubai via Casablanca.
It had a 90 minute lay over in Casablanca. Then the flight changed with a 20min layover, which I thought was not enough time to make it to my transfer.
I spoke to the staff at Royal Air Maroc 27 Hours before my flight at the airport trying to explain the situation and they just said “it’s ok” “it’s ok”. How can a staff member think that, that is ok, even worse I went to the supervisor and they said the same thing. (see photos for flight times on tickets)

Then our flight was delayed (surprise surprise) Landed in Casablanca, and the gates where closed and we missed our flight.
No one could help, I can’t explain how lazy, unhelpful and un professional the staff of Royal Air Maroc are.

We tried to speak to someone who could help. No one would help us. Spoke to staff at the counter and they just looked at me blankly and said “10mins”. 30 minutes later, nothing, 60 minutes later, nothing. This man at the counter was Hassin Ismail. He told me he would call when the supervisor came.
I man arrived at the counter, sat there for 20mins, I then went up and spoke to the new staff member, he was the supervisor. Hassin Ismail, did not even bother to tell me, whilst I stood in front of him all that time waiting.
Seriously don’t understand how the staff can be so incompetent.

After a long 5 hours, we got a new flight the next day via Paris! We where told to get our bags to go to our hotel, went to the counter and they said they can’t get our bags at the baggage handlers. Then spoke to another assist in the transit office, and she said it will take 2 hours to get our bags, the bus to our hotel was leaving in 15 minutes that they organised for us.

Then our hotel was a 70 minute Drive away from the airport. Which was not a safe feeling drive, with the driver going 120km/h in a 60km zone as well as constantly speaking on his mobile phone. (see photos attached)

Other people had similar problems with their flights and they where on the bus with us and had been dropped of at 5 star hotels (locals) whilst we where we given a dingy hotel in a side alley.
In this hotel, they served us a set Royal Air Maroc set menu, without telling us what it was and asking for any allergies or dietary requirements and no drinks provided. They said breakfast was provided, which we did not get from the hotel, they said ti was to early.

Then was told to wait downstairs at 4am for 4:45am pick up. I asked why wait so long, they said don’t know when the driver will come.

Went to the main counter of Air Maroc which was supposed to open at 6am, did not open till 6:15am, they staff that was supposed to be there to open was sitting in the coffee shop across having coffee and chatting with a colleague (see attached photo) while we had 4 other customers where waiting outside the door.
We asked for our breakfast voucher and he then sent us to an area that was closed, and I said it was closed and he just said I cant do anything. No one takes responsibility or helps you with Royal Air Maroc, why bother having staff like that.

They did not give us a boarding pass to our connecting flight from Paris, so we had to go there to get one, with no baggage tickets. Go to Paris and we had 60 mins to get of the plane, clear customs, catch a train 5 stops to another terminal, find our check in counter to explain our situation and get our tickets. We just made that flight.

My food on the plane was frozen (see photo attached)

Arrived in Dubai and our bags where lost.
It took 5 days to receive our bags. We where stuck in Dubai with know luggage and only received our bags when we went back to Sydney. After 2 days and 8 calls, I got through to someone at Royal Air Maroc asking if we can get remuneration for cosmetics and clothes we had to buy, and they HUNG UP!

Tried to contact Royal Air Morroc for remunerations and explanations for everything, via email and they said we will get back to you within 60 Days!

There is a lot more, but it is not worth going on.

"On April 9th,2019 I flew from Casablanca to New York,flight #AT 200. I purchased my Airline ticket, over 2 month ahead of time, through Orbitz, and selected my seat. About a month later, or so, I received an Email from Royal Air Maroc, saying that they changed my plane. I went on line to check for my seat, but I found it all gone, and not replaced. I contacted a Royal Air Maroc Agency in Essaouira, Morocco. The agent informed me, that I don't have any seat assigned. He then, assigned me a seat all the way in the back. I wasn't happy with that!!!
Came April 9th, at the Airport, my boarding pass says ""Group C."" We were lined up according to our groups, A,B,C, etc... for more than an hour. Elderly women and men were so tired, that they sat on the floor and read their books. A middle aged man started to talk loudly complaining about this situation, and no Royal Air Maroc representative came forward to explain, or apologize to their passengers. Half an hour later, they let us in our plane, but not in groups order, like we were assigned in our passes. Up in the air, the pilot announced, that he was sorry for the long delay, that was beyond their control. While we were flying, about midway, I was very thirsty, and since I had a window seat, I didn't want to disturb an elder lady next to me, so I touched, on my TV screen the sign of the crew member, to request a cup of water, but no one responded. I repeated the same request every now and then 11 times, but no one ever came to check on what I want. Anyway, I ended up by going to the back of the plane, and there were 3 flight attendants seating and busy on their cell phones, playing games, or looking at their photos. I mentioned to them that I could've been dead of thirst in my seat, despite the fact that I rang their bell so many times. One of them said, they respond to those bells, because people play with them, and I was told to help myself with the water bottle. This was embarrassing and ridiculous. I wish that, the Royal Air Maroc was better managed.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammede758,Mohammed E wrote a review May 2019,Mohammed E,New Jersey,38 contributions,7 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r670630940-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Lack of supervision,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight was delayed for a few hours because a person had gotten sick. They took her off the plane and they also had to take her luggage off. To take her luggage off, they had to take some other people’s luggage off. But because of the Porter Strike, the rest of the luggage was not put back on the plane. When we reached Dulles from Casa Blanca I waited an hour for my luggage, but found it did not come. Over half of the people on the flight were missing their luggage. Unfortunately, I was one of those unlucky souls who were missing their belongings. I had come to Maryland to see my sister who was in the hospital and spend time with her, but I had to spend time searching for my luggage. I went a week without clothing or my personal items. I tried to find my luggage by calling customer service, but they kept asking for a claim number that we were not given. Days later, I went back to the airport to retrieve my luggage with my nieces because I had heard that it would be coming in on that day’s flight. When we got the luggage we realized that it was drenched with water and was soaking wet. All of the items in my suitcase were ruined. Other people also got their suitcases back. Some suitcases were ripped open, others had rust on them, some of the locks were broken, and most were drenched with rain. I assume that our suitcases had been out in the rain for multiple days hence the rust. What made it worse was that I brought wedding clothes for my niece’s wedding in my suitcases. I had also sewn a suit for my mother. The clothes were completely wet and wrinkled. My hard work and money had gone to waste. We managed to salvage a few pieces of clothing. We also made a claim, but have not received anything in response. I strongly recommend that you not take this airline if you don’t want to have to deal with the many inconveniences that come with traveling with this airline. There is poor communication with passengers and many problems with finding luggage. I definitely will not be traveling with this airline again. I had bought my ticket on short notice as I had a family emergency.

"I travelled last week to Casablanca from NY's JFK airport.  Our flight was delayed by 45 minutes, but were told we were still on time.  By the time we dealt with the disorganized, chaotic boarding, we were already past our scheduled departure time.  The flight itself was just as disorganized as the boarding.  My entire row was skipped during the dinner and drink service.  I finally got some water after 5 hours of flying.  I sent a whatsapp message as well as an email to customer service.  When 2 days passed and I hadn't heard back, I called customer service only to be given an attitude and told there is nothing they can do.  I was concerned that this would happen again on my return flight.  When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was put on hold for 15 minutes (it was 4:50pm when I was initially placed on hold) and when the person came back on the line I was told that the supervisors finish for the day at 5, so I'd have to call back tomorrow.  This is the WORST airline I have ever flown and DO NOT recommend that others have to deal with the same aggravation.  In retrospect, I should have paid a little more money and travelled with a reputable airline.  The service on board made easy jet, ryan air, and other low cost carriers look luxurious!

She sat us together very close to the fruit the economy section which was fantastic. We were then served an excellent dinner, with free smaller bottles of wine & a second one when I asked!

"We booked this airline to and from Casablanca for its convenience. The airline seats are well spaced and comfortable. The plane was fairly new as well. The check-in process was painless and we took off on time.

The first meal served was really delicious. After that they served nothing until just before we landed.

Whoever assigns seats needs to be better trained. My hubby and I had selected a window and an aisle seat with a vacant seat between us hoping it would stay vacant. The flight was not full, yet a gentleman connecting from a neighboring country was assigned the middle seat. There was a vacant aisle seat right next to my husband!

The seat right in front of my husband was occupied by a large older man who smelled just awful. His wife had a window and there was a young girl between them (not related to them). We could smell him three rows behind and three rows in front. I cannot imagine how that poor girl endured 7 1/2 hours of that smell.

Flight attendants were not very attentive. Towards the end we had some trash to dispose of and asked one of them to take it. He said to put it in the seatback pocket!

That should explain my rating of 6.

Finally after 10 horrible hours we reached our home airport and after our immigration, we went to the baggage collection area. Waited waited and waited over an hour for our bags to arrive & after 1 hour an agent(Royal Air Morac) came to inform us that our bags were never loaded onto the flight due to porter strike and will arrive in the next flight which is after 3 days.
We were asked to fill a form saying our bags did not arrive and the airline refused to give us any proof or claim ticket saying our bags were delayed.
3 days later received a call finally from the airline representative to tell us that our bags are not coming in that days flight as well.
Now I don't know when I will get my bags and I don't even have a claim ticket that says my bags did not arrive. Neither did the Airline ever spoke about the compensations or give us anything as the law requires.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlackH546,Black H wrote a review Apr 2019,Black H,"Ashburn, Virginia",23 contributions,21 helpful votes,Casablanca - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r669018009-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst Flight Experience EVER,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"plane arrived late at casablanca and was not cleaned.  they had everyone lined up standing for 1hr before boarding.... no communication.  we board... they tell us the baggage handlers are on strike and we wait another hr.  some elderly person gets sick and faints (due to low blood sugar from standing in a line for 1 hr to board).  they are removed from the flight and their baggage is removed (wait another hr).  We finally takeoff after 2 hrs in the plane. we arrive at IAD.  wait for 30 mins at luggage.  half the passengers are missing bags.

It was very difficult to understand the announcements in English; the speaker's accent was quite heavy so it was hard to make out what she was saying, and the sound system wasn't that great, so she sounded muffled and spoke very fast.

We sat there for an hour and a half before we were finally told to leave the plane while they fixed the problem. Of course they didn’t fix the problem but rather suggested that we take the plane to Casablanca (another city in Morocco), fix the plane there then either fly in it to Paris or take another plane there. Yes, get on the plane with the technical problem and fly in it in order to get it fixed before flying to our actual destination.

"This was honestly the worst airline I have ever flown with. First the flight from Venice to Casablanca was delayed. We arrived to Casablanca late, there was a very long line at security for my connection flight to New York. I informed your representative that it was 10 minutes before boarding, he wouldn't let me get ahead of the line and said don't worry they won't leave you. We were on the line for almost 1 hour. We arrived to our gate and the Aircraft was taxiing out of the gate. No one is around had to find the information desk, then my family (son 8 months old, daughter 6 years old, and wife) and I had to walk all over the airport to coordinate rebooking and hotel. At rebooking we waited 1 hour because so many people missed their flights, to have Air Maroc to book our hotel was even worse. We waited 4 hours between getting our hotel booked, waiting on transportation, being bused to the hotel (which was a 2 hour ride between dropping 1 group of people off before us). By the time everything was all said and done, it was a 6 hour process from when we landed in Casablanca and we got to our hotel room. Next day, I realized they put down 14:00 pick up from the hotel. I called the Airline to tell them we need to get picked up earlier. Our flight departs at 16:20 and boarding starts15:35. To make that would be impossible it takes 45 min from our hotel to the airport, we still would have to go through security, and customs. I informed the operator and they said they didnt have any information for me. So I asked them to transfer me to the appropriate people. She said the person who booked my hotel and pick up knows what they're doing and to trust them. I heard that before from them and obviously that didnt work. Then she hung up on me because she said I was being rude after I patiently explained 3 times the situation and I lost my patience.  Customer service is terrible the only helpful people and what help me not stress out was the front desk at Hotel Golden Tulip Farah Casa. They tirelessly called after for me and made sure we were picked up at 13:00.

"I have never in my life experienced an air line as disgusting, negligent and with the poorest customer service such as this one. Royal Air Maroc not only failed to keep customers updated when sever delays caused our flight to be cancelled. There is next to no presence of actual staff on hand at airports to offer support and service. Agents in customer service are completely incompetent with no clue of what is happening on the ground.

The airline lacks organisation and proper etiquette, I wouldn't fly with them if they were giving away tickets for free. My family who flew with them the day after my initial flight was stranded in Casablanca for 24 hours and on arrival to Lagos, all eight pieces of luggage was missing for 2 days. The airline did not compensate or make right their awful error.

"After a 7 hour wait for connection, was told 15 mins delay. Waited at gate for ages, business boarding line not obvious. Once on plane, waited and waited - apparently for connecting passengers. However, when I spoke to the crew re the delay, they said there was nothing they could do. When I asked a member of the flight crew if he would arrange to call forward and tell LHR of my late arrival, he ignored me! Later, the purser said he would speak to the flight crew when I reminded him, but only sent a junior flight attendant to tell me they had got nowhere! End result was that we landed 1.5 hours late, and I missed my connection. Thanks to BA, I got transferred to the next available flight which was nearly 3 hours later. despite being told to the contrary, my luggage went missing! I arrived home at 11.30pm (over 3.5 hours late) and after spending lots of time on phone chasing my luggage, eventually received it at 7pm the next night.
Whereas I accept circumstances do happen, I don't accept the abysmal customer service Royal Air Maroc gave on the day. I was given the impression that they were looking after their joining customers, but couldn't care less about those with further connections at LHR (cynic in me suggests because they were then out of the loop!?).

"My husband and I went to Marrakech for vacations last week, and choose this airline as we thought it would be efficient.
Unfortunately we did not read the reviews before booking our tickets.

Even if our first flight was ok! the second flight was changed several times before our trip. We first booked to leave Marrakech the latest possible and take advantage of our last day and the flight was modified to depart very early on the last day. At the end the time was again modified and this time also the company. They informed us that we would be travelling with Avion Express which is a leasing aircrafts company that work with them.
When we first contacted them by facebook, the asked us to pay in order to modify our departure time and to move to a different flight!!!!

At the end, our flight that should leave at 10:25 departed at almost 1pm and in the meantime no new or information was given to us and the other people waiting in the terminal. When we got to enter to the aircraft, no excuse word came out from the mouth of any operator or cabin crew member (even though from the only lady that was representing Royal Air Maroc airlines). We were very dissapointed.
The food was horrible and the attention almost inexistent.

"My travel group and I are in Morocco at the moment. I flight to Morocco was different than any other flight I have ever taken. Lets just say that RAM has lived up to all that I have read about them.       Our plane pushed back from the gate with no prior announcement while people were standing and walking in the aisles as well as in the overhead compartment. This followed the playing of the safety video which the the flight crew ignored while “they went about their business “.         I have never in all my years of travel seen flight crew that was so rude and miserable. My friend who I was sitting with asked for some orange juice with her breakfast and was rudely told “We are done serving drinks”. The good is just ok which is to be expected these days but the breakfast is a carb fest. It consisted of a roll, a pastry and muffin.       I should add that some of us had selected seats ahead of time and were moved around  prior to the flight. My friend and I had selected two aisle seats across from each other and ended up with an aisle and middle seat. Married couples in our group were separated by rows as well.       The plane is turned around from the inbound flight in less than two hours and it shows because it was filthy. We flew a 787-9 which being a relatively new plane had issues.

"We flew Royal Air Maroc for the first time with some concern having read the less than positive reviews. We were very pleasantly surprised and pleased with the flight - both the plane and the crew.
Having flown to London from Boston on another airline and landing at 6:30 am at Heathrow, we were TIRED. Our flight on RAM out of Heathrow had been cancelled several days before our Boston departure and we booked a flight to Casablanca (then onto Marrakech) out of Gatwick. The layover in London was 9 hours and we were road-weary and overwhelmed when we boarded our business class flight to Casablanca. That being said, the crew was pleasant. There are some quirks inherent in Moroccan service... they seem unwilling to go the extra mile. They do exactly what they are trained to do but don’t do more. Once dinner was served and finished, we didn’t see them unless we tracked them down for more wine, more water, etc.
However, the food was GOOD! The funny thing is they brought out menus then were completely non-plussed when we requested our choice from same. The starter was supposedly smoked duck - it turned out to be smoked salmon (a plus). The entrees offered were salmon or chicken stuffed with spinach. These turned out to be grilled beef and chicken tagine.
The food was tasty, we didn’t get sick so all was good.
Bottom line - if heading to Marocco, don’t hesitate to fly RAM. They apparently have taken previous negative feedback to heart and are stepping up their service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/d8/46/06/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bjf4112,Bjf4112 wrote a review Mar 2019,Bjf4112,"Marrakech, Morocco",21 contributions,28 helpful votes,London - Marrakech,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r657578622-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Very pleasantly surprised ,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My only gripe is not with RAM but the Moroccan authorities at Casa airport.

So RAM is a decent airline if you don’t need anything.  I mean anything.  They speak next to zero English.  If you require a wheelchair you are out of luck.  Don’t try to do much at the gate as it won’t happen.  They don’t leave on time and they don’t really care.  They will change gates with little warning. Ride at your own risk.

"I have to compare this flight from Casa with the flight to Casa which was operated by a different airline. The personal acted more like those from a standard carrier than a low cost carrier which operated the other fight, there was a menu which was tasty even though I didn't bought explicitly. Online chick-in was available.

Anything was at least a bit better than in the flight to Casa except the width of the chairs. The low cost carrier used an A320 while Royal Air Marocused a B737 both 6 chairs a row. The difference in diameter is not big (20cm shared by 6 chairs in the row) still in B737 I felt restricted and in the A320 not so much. All in all I value the space more than the better service.

"My wife and I had just finished a wonderful tour of Morocco and were on our way back home. Our international flight departed from Casablanca but our tour ended in Marrakech and as such we booked a domestic flight to get back to Casablanca. After arriving at the airport at 4am we made it through security and waited for our call to board that never came. We waited and waited, checking the departure board and Royal Air Maroc (RAM) website, both of which said everything was on schedule. Our departure time came and passed with no information coming our way. After hounding several employees we were first told that the plane had not yet arrived to Casablanca due to bad weather. Another employee told us the plane was on the tarmac from the previous night (which it was, they showed us) but that the flight could not leave due to poor weather / fog at Marrakech airport. However, we watched and heard every other major airline takeoff that morning without issue but RAM was unable to. There were only 7 customers in the terminal waiting for the flight. We then saw on the departure board that there was another RAM flight to Casablanca at 10:00. I began to wonder if RAM was using the fog as an excuse to cancel an empty plane. Two hours after our plane was scheduled to depart, we were given the word that the flight was cancelled and that we would be put on the next available flight. By this time the fog had cleared, not that it stopped any other flight, so why could our flight not depart? This 4hr delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in Casablanca. As such we had to pay out of pocket to rebook another flight home, hotel for the evening and all associated meals. When I requested to speak with a management representative of RAM at Marrakech airport I was denied. I asked the employee who we were speaking to for his name and badge number, at which point he declined and hid his badge from me. Another representative offered us free breakfast due to the inconvenience which was a coffee and croissant. A follow up compliant via email was dismissed by RAM stating the incident was not their fault and was due to weather. However no one could answer my question why no other flight was delayed or cancelled due to weather that morning.

In summary, the event took place (in my belief) because the airline wanted to save money. The employees were dishonest, deceitful and when asked for support became defensive. They took no responsibility for their actions. If you choose to use RAM please consider this as an example of what may happen to you.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tay008,Tay008 wrote a review Feb 2019,Tay008,"Southampton, Canada",1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Marrakech - Casablanca,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r654136254-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Unreliable, avoid",Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I read many reviews about lost baggage and did not check my bag flying into Morocco (I prefer carry on anyway). However I did check my bag on my return flight and held my breath while checking my bag status on RAM's website often. No problems with my luggage.
On my return flight from Marrakech, I had a layover of 13 hours in Casablanca. FYI RAM only gives you free transit accommodation for a long layover if you are arriving from an international flight. Since I arrived from a domestic flight, no free hotel for me. Luckily I have Priority Pass and was able to hang out in the lounges.
Your ticket might have a group number on it but it's really only a difference between business and economy class and business doesn't even necessarily board first; they just have a dedicated line.
The planes were okay. The bathrooms were generally clean but for some reason they had only tissue and toilet paper, no paper towels. Also the toilet seat cover would not stay up so I usually had to hold it up with my hand or use the diaper changing table to prop it up. I would not say that the flight attendants were friendly but not nasty either. The fish was very bland, no seasoning at all. The beef fish was much better but small portions. They do give you bread, yogurt, and a small dessert with meals.

"This was the worst experience I've ever had on an airline. Flight got delayed by over 6 hours, which caused us to miss our connecting flight, had to stay the night in Moroccan airport, which had no heat, random stray animals, random soldiers, flickering lights, broken chairs, employees sleeping in random locations and NO ONE cared about customer service. They treated us as if we were a problem, or a pest. get the picture? Disorder and chaos everywhere. They lost our bags, and after 14 hours of no sleep wandering through the airport they gave us a flight to Paris. Ultimately what should have taken 13 hours took 28hours.

"Once again, I had a lovely experience with Royal Air Maroc RAM and Mohammed V airport travelling from london heathrow to Casablanca. This review is based on both flights outbound and return. All staff from the Airport to the Aeroplane staff were welcoming and helpful. No long queues or issues. Depending on the time of your flight there may be a short queue at the lower ground entrance if your get the train from Casa Port station to the airport (train take 30-35 mins and has two stops) as police check your passport and scan your bags. This time the airport was slightly busier with a flight time of 13:30. I have travelled before on the first flight of the day and the last flight of the evening and all were fine with no  queues. Ensure you leave yourself enough time and you will be fine. I normally arrive 3-2.5 hours before my flight time and give myself time to relax by the gate and have a hot drink and food. No long queues at check in and all were organised efficiently. Smooth process through security and again at the boarding gate. Great service on board the plane, food was delicious. Loved the lentil dish with sultanas as a cold salad and the beef with artichokes and vegetable tagine with bread, the custard flan for desert was also amazing. Previous meals have been breakfast for morning flights of an omelet bread butter /cheese a salmon and a yoghurt with hot and cold drinks served / a side salad chicken and potato dish with a yoghurt bread butter/cheese.

"Hello all,
I was flying to Monrovia by Ethiopian airlines but i had some very bad experience, so i have changed my route using Royal Air Maroc this time,
I flew from Egypt to Casablanca by Egypt Air,then from Casablanca to Monrovia by Royal Air Maroc, i would like to share my comments about this experience.

Casablanca Airport is very nice, people are so friendly,
Free meals are terrible, i could not eat a meal, tried.

Free hotel is nice, small nice air-conditioned rooms.

The flight, plane was not cleaned and i found some food remainings on the seat, the food was terrible i was too hungry and hangry, hardly ate, the cup was not cleaned, i asked to be changed, the plane seemed to be old,no movies screen, no any intertainment ...

I think it is always based on the destination where i beleive this is a kind of RACISM.. same time and even less ticket price to Europe is better plane and better service, but when it comes to Africa, very high ticket price and awful service.

"My flight from Casablanca to Agadir (less than 1 hour) was delayed for about 4 hours.
No drinks or snacks were offered and no compensation for the delay is granted.

For me what's even worse, is that at the airport they give you this written confirmation about the delay so you can contact RAM customer service afterwards. Clearly this is just to keep everyone quiet and to make you shut up at the airport because when you contact RAM about the delay they just reply they're not responsible and it was due to ""operational reasons"". It's just an easy excuse but as I know a thing or two about Air Law, they *are* responsible. They just don't take responsibility for their own mess.
Shame on you RAM!!!

"Flight down was fine.5 days before our return recieved an email saying our 7.30am flight was cancelled and we had been placed on the 9.50am flight from Agadir to Casablanca with a connecting flight to Gibraltar on a through ticket. This would have meant we would miss our connecting flight.
Went to Air Maroc office in Agadir and they would rebook our flight but would not pay for a hotel for the night. To minimise the inconvenience wee took a flight at 0005 hrs on day of departure. It meant being in transit for7 hours. We were direted to the Oasis lounge where you have a place to lay down. It meant we could get a little sleep.
Had some breakfast we paid for finally boarded our flight and got home.
Because this flight left and returned to an EU airport they are required to pay us each Euros 260.00. Their is a case out of the European Court of Justice involving Air Maroc that they have to pay this money.
We made a claim and they said they did not have to pay because they are not an EU based airline. They refused to pay the compensation. We are looking at court action in Gibraltar and if we win get a court order to seize an aircraft and get paid that way.
Stat at Agadir told us that this happens all the time. If they have two flights leaving within a short time of each other they will cancel the first flight and put every one on the later flight going to the same destination. From what they said this happens a lot and it is done to save money. To hell with the passengers.We will not be flying with Air Maroc again and urge all persons to be careful in a similar matter.

When flying to Casablanca from Barcelona the flight was delayed. They offered no reason as to why they did not start boarding the plane but it appeared as though the plane had just arrived with passengers and needed to be unloaded. It seemed like they booked the departure time too close to when the arriving flight would be coming in. This was a minor issue though and we were not too late leaving. Unfortunately my return flight to Barcelona was a much worse experience. Once again it appeared as though the airplane arrived full of passengers with not enough time to unload the plane for the scheduled departure time. Once again no one informed us what was going on. Finally after waiting an extra 30 minutes with no instruction they began to scan boarding passes. You would think we would have been boarding the plane but that was not the case. Instead they scanned everyones boarding pass and let us go down the escalator into a small area where the doors were not open to actually get to the plane. They continued to let everyone through thinking they were getting on the plane when we were actually being jammed into a small area. Eventually they had to emergency stop the escalator because there was not enough room for a whole airplane of people to be jammed into such a small space. After another 30 minutes of being crammed in that area one staff member came and opened the doors. Instead of just letting us on the airplane she proceeded to once again check every single passengers passport with the name of the boarding pass as if it had not been checked already. Because of this it took close to another 30 minutes to board the plane. The passengers were offered no explanation as to what was going on. After another 30 minute wait on the runway we were finally able to take off. I was sitting at the very back of the plane in the aisle seat and trying to sleep. For whatever reason even after the meal was served the flight attendant continued to open the cupboard for the food cart and slam the doors into my seat. This happened around 7 times. We finally landed in Barcelona late and i will never take RAM again.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmatracey2019,Emma Tracey wrote a review Feb 2019,Emma Tracey,,1 contribution,,Casablanca - Barcelona,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r649614291-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Awful experience with RAM,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"From arrival at the Casablanca airport to checkin, to security, to immigration, to gate, and finally in the plane, every step is disorganized, personnel are clueless, can't speak English, not friendly, I had selected seats three months prior to my departure and confirmed the day I was flying. When we got to the airport at Casablanca, our family was put in separate seats. employee at the counter told us that gate people will take care of it, when we got to the gate, we were told that aircraft crew will take care of it. when we got the plane the crew told us that the desk people should have taken care of you and we can not do anything. Communication was very difficult as staff staff could hardly speak English. We heard other people shouting in the plane for same reason. I am sure someone gave preference to Moroccans and messed up families seating arrangements not realizing that they will loose customers for good.

"On January 9, 2019 we flew flight AT201 from NYC(JFK) to Casablanca. Seeing all the negative reviews I was compelled to add my pleasant experience. The only negative thing was that the flight was delayed about one hour due to security issues. From the first call to board to our backing away from the terminal was about 30 minutes so they certainly tried to make up for the lost time.

All interactions with RAM personnel were professional and courteous although there were no problems that called for any other behavior. Food service was quick and efficient. There was a good quality dinner and later breakfast. I manage my expectations so I am usually satisfied with airline food.

Over the head ear phones, cabin socks, and sleeping mask are provided for each passenger

Seat back entertainment was good, quick load times, etc.

We flew on a 787. Overall the plane was very clean. The seats were firm and not as soft from use as many airline seats seem to be. They were covered in a fake leather type vinyl which I prefer to the cloth variety. When the seatback reclines the seat bottom slides forward which is less intrusive on the person behind you.

On January 16th was the return flight. Everything was pretty much the same. There was an additional security check at the gate which slowed boarding a bit but passengers began boarding about 2 hrs. before the flight. Carry on was searched by hand and we were patted down. We were ready to depart on time but departure was delayed by ""military"" activity or something like that. Our landing was at JFK was about 20 minutes later than scheduled.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKozlow,AKozlow wrote a review Jan 2019,AKozlow,,2 contributions,2 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r646808038-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Very pleasant round trip flight,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I experienced something on this flight one normally reads about only on the news...but more on that in a bit.

I arrived at Casablanca Airport (CMN) with about 3 hours until my 11:30 am flight to Brussels. As is customary in most Arab countries, one must go through security before actually checking in. Have your passport and flight docs ready to present to the guard.

CMN is Royal Air Maroc's (RAM) hub and operates a huge check-in area in Terminal 2. I checked in the day before, but used the kiosk to obtain my boarding pass. I proceeded to security/immigration and an agent directed me to a line (it's nice there are people to direct instead of passengers wondering if they can approach or not). All in all, it took about 15 minutes for this process.

Once past, I made my way to the Pearl Lounge (accessible with Priority Pass). My boarding pass indicated boarding would commence around 10:50 am. After a final sip of coffee, I made my way to gate A2. Note A-gates use jet bridges while B- and C-gates use buses. The majority of RAM flights use A gates.

Once I arrived at my gate, I noticed boarding lanes for different groups. I was in group B and decided to join the fray. Our agent began to board families, people who needed extra time, and folks in business class. Then, things became heated...

As she continued to board people, a group of passengers (from a canceled Bordeaux-bound flight) ran up to our jet bridge door and staged a sit-in. NO JOKE. They stood in front of the door and demanded RAM do something for their canceled flight. In fact, this group was one of many that blocked other Europe-bound RAM flights. A family (from my flight) tried to board and almost got into a fight with one of the protestors.

Confused and alarmed, we all looked around and wondered where the police were. Fast forward 30 minutes and the protestors were STILL in front of the door. Police finally arrived, but DID NOTHING. I suppose they were just there to ensure no actual fighting broke out.

A RAM Manager finally arrived and started yelling at the protestors. One of the passengers from my flight then confronted the manager and those two started yelling.

Didn't I tell you? It's a situation you only read about...

50 minutes later and everyone is becoming unrest. I then hear a passenger from my flight yell that there's a new gate (in the C area). So we all run down to the new gate only to be chased by the protestors. Once we arrived at the new gate, the agent said our flight was not departing from here. Everyone is angry at this point when someone yells to go back to the original gate.

We all haul back to the original gate where they finally boarded all Brussels passengers. To my relief, I made it on the jet bridge, but everyone kept looking back to make sure the protestors didn't usurp the bridge.

Finally settled in my seat (to a full flight, no less), we taxied and departed an hour late for Brussels.

Service was fine, if not robotic; though, one flight attendant always had a smile on his face. They served a hot meal and I ate a chicken/rice dish along with tabbouleh, cake, a roll and water.

There's no entertainment so BYO, but the flight only lasted three hours. The interior has seen better days, but we made it safely and were only 45 minutes late into Brussels.

I paid USD$420 for this flight (including a connecting flight from Brussels to London).

What happened to me and us Brussels passengers is, in my hope, a one off. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend RAM, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to fly them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/1c/89/1c/louie-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_glbetrkkr_,_glbetrkkr_ wrote a review Jan 2019,_glbetrkkr_,"New York City, New York",1268 contributions,339 helpful votes,Casablanca - Brussels,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r646468860-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,One For the Books...,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I chose Royal Air Maroc because they had the best flight times based on my travel plans, but I would not recommend it. The plane was super old and it was dirty. My tray-table was disgusting. When I put the tray-table down when they were serving dinner there were crusts of spilled food all over it.
The worst, however, was the customer service. I wanted to upgrade to business class or first class, but no one would even try to help me. The guy at check-in said he couldn’t do it, handed me my boarding pass and told me to go to the sales counter. There was no one at the sales kiosk. I went to the kiosk right next to it and asked the attendant, who by the way was not busy at all and was just watching a video on her phone. This attendant told me she only handled excess luggage and couldn’t help me. I asked if she could get someone who could me help or if she knew when the sales kiosk would open, but she again replied with “I only handle excess luggage”. Asked at the check-in counter if I could upgrade (I’ve done that at other airlines), again I got a reply of “I only do check-in”. Stopped at customer service desk in Casablanca during my connection, and they said they only handled passengers with missed connections. Finally someone showed up at the sales counter in Casablanca, but the attendant was super rude and wouldn’t pull up my flight on her computer to take a look. She kept saying it was full and I couldn’t upgrade. She wouldn’t even look at her computer. Business class was definitely not full, because I saw lots of empty seats when I boarded the plane. She was just being lazy and unhelpful.
I’ve never seen this kind of behavior with another airline, where employees just do one single thing and won’t help you at all unless you need help with that very specific thing they do. They won’t even try to get someone else who might help.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBtravel123,BBtravel wrote a review Jan 2019,BBtravel,"New York City, New York",99 contributions,56 helpful votes,Marrakech - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r646154516-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Awful customer service and old air planes,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This airline needs to be closed down. They are an absolute embarrassment to the beautiful and welcoming country of Morocco.
They will be fine until there is a problem - and then you will be met with the most unhelpful and unprofessional people you will hopefully ever have to deal with.
Our bags have been “delayed” in Morocco for almost two weeks. Supposedly the airline knows that they are in Casablanca but are not sending them to Marrakech where we currently are and also are not giving us an official delayed / lost luggage claim for our insurance company.
I cannot even explain how much I firmly believe that you should not fly this airline.

"We read bad reviews so were worried but.....
No online check in from Manchester so we arrived early and waited 30 mins for the check in to open. The staff were quick and efficient, we were through to security in no time and on boarding the plane we found it clean and the crew very cheerful and friendly. We got allocated row 11 behind Business class so there was tons of legroom. The meal ( a tajine with extras) was quickly served and was excellent for plane food. Much better than spending money at a fast food joint in the airport.
We booked in online for the flight home and in Casa airport was helped to print the tickets by the staff without queueing up and agian on boarding the plane was clean and the crew were friendly, helpful and efficient. Once again a last tajine before home.

"I wanted to write a review as soon as I stepped off the plane to reassure any travellers. After reading lots of bad reviews online about the airline and airport. I was not looking forward to flying with RAM and was anxious about how we would treated at the airport or even worse miss a flight based on reviews.

I don’t think enough people who don’t experience issues write a review so I feel like I should share.

We experienced no issues,no delays, no rudeness or bad cleanliness as people mentioned.

Staff were polite, friendly, welcome and informative, helpful if a customer asked a question from the start of us entering Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca to arrival in a London. Computers times and boarding information were also up to date. I was very pleased. So thank you to all RAM and Airport staff for the pleasant journey and lovely service.

"In a nutshell, this was the worst airline I’ve traveled with, period. We decided to use RAM to travel to Banjul (JFK - CMN - BJL the return same way). Heading out there was a delay and nine of the gate agents gave us a reason why or could answer questions. Then they tried seating us apart from one another. I insisted and they finally obliged. Inflight food was not good at all, the meat tasted funny. Getting water took an act of Congress. When we got to Casablanca we had a 13 hour layover so they put us in a hotel ( Hotel Washington) downtown that was so filthy my kids didn’t want to use the bathroom. Our flight to BJL was on time.

The biggest issue was on the return. Heed this warning because apparently this is something they do often. On 1/4/2019 we checked in in BJL. When we got Casablanca they gave us a room at Relax hotel, nicer than Hotel Washington, but staff was awful an there were no towels. Next morning we go to check in and the ticket agent said we weren’t shown on the flight. That we needed to check with RAM reservations department, and that the flight was overbooked. I walk all the way to the reservation department (to a lady named Lola yelling over the phone). Before I could finish asking my question she cut me off and said, “you never confirmed your seats, so your tickets were canceled.” What?? The she wrote “system error” on the back of my boarding pass and said I should go back to the check in counter and ask for the check 8n supervisor. They were so rude. Then sent me back to Lola. At this point the room was packed and Lola was helping someone, but I walked up to her desk and insisted she fix this.

She was babbling in French and never looked at me. I said we are getting on this flight or I will sue this airline. She said, let me see your passport, are you Americans? Because it was apparent they treat the sub Saharan Africans that travel with them poorly. I added, I don’t care who you need to bump but my family and I are getting on this flight and out of this country. She yelled at someone over the phone then asked us to follow her to check in. We made the flight, but our final destination was California and our bags didn’t make it until the next day. I’m baffled how this airline is allowed to operate in the USA. They overbook every flight. They are so rude and dismissive. When our flight landed at JFK a flight attendant bumped into a passenger and she said, “ look, we’re in the US now. Your rude behavior stops now.” And everyone clapped. I WILL NEVER USE THIS AIRLINE EVERY AGAIN.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berans2015,Beran S wrote a review Jan 2019,Beran S,,16 contributions,38 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r644193007-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Never again!

"Poor communication skills, the informations are not clear, their customer service give me wrong info multiple times, the system is never update, the staffs are left to be guessing what's really happening. The flights are always cancel and if you are black or using African passport, then, I'm sorry man, that would be your worst nightmare.
When our flight was cancel, they promise to give us hotel room, on the queue, the black people are put at the side and they instructed the white people to follow the red line. And when I ask them why are we here, the ticket man or the security guy turned around and see my passport, (which happens to be British possport) and said oh you can follow the red line too. They rest of African and black people that were there, were asking, what's happening, why are we here, but nobody listens, and to be honest I don't know how that ended.
And for us that followed the red line, we end up in farah hotel, that's another story for different platform.

"I had my worst ever international travel experience just last week with Royal Air Maroc. The problem wasn't the flight itself, which was perfectly fine. The problem was the customer service, which was almost aggressively unhelpful and generally useless.

I was flying from Rome to Washington DC on Friday 21st December. RAM had a really well priced deal and I'd never flown with them before, so I thought I'd give them a chance. The plan was to fly from Rome to Casablanca and then catch the RAM Casablanca to DC flight. Things started going wrong early. After checking in at Rome, the first flight got progressively more and more delayed until I was certain that I would miss the connection. However, RAM didn't have any staff in Rome (as far as I could tell), and all the airport staff could tell me was that RAM would sort my connection out in Casablanca. So off I go to Casablanca.

The flight to Casablanca was fine, though they didn't explain why it was three hours late in leaving. When I got there I had indeed missed my DC connection (several other passengers had also missed connections to various places too, including one other person going to DC). Not only had RAM made NO provisions to help me or the other stranded passengers (even though they must have known that we existed), but the staff at their transfer desk were (with one exception) utterly useless. When I was finally able to speak to someone, she offered to put me on the next RAM flight to Washington - in two days' time - which wasn't an option. Then she told me to go to the transfer manager's office. When I finally managed to get the transfer manager's attention, he literally faked a phone call and left; I later found out that he had just gone on a break, leaving about six stranded passengers in his office! Finally someone got hold of a policeman and told him to make the airline staff help us, which (to my surprise) he actually did.

Long story short, they finally rebooked me and the other DC-bound passenger on Air France for the next day. The whole rebooking process took FIVE HOURS, during which we had to just sit and wait. Then we had to collect our bags so that we could re-check them the next day. That took another hour. Only one of my two bags showed up. The employee at the baggage service desk gave me a claim slip, though I later discovered that the claim number that she wrote for me wasn't a real claim number.

They did put me up in a very nice hotel for the night, the Sky Atlas. Sadly I was only able to enjoy it for five hours, since I got there at midnight and had an early flight to Paris (and thence to DC). On checking in for the Paris flight, the Air France people found that RAM had made a mistake with my rebooking. The Air France employees were mercifully more helpful though and fixed it for me.

It took me a week to get my missing suitcase back, which I had to go to Dulles to collect. The baggage employee in Casablanca certainly didn't help by giving me a claim number that turned out not to be a claim number, and the fact that the RAM baggage office in Dulles wasn't open on the day that I arrived didn't help much either. Calls to the RAM New York number evidently went to a call centre in Morocco, where I could barely hear the voice at the other end. The people that I managed to speak to basically blamed me for not getting a valid claim number in Casablanca (which was their own airline's fault). Even though I had a bag tag number, they couldn't find it in their system. What's more is that their online baggage tracking system was buggy and refused to work, consistently telling me that I had entered an invalid date.

I did eventually manage to speak to one good RAM employee. When the Dulles office opened, I managed to get through to a guy on the phone (though you have to call every few minutes, as he's rarely around to pick up). The guy at Dulles managed to get my bag back for me. The airline's official channels, though, were completely useless.

To sum up: the flights may be ok, but I have never had worse customer service from an airline. Heed the bad reviews. I will happily pay more in future to avoid flying with them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/d2/f8/e8/james-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmJ7046LH,James M wrote a review Dec 2018,James M,,7 contributions,2 helpful votes,Rome - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r642202140-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,The customer service is as bad as they say,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"horrible experience from the start. Our flight leaving from Montreal was delayed 3 days, we lost 3 days of out vacation in Morocco. To make matters worse, the flight landed in the middle of the night at 2am and the next transfer to Marrakech wasn't until 11am. Rather than waste time at the airport and lose another day of our vacation, we opted to pay for a taxi to bring us from Casablanca to Marrakech.

They also cancelled our return ticket and kept giving us the run around between flight desk and their office in the airport. Every single time we tried to call their customer service phone number, we were re-routed to an automatic system and unable to resolve our issue.

Yet, the best part was losing/stealing the suitcase with everything for our baby in it.

However there is less entertainment than on Air France for example and the flight timings are not the best (particularly the return from Ouagadougou to Casablanca), but the prices are often extremely competitive.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markcZ5601AE,Mark C wrote a review Dec 2018,Mark C,,28 contributions,8 helpful votes,London - Ouagadougou,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r640965202-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Good flights, no problems",Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We needed a flight from Chicago to Casablanca and our travel agent couldn't find a good flight for us without having about 3 or 4 different stops in it so a friend of mine who is a tour guide in Spain suggested Royal Maroc Air because he has used it..I never heard of it before but I took a chance and glad I did...We flew from Chicago to Madrid on Iberia, which was fine and then took the 1 hour and 45 minute flight from Madrid to Casablanca.  Everyone was nice, the flight was smooth and we even got a MEAL on that short flight.  When we fly from Chicago to California, like 4 1/2 hours all we get is a soda and some pretzels...so we were pleasantly surprised by a full meal and drinks.  We didn't have to deal with luggage because we had it sent all the way through from Chicago to Casablanca so we didn't have to pick it up in Spain and then check it in again...our luggage arrived safe and sound in Casablanca.

This was the last flight out, so I had to overnight.  I switched to Iberia as I did not want any further experience with RAM.

"United States air travel has degenerated over the years to the status of a clip joint where the economy traveler is charged for luggage, carry on luggage, beverages, snacks, in air entertainment, pillow, blanket, every little thing!. Thus, I was surprised and delighted with the great service provided by RAM. The experience stated with the ability to check TWO bags at no extra charge! (Just like it used to be in the United States). Meals, snacks, beverages, socks, eye covers, headphones, entertainment, all complimentary (Just like it used to be in the United States). The seats were clean and comfortable, spaced far enough apart to recline, and  to not have ones knees pushed up against the seat in front.The inflight staff were courteous and managed to seat all persons quickly and efficiently. Luggage was not lost.The only little issue,  very delayed departures to and from Marrakesh Menara (RAK) airport.  On the return, the delay at Marrakech caused a small group to miss the return flight from Casablanca to New York. After seven hours, a plane eventually left for Casablanca. On arrival,  the Casablanca airport was filled with grumpy pilgrims who for some reason or other needed very many (okay, it was all) of  the luggage carts.   It was difficult to find the correct office to in order to sign up for a hotel room for the night. The staff acted as though this had never happened before. After much explanation  our group was eventually placed on a bus to very nice hotel in Casablanca. The next morning we all caught a very nice flight, courteous and efficient service, comfortable well spaced seats, headphones, entertainment, meals, snacks, beverages, and arrived in New York, approximately one day late.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikeAT,HikeAT wrote a review Dec 2018,HikeAT,"Boonton, New Jersey",19 contributions,22 helpful votes,New York City - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r640317856-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Surprised and Delighted,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After missing a connecting flight at Lisbon, I was routed onto Royal Air Maroc, connecting in Casablanca to get to Marrakech.  After the Lisbon flight was delayed, we eventually arrived in Casablanca and shuttled into a room for domestic transfers that had far too few seats for the number of passengers accommodated.  Monitors posted a ""gate"" but no announement was made about the flight.  People lined up in anticipation but the boarding time passed without even an attendant at the gate and no explanation whatsoever.  About half an hour past the time the flight was to have left, some kind of announcement was made (in French and Arabic) and I heard the word ""Quatorze"" (Fourteen) and everyone in line moved over to Gate 14, where nothing, it turned out, was actually happening.  There was an agent there - who had no information - passengers were shouting.  When I finally got up to ask, he sent me back to where I was waiting before.  Finally an agent showed up at that gate, but she was on the phone, seemingly trying to find out what was going on - nothing posted on the monitors, and no announcements.  Through the glass doors we could see the lights of several buses (you had to take a bus to the plane from these gates) who would pull in and mysteriously leave, with no indication of which flight they were taking.  Finally, as I sat in another part of the (extremely dirty and noisy) room, charging my phone, I heard a cheer and people started to board the plane.  No explanations were ever given.  I'm not sure how much to blame Royal Air Maroc and how much of it was the Casablanca Airport, but it was a thoroughly miserable experience - and at the very least there should have been something told to the passengers who were waiting patiently (or, eventually not patiently) just wondering when - or IF - we were going to board.  This was late in the evening and if I did not arrive in Marrakech that night I was going to miss the start of a group tour that departed the city the next morning, so I was on tenterhooks the same time.  Absolutely awful experience.   (btw, the flight to Marrakech, for all that waiting, was only 25 minutes long).",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6236RScarls,Carl S wrote a review Dec 2018,Carl S,"New York City, New York",5 contributions,,Lisbon - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r640218157-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Delays and No Information Provided,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We have travelled with this airline for the last 12 years to visit family. I book online and request Assistance for my husband at all airports.
Seats were booked for us to be together. On the flight out to Casablanca....no problem, we sat together.
However on the return flight we were separated....by five rows with the shift manager at check-in absolutely refusing to allow me to sit beside my husband! He was in an aisle seat and both the passengers beside him had to climb over him to get out.
I found this line taken by the check-in staff to be absolutely appalling. I appreciate the “supposed” need for him to be in an aisle seat but to place me five rows behind him was awful.

'Royal' Air Maroc seem to have a policy of accepting bookings (and customers cash) and then cancelling when realising that they don't have enough passengers to make it worth their while and shifting customers onto other flights.  This has happened to us on every one of the four flights that we have had with RAM.  Customers have to then be moved around to fit in with their needs.  My elderly mother in law flying back to Miami via Madrid from Banjul - one day early as they cancelled and put her on an earlier flight.  Promised a hotel room but they kept her in a transit room from 5.45 am until 9pm in Casablanca airport.  Promising a hotel room but the supervisor disappeared.

"Worst flight experience ever. Worst customer service ever. I went to Casablanca for a layover on the way to Spain for Thanksgiving (US holiday in November) I had a 4 hour layover going to Spain, and on the way back I had a 30+ layover and chose to stay in a hotel near the train station and attempt to learn more about the country and the country. Casablanca is thee worst. Now, in terms of the airport, I have CLEAR to speed up airport transit at the security line. I don't have enemies, but when I do have enemies, I will steer any enemies clear of this airline. When you leave from Dulles everything is great, and you feel like you're going to receive standard basic customer service. The minute you step foot in Casablanca, Morocco... all those notions, dreams, and impressions go away very quickly. Every agent is rude. Maybe there was one check-in agent that had manners, but the vast 99% do not, and I don't think they link their customer service to continued business (money for their salaries). Stay away. While in flight...I pressed the blue flight attendant button and I took pictures where 30 minutes passed... 30 minutes had gone by without any acknowledgement, can you believe it? what if it were a real emergency? The flight attendants aren't trained and they mixed up my meal.

I suggested to but a ticket from London to Casablanca and join the flight to Gambia which is just over 12 hours she categorically refuses to take my payment and advice I can only do it on Monday as they cannot take it from there side as that’s there policy. I advice her that am going to a funeral and need to be in Gambia before 1400hrs no sympathy at all. Advice to speak to a supervisor by the name of Fatima who came on to the phone after me waiting on the other hand of the phone for an hour
She said it’s there policy they can’t take the payment if a know someone in Casablanca I can get them to buy the ticket for me I said to her I have never been to Casablanca and don’t know anyone she then suggested I should go on line and manage my booking then buy a new ticket from London Heathrow to Casablanca so I will not loss my transit ticket
I went on line a tried to log in and what the system gave me was a confirm booking tried to pay which I was not able to access call them a agatand was advice to go to the Heathrow airport and when the desk staff checked on the system my name was not on the ticket for Heathrow but for Gatwick
She advised me to call them again and the lady call Maria said I needed to paid 3 hours. Before departure I advice her a I have tried to pay over 9 hours ago and your colleagues refused to take my payment
I find this service fraudulent
I need this matter to be looked into and hope it does not happen to other customers.
Thank you

"So I am not the kind of reviewer that will make a generalization of a service or company based on one negative review. This could be an isolated case. Right? But I need to share my experience traveling to Washington with this company. I had a two-hour layover in Casablanca, which should be actually a one-hour layover since the place from Barcelona to Casablanca delayed. However, on the time we were supposed take off, they made us stay on a 30-40 minute line like we were going to board, only to give us vouches for a meal and say that we could stay in their lounge because the flight would be delayed for 5 hours. Mind you, this is no lounge you would care to go. You can have a (plastic) glass of water or tea and that's it. Then, you can going back and forth lost in the airport where no one speaks English while they will point you in different directions for the lounge.

My main complaints are about how inefficient and condescending the staff is. Do not treat your clients like we are kids. Do not make us stay in pointless lines and please use of effective communication. There are so many easier and stress-free ways to make this experience better that would cost NOTHING to the company. Why wouldn't you just give the lounge and the restaurant a list with the passengers from the flight so we could just check in? Why make us stay in all those lines? Why don't you explain what is going on? Casablanca airport already is the airport I most detest in the planet, and mind you I travel a lot. It's hot, the staff treats English speakers very badly.. don't make our experience worse when traveling!

In monetary terms, I would rather pay $100-150 more to fly using another company now then going through this again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/7c/49/c3/patricianeid.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patricianeid,Patricianeid wrote a review Dec 2018,Patricianeid,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",98 contributions,21 helpful votes,Barcelona - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r638016640-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Will avoid it from now on,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Being a gold member or a routine passenger doesn't make any difference. Business class remains the absolute minimum. No service delivery, and for many of the staff when confronted with a question, the solution out of sight is out of mind.

"I was booked on a flight to Marrakech from New York this October.  It was delayed by over 6 hours and the agents were unhelpful regarding my connection from Casablanca to Marrakech.  Finally, landed in Marrakech and there was utter chaos and the agents were rude. After much arguing I was put on a bus to Marrakech and landed there at midnight, losing the entire day for sightseeing.  On my return, despite a confirmed ticket, they insisted that my name was not on the flyer list. Ultimately, I prevailed and they let me board.  I had ordered special meals that were confirmed at the time of booking but I did not get them.  Basically, I went hungry on the flight.

"Flight delayed for more than 4 hours. No explanation given. No food or beverages provided.

Back in Doha, we complained for the delay and the bad service, they answered within 2 months and agreed to pay us back as per the European Convention and mentioned it would take 4 to 6 weeks to get the refund as soon as we provide our bank details. We did on 28 September. It has been 8 weeks now and nothing has come. We have to contact them every 3 days, and every 3 days we get the same answer ""we will check the problem and get back to you as soon as possible"". And nobody gets back to us.

A lot of time wasted, service isnt good either. I was told today that there is no Manager in charge of complaints... so it is whenever the employees decide to process your refund....(!!)

Airport is below average. I was supposed to fly again with them next March, but I will find another airline instead.

"We booked this flight/trip to Rome because our son saw the excellent price and options to overnight in Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc.

Very fortunately, we did not have any of the negative experiences we read on TripAdvisor.

Our suitcases were checked at IAD to FCO. The bags were shrink-wrapped/plastic wrapped and despite TSA not replacing our suitcase lock at IAD, everything arrived as packed in FCO.

The Boeing 787 was super comfortable. Casual boarding. Lovely flight crew, plenty of food and liquid refreshment options. A bit of confusion with the time changes (Daylight Saving Time?) but not a big deal.

Return trip, Royal Air Maroc changed our return plans, but provided accommodations, transportation to/from the hotel, food. Again our suitcases were check through to IAD, plastic wrapped and arrived as expected. The crew was professional.

"We had a return flight from Casablanca (CAS) to Washington (IAD). We got our boarding pass at around 1.15pm for the flight that was departing at 4.30pm and we were at the gate at 2.30pm. We were denied boarding because the Airline staff couldn’t speak English and they assumed we were going to an Asian or African country based on our brown skin color. In the meantime, the flight left. Consequently, one of the staff was extremely sorry and informed us that this was their assumption. I mentioned so many times that we are going to IAD but they kept telling us to wait and when I requested to speak to a supervisor/higher authority, they finally said the flight left. They refused to give their name or their supervisor’s name despite our repeated request. To save money, the airlines is least interested in providing any training. We expect that the staff in the International Airport can at least communicate in English.

"Check in was a nightmare - the counters opened 3 hours early but there were only 2 in use. It took a long time but that wasn’t really the airlines fault as half the people had ridiculous amounts they were trying to have as carry on. Some actually got through. The seats were cramped and some were broken, there was excessive luggage not put in compartments. But what really showed them up was there was no safety feature. I’ve never ever been on a flight that doesn’t have this- surely it’s a legal requirement!
One of the attendants had obviously been rushed as her buttons were all open - I don’t know why this matters but that simple act of unprofessionalism really says it all and makes you query whether they take other shortcuts. Food - didn’t see any but coffee was available. I did think the attendants were friendly though when we saw them.
When we landed safely there was great applause - haha I joined in thankful to be on ground.

"I flew two legs of an open jaw ticket to Europe with Royal Air Maroc (Marrakech-Casablanca and Casablanca to Dohar) on 1 Nov 2018, with the majority of my flights being on Qatar. RAM is a Qatar program partner, and the airline combination produced a great price on Skyscanner. Well, folks, you get what you pay for – and I didn’t read the reviews of RAM prior to booking. Flight AT402 from Marrakech to Casablanca was fine. At only 50 minutes, the plane went up, flew at cruising altitude for about 15 minutes, then landed. All fine there, apart from having to walk across the tarmac and up a flight of steps to board. Same deal landing in Casablanca in reverse. Then the nightmare started.

Separating of passengers connecting to international flights and those terminating in Casablanca was done outside the rear entry doors to the arrivals terminal. Passengers were jammed up against the side of the building standing in puddles of water (as it had been raining) waiting to have their passport and ticket examined by one of two officials who told them to go through either the international connections door or the domestic arrivals door. It actually started to rain lightly while I was waiting which wasn’t much fun. Then another bus of disembarking passengers pulled up and there was no room for them to get off the bus and stand safely out of danger from passing airport vehicles. It was slow-moving mayhem, and I’d imagine that people with tight connections missed their flights. I had a 3-hour layover, so once inside the arrivals terminal, I settled down and waited for AT216 to Doha. Luckily I checked the departure gate several times as it was changed without notice or announcement shortly before boarding opened (from Level 1 to the ground level). Again we had to walk across the tarmac and climb stairs to board.

Everything seemed fine as we taxied down the runway… then sat for about 20 minutes. Eventually an announcement was made that we were going back to the terminal, and we taxied back. A hoist/lift was wheeled out to the right-hand wing and several mechanics peered at a central flap which was elevated (the other flaps were all lying flush with the edge of the wing), and made calls on their mobile phones. So we sat… and sat… and sat… for 3 hours 45 minutes! No announcements were made, no refreshments were given, nothing! Eventually I went to the galley to get some water and asked one of the male flight attendants what was happening, and was told there was a “technical services” problem, but that we should be leaving within 15 minutes. Well, that never happened. By that stage, people were getting tired and irritable. The two very small children in front of me were going beserk, screaming, jumping up and down, crying, running up and down the aisles, etc – understandable, as they were bored witless (as were we all). Luckily it wasn’t a hot day as the plane’s air conditioning wasn’t running, but it got really stuffy and uncomfortable. People started sleeping across three seats if they had a row to themselves. Eventually we were told to prepare for takeoff. The flight attendants who had been sitting in the galley for most of the previous 3 hours 45 minutes appeared and made a cursory check of the cabin. The man behind me was still sleeping across three seats as we started taxiing down the runway, not strapped in or anything! I was about to draw the attention of one of the bored flight attendants to this when he spotted him, shook him awake and told him to sit up and buckle up. No safety briefing was given as we were just about to take off.- unbelievable!

As we took off, I had a clear view out the window of the wing – and the flap WHICH WAS STILL ELEVATED! Nothing had changed. I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best, reassured somewhat that several people had been taking photos with their mobile phones which I thought would at least be found if we crashed. So it was a nerve wracking 6-hour flight to Doha. We made up about 45 minutes in the air, but I still had to run through Doha airport to make my QR900 connection to Perth as boarding had commenced at the same time as the RAM flight landed.

I would never fly RAM again. They’re disorganised, don’t apparently maintain their aircraft adequately and pay scant regard to safety. I felt less than confident on a 6-hour flight with them as the “technical services” issue did not appear to have been rectified. In addition, we were not kept informed as to what the problem with the aircraft was, nor given refreshments on board while we waited for the problem to be fixed.

On the plus side, however, my luggage magically appeared at Perth airport, despite the extremely short connection time in Doha. However, I suspect that was Qatar’s efficient service, not RAM’s.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864VickiM,Vicki M wrote a review Nov 2018,Vicki M,"Perth, Australia",14 contributions,19 helpful votes,Casablanca - Doha,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r634805909-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Questionable safety standards, lengthy delay and total lack of communication",Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me start with the positives: affordable and free checked baggage.

Negatives: old planes, absolutely FILTHY planes, very disorganized, unhelpful staff, no wifi onboard, and often delayed. The staff don't care about customers or needs, just nod their heads and tell you what you want to hear in an effort to appease you but don't actually do anything. Despite booking seats together, confirming those seats via their app, arriving at the airport and checking in 3 1/2 hours early, they changed our seats to both sitting on opposite sides of the plane and in the middle middle seat.

All of that being said, the airline served its purpose but beyond that, I would seek out alternatives (not sure there are any?).

"I was on a flight that got cancelled and it was crazy. Our plane apparently had technical issues, so I’m glad they didn’t send us on it, but the lack of communication was astounding.

When we were supposed to be boarding, there was no announcement, then after a while, they told us that we going to board in 20 minutes or so. We then were told it would be 40 more minutes, then 15 minutes, then an hour. At some point they started giving out food vouchers (with no announcement) for $20 (which doesn’t go far at JFK). Shortly after that, they said our flight was cancelled (this is around midnight and the airport forced them to either board the plane or cancel the flight).

Here is where things start to get crazy. They made the announcement that the flight was cancelled and when people started asking questions, all they said was “go to H” I don’t think anybody knew what H was, but the people at the desk started power walking out and everybody (about 150 people) was following them out of the secured area of the airport. I felt bad for the older people, people who didn’t speak English, and people with young kids, because it was like a race! Once we got out to the ticketing area (which I assume is what they were referring to when they said to go to H), we walked in an entire circle around the perimeter of the ticketing areas. This is about the time that I started to wonder if we were being punked! Most of the people working for the airline seemed to disappear and with the exception of one very nice, very patient woman. She was trying to help explain things to everyone, but she didn’t have all the answers herself, so I felt bad for her.

After about an hour sitting there in the middle of the empty ticketing area, they brought some busses and took us to two hotels on Long Island. We were told that we would fly out in the morning. By the time I got into my room, it was 2am. We had no idea what time we would be flying out and no idea how we would be notified.

The next morning, I didn’t wake up until 9am (I was on California time and was exhausted). When I went out to the lobby for breakfast, there was no new news. Most people hung out in the lobby because it felt like that was where we needed to be to get any news. There were a lot of theories going around, but no actual news other than the fact that anybody that was continuing on beyond Morocco was put on another flight so they could get where they were going. People were saying that it felt like we were being sequestered.

Around noon, we were told that we would be picked up from the hotel at 3:45pm. But that is all the information we had. That at least allowed us the freedom to leave the hotel to go get lunch.

At 4pm, we finally left the hotel and went to the airport. We still didn’t know our flight time and nobody actually told us until we got the ticket desk and got rebooked for the same flight we had booked for the previous day.

Finally, 24 hours after our originally scheduled flight, we boarded the plane and flew to Morocco.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/25/89/88/calbusinesstraveler.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalBusinessTraveler,CalBusinessTraveler wrote a review Nov 2018,CalBusinessTraveler,"Sacramento, California",68 contributions,26 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r632481889-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,No communication ,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My trip was from LHR via CDG to TNG. A bag that I checked in never arrived at my final destination. RAM informed me after a month that the bag was permanently lost and so I put in a claim with them for the value of the contents. They only offered to pay only a tenth of the value. I initially declined this but, having been beaten by the whole process of dealing with them, I accepted. However, 14 months later, I'm still waiting for my claim to be paid. There is only one email address that RAM give out for claims and all that results if you mail them is an automated reply and little else. If you try social media (Facebook) to get a response, one gets a 'An urgent notice has been sent to the department in charge to get back to you as soon as possible' as a reply. Guess what, nothing happens after that. Judging by other peoples comments on FB, RAM make a habit of losing bags. I would suggest that if you fly with them then take hand luggage only. Better still, don't fly with them.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stan1000000,Stan1000000 wrote a review Nov 2018,Stan1000000,"London, United Kingdom",20 contributions,23 helpful votes,Paris - Tangier,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r632212684-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Appalling customer service,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Very nice breakfast and very good coffee.

No landing cards on board.

I was asked to sleep in a common area that was old, smelly and a poorly maintained bathroom.

"If you want your vacation spoiled then choose Royal air maroc.i'm not going to talk about the bad customer service, but I just want you to avoid all the drama i experienced with this airline.
they took our carry-on basgs from us at JFK airport and they told us we will receive them when we get to Casablance. And since we have to little kids we gave them the carry-ons and that was a big mistake.
When we landed in Casablanca we were told that the carry-ons didn't make it to here and they will send them tomorrow. I opened a claim and the lady was not helpful at all. When I asked her why the bags never arrived she answered that the pilot can decide to leave the bags behind if the plane is full.
We were told to call and check if the bags arrived and if yes we have to go get them because in Morocco they don't deliver lost luggage to your home. Even we live 120 miles away from Casablanca we agreed to that and after a week a got a call that our bags arrived.
unfortunately, It was just one bag, the one with no valuable belongings.The other bag which has all our valuable stuff disappeard apparently.
the most funny thing is that we were told to pay $150 because the bag was overweight.We tried to complain and talk to somebodyand nobody seems to care.
We left that bag to them since the value of what was inside it is under $150.
We kept calling them about the other bag for 2 months in vain.
We've never got any call or email from the airline to give us any update about the bag.And when we were heading back to the States our flight was delayed 4 hours because the pilots were on strike.
Our saty in Morocco was spoiled.

Flight left almost on time, though both in JFK and in Casablanca there seemed to be at least a half hour of standing in line to board and it was not at all clear why that was necessary.

"I didn't really have a choice in airlines when this was booked, and I was very nervous about using them as they have a terrible reputation. First off their boarding area was tiny and basically nonexistent. there was nowhere to sit,  unless you wanted to sit on the floor! It was packed and miserable and we were there  hours early. The airport is dirty and nasty, ripped seats etc. It was also confusing because where we boarded was not labeled properly. THEN the worst part took place, or so I thought. we were put on a tiny terrible bus , so packed you had to stand up against everyone  The bus jerked so bad you would unsteady and unsecured. There are also no bars  to hold onto at that capacity so you are constantly smashing into everyone surrounding you (since you're touching anyway). Horrific experience! It was so hot you could barely breathe. Then you are standing on the tarmac trying to board the place which involves climbing straight up steps into the plane, which is not always easy when you are carrying so many heavy bags. By the time we got on the plane, it was exhausting. Once on the plane we sat on the tarmac FOREVER in a million degree heat inside the plane and out. Everyone frantically fanning themselves and gasping for air. I felt like heat exhaustion was setting in! and no one cared one bit about the people having a hard time. Why they wouldn't turn on the plane is beyond me. Never have i ever experienced a flight like this and I will surely never go through this again! I could not wait to get off.

"I traveled with this awful airline with one stop via Casablanca where I saw flights cancelled and people wondering around like headless chickens as no one informed them of what to do... our flight was delayed for an hour also.

Once we arrived at Marrakesh menara airport the passport check had 2.5 hour queues.. asking my friend strange questions like “where is your dad from?” by then I had lost the will to live.

Then the cherry on the top: I stood by the baggage reclaim carousel for an hour until it was turned off next to another women who was crying her baggage was also missing. I went to the baggage office and was given a lost bag receipt and sent on my way. I spent 3 whole days without my luggage- I had nothing but my purse, keys and phone on me. I borrowed off of my friend the whole holiday which was stressful enough but customer service did nothing to help, if anything the women took a frustrated tone and told me I have to wait as there’s nothing she can do: “madam, just go to the airport and check if it’s there”.... thanks a lot Fatima.

I got my luggage back the day I flew back to London. Thank god.

All in all a terrible experience, I don’t think Iv ever been so stressed on a holiday in all my life.

"We flew Royal Air Maroc to and from Rome, connecting through Casablanca, their home airport. In flight service was good on three flights, excellent on the CMN/IAD leg. In flight moivies did not work on the second long flight. Food was delightful and paced well. Boarding was a challenge on all four legs. Business class was either not queued separately or simply overlooked. With the exception of the initial IAD/CMN leg all boarding required waiting on a bus for carriage to the airplane, then climbing the stairs into the plane. All deplaning, except IAD was done in this fashion. It was especially bothersome as we deplaned and boarded in the rain while connecting at Casablanca. Terminals at CMA and FCO have jetways, but Royal Air Maroc chooses not to utilize them for many flights.

"We were travelling from Marrakech to USA with connecting flights at Casablanca and then at Amsterdam.
Royal Air Maroc is extremely unreliable and our flight was delayed at Marrakech for over 3 hours without explanation or any customer service. As a result, we missed our connecting flights at Casablanca and at Amsterdam. This delay costs us over a $1000 to rebook our flights and hotel and it took us over 3 days to come back to USA from Marrakesh.
The worst part is that the Royal Air Maroc staff has no intention of helping through out this flight delay situation, not even letting us to use their land line to rebook our flight at the Casablanca airport as our cell phones are blocked there.

As an additional note, the plane was dirty and uncomfortable and I had diarrhea after taking the airline meal.

Avoid going to Morocco.

"My family booked 4 tickets on Royal Air Marocs website from CDG to Marrakesh. The flight was via Casablanca airport. Firstly, the plane arrived in CDG the time that we were supposed to be departing. We arrived in Casablanca 2 hours late and our flight from Casablanca to Marrakesh had already left, although we were reassured by the staff of RAM in CDG that we would make our flight. Despite their airline NOT fulfilling our flight from Casablanca,the staff was not helpful in providing options at 11 PM in the night!  Instead my family was forced to take a 4 hour bus ride to marrakesh and reached at sunrise. THIS was absolutely frustrating. They REFUSE to pay any compensation to my family and said that the maximum compensation would be 7 EUROS per person although the ticket was booked from their website CDG to Marrakesh.

"I had a trip planned out from Montreal -> Agadir connecting in Casablanca. On the way back I was to go from Agadir -> Casablanca (22 hr stay) -> Montreal. The 22 hr stay was to allow me to leave the airport and do a bit of sightseeing. Before purchase and at the airport in Montreal before leaving, I confirmed that my baggage on the return trip would be taken care of and I would not have to lug it around for 22 hours.

However, when I was leaving from Agadir to Casablanca the check-in attendant very rudely dismissed my query if the baggage would be taken care of, saying it would be not and he did not care that I was told it would be when I left from Montreal. He told me to take it up with their office in Casablanca.

In Casablanca, I was moved from office to office (at 12AM), with each official claiming it was someone else's responsibility. Finally, I was denied my claim and when I asked what I am to do with my baggage (I had no hotel plans or money) I was told it is my problem. He rudely dismissed me and told me to figure it out (again, 18 years old, no money, alone).

I lugged my baggage out that morning a few hours later and was carrying two big bags with me around Casablanca, completely ruining my experience.

This doesn't even cover the fact that Royal Air Maroc has terrible in-flight conditions, bad entertainment, and rude service at every turn. Complete joke.

"Not all of their tablets were working properly. The plug in connection also didn't work properly in a couple and I was constantly adjusting it so I could properly hear whatever I was watching. Frankly, the only entertainment in a 9h flight and it's faulty.

I was lucky to meet ONE very polite and dear flight attendant who was very nice and compensated for the indifference of all others. Unfortunately, he explained to me they travel all over the globe and I cannot remember his name, or I would definitely praise his service. All the rest of the flight attendants didn't care much about hosting the passengers or even treating them friendly, but I guess that seems to be a pattern when it comes to international flights in general.

The food is average, but somewhat plenty. There's a lot to snack after the small meal. I'm a pescatarian and tried their vegetarian meal yet didn't like it. They opt for things too hard to digest and I felt extremely under the weather through half of the flight. I changed it online for the return flight, but when I got to the plane, no change was requested and they wanted to serve me the vegetarian again. The nice flight attendant I mentioned was very kind, made no big deal about it and offered me the regular meal instead.

The seats are as usual - never too comfortable when you're traveling for 8-9h straight. They give socks though, which helps when it gets too cold.

Now, as most people, I had to get a connecting flight to/from Casablanca. Everything there is quite messy and I didn't like the experience. Going to Rio, we had to RUN to board our flight because we hadn't even landed and our next plane was already boarding passengers. There's no AC and it was extremely hot. Coming back, we also faced a huge queue and had to wait in the sun for about 15min for the bus to take us to the plane.

Flight attendants change to the extreme when we're on short flights and the flight from/to Porto was quite pleasant.

Asked the agents , they did not have a name of A SUPERVISOR.They kept sending me back and forth from RAM agency and counter number 1 for hours, but no help!!!

"I have never been on flight as bad as this. It was delayed total of 7 hours! Once we got to Casablanca  for our transient flight, we were met with further delays, a journey that was meant to take 2 hours at most included the wait, took further 4 hours. No explanation was given, the people at the desk were terribly rude, hard to communicate, they only spoke French and did not translate for the rest of the customers who spoke other languages, which is not ideal as most people were in the dark about what was going. The flight attendant were inadequate and rude. Luckily our stay in Agadir. Furthermore, there was NO flight entertainment!I will never fly this company and neither will my family, friends!

"I flew Royal Air Maroc from New York to Casablanca on a business trip. When I arrived in Casablanca, my luggage was not there. It was extremely difficult to file a claim as it was very hard to communicate with the Baggage Service Person had very little English.  For the whole week that I was there, I kept calling and they could not give me any information. After 3 days with out clothes, I was forced to purchase a few clothes and a bag as I was travelling to different cities.  When I returned to the States I contacted their Customer Service in Casablanca. I ran into agents who said they did not speak English and refused to talk to me. When I did finally get a person who could talk to me, she called me a liar as she knew I picked up my bag when I arrived. I stopped dealing with them and for the next 27 days I only talked to JFK customer service who searched for my bag. Finally after a month, it was found in Morocco and sent back to JFK where it was finally delivered on the 34th day.  Then began the attempt to get back the $248 that I had spent for supplies and a year later nothing, they just stopped talking to me.

"Me and my boyfriend flew with Royal air Maroc at the start of September and were very pleasantly surprised. We were quite weary initially because the reviews are so poor however we can’t fault this flight at all plus it was the only flight from MAN to CASABLANCA we could get.

The flight was three and a half hours and we were surprised we got a meal. Ryan air or easyJet certainly doing five meals or for short haul flights! My boyfriend had chicken and cous cous and it was excellent and we were also offered a free soft drink. I don’t have the food on planes but the air host told me if I wanted anything at all, to press the call bell and he would get me something later on if I wanted.

The seats were comfortable, not like the plastic ones you now see on short haul airlines. They had plenty of leg room and the staff were all very polite.

We were both very surprised given that the reviews were so bad. I would fly with Royal air Maroc again. The que for checking in was short and there were no problems with bags like most of the reviews say.

"Ha! I read reviews like ‘bad service’ and ‘flight delays’, and although I agree with all of these, we almost died on Air Morocco! We were travelling on flight AT997 on 6/9/2018 from Porto to Casablanca when the left engine literally exploded whilst we were flying. The aircraft dropped, the screens went up (so we couldn’t see how quickly!) and passengers were left panicking. The crew had no idea what was going on and did little to calm passengers who understandably were freaking out. Passengers were crying, praying and panicking. Several things were said over the intercom, but few were translated to English or Portuguese, leaving many passengers unaware that the plane was going to have to execute an emergency landing back in Porto. Thankfully we had some kind Moroccans nearby who translated for us.
To the pilots credit he managed to land the damaged plane. The only positive thing about the airline, we did have a competent pilot.
When safely on the ground there was NO information provided around what was happening. They left us stranded in an empty terminal with no water. Many people were crying, including myself and swearing never to get on a plane again. Finally (after approx 1.5 hrs) they told us the flight was ‘cancelled’ (well duh) and then we were told to line up at the upstairs counter where 2 customer service reps who were both EXTREMELY RUDE sorted out the 120 or so passengers who were left stranded. The lines were long and the staff rude. Many people waited hrs to be given no resolution. As for us, well there was no way I was getting back in one of their dodgey planes. They stated I would have to send an email to my original booking agent to get a refund and would not provide any written evidence as requested for our insurance company. They are in clear violation of passenger rights (information sheets provided by airport staff to the passengers). But I’m just glad to be alive!!!
We never got to Morocco, and I am now terrified of flying.
So do yourself a favour, don’t fly with them if you want to get to the other side, and if you have ever had a flight cancelled by them because the aircraft never arrived, it’s probably because the aircraft was unsafe to fly!!!",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YollyJ,Yolly J wrote a review Sep 2018,Yolly J,Brisbane,4 contributions,6 helpful votes,Porto - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r618345104-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"UNSAFE AIRLINE.

"I have flown the worlds best airlines and until now, I though that I had experienced the worst - wrong - only post my Royal Air Maroc experience to and from Casablanca this month have I finally traveled on the world's worst (of course this is MY opinion) airline.

Boarding gate changes.

Filthy Aircraft.

A very UNPLEASANT crew. Now I know that you could hit a bum crew on any one leg of a journey but in BOTH direftions is highly improbable. Not with Royal Air Maroc. Just miserable and unpleasant uncaring crew. I am also well aware that crew are there primarily for SAFETY issues and NOT serving .... but since you do serve, and sonce you were not forced into your position by gun point, at least do it with a smile - or try at least.

In-flight, aircraft do become dirty from uncaring passengers but usually the crew does a light clean - particularly in the lavatories. Not on RAM - the toilets are filthy 60-minutes into the flight and so do they remain until you disembark.

Audio (for PA announcements) is not good at all and the hold of English is not at all audible (again, my experience) - then get a recording for goodness sake.

The seating is shocking thanks to Boeing trying to cram more passengers in than is necessary.

Overheating in the main cabin is the norm.

And I could go on and on .... but suffice to say Morocco is a MAGNIFICENT country. It is just a great pity that their national carrier leaves much to be desired.

I'll say this. ""Thank goodness they stay up in the air.""

If you're heading to Morocco (and yes, you should be), try another carrier via an intermediary point if you must or ""grin and bear it.""",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AppreciateTravel,AppreciateTravel wrote a review Sep 2018,AppreciateTravel,"New York City, New York",28 contributions,22 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r618267961-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Nothing Dreamy about the DREAMLINER - well at least RAM,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm currently going through a painful process in trying to track my potentially lost luggage. It has almost been a week and I have yet to receive any follow-up email from Royal Air Maroc (RAM) on a previous e-mail I sent. I'm currently working with 3rd party Global Baggage Solutions who is potentially RAM's contractor on lost/delayed luggage. They previously thought they had the correct luggage and FedEx'd to my home address only to find out it was the wrong luggage.
How hard can it be for the employee to look at the bag tag and match what I provided. Unbelievable incompetency!!

Royal Air Maroc and their lack of response has been appalling and unacceptable. Downright sucks for anyone to lose a luggage(s) of irreplaceable value, but the lack of professionalism exacerbated by lack of customer service follow-up from RAM is mind boggling appalling!

I travel a lot for work and business and RAM downright is the WORST airline company I have ever done business with!!

PS - I'd like to add that the flight attendants were great during flight.

"Let me start off with saying, you get what you pay for. This flight was way cheaper than the other ones to the destination

We have four legs- DC to Casablanca, Casablanca to Rome, Rome to Casablanca back to DC.

DC to Casablanca- no complaints, food was actually kind of good. Great start.

Casablanca to Rome- There is no decent food options in this airport but whatever, we are on our way to Italy- no biggie.

Then we boarded the plane. 1. We were in the exit row and this row was so large is was the most comfortable flying experience of my life. Twice the size of American exit rows, hooray. However, even though my purse was all the way under the seat in front of me, they made me and the people in the row move their bags. Flying to a foreign country I wasn't wild about having my passport, money and important personal belongings in a shared bin.

Then the flight attendant walks up and down the aisle spraying something. (I think air freshener?) It was like a production, multiple people on the flight were laughing at this.

Then we received the food, I could not tell what it was and took a bite and decided to pass. I ate the dinner roll they served with cream cheese. (on all future flights)

Rome- Casablanca-
Flight there was fine. We were running late because someone forgot to account for daylight savings time and everyone's flights had been adjusted two days before. We land with about 30 minutes before our next leg. Our plane was about 50% people flying to DC, we ask the flight attendant to call ahead and make sure they hold the plane. He laughs at us and tells us it's a small airport and we are being stupid.

We were not.

You get off the plane and you have to get in line for security again. There are about 250 people in line. Then over the speaker they list three flights that are departing soon to come to the front, low and behold EVERYONE in line was going to those flights so any line system was out the window and it was just survival of the fittest to get through first.

So we get through the line with at this point about 10 minutes until our flight. We then have to get into ANOTHER security line at the gate. Here they took water and items that people had just purchased from their airport. It was insane.

We were able to board but WOW was that stressful.

The mystery food was terrible on this flight, my tv keep cutting out but luckily I found some work around. My friend had a really uncomfortable exchange with the flight attendant on this flight that I wasn't apart of because I had to run (literally, see notes about time between flights) to the bathroom once we boarded the plane before take off.

Overall, I would probably never fly this airline again or if I did I would 100% bring a TON of snacks because the only food I ate after the DC to Casablanca leg was dinner rolls. It did save me a lot of money so I guess if the price is right, do it, just expect to get what you pay for.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifermD2428ZQ,Jennifer M wrote a review Sep 2018,Jennifer M,,4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Washington DC - Rome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r617626779-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Not the best,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am writing with regards to my recent experience flying with Royal Air Maroc. On August 4th my friend and I had flights booked from Tangier to Porto, Portugal with a connection in Casablanca.  When we arrived at the airport in Tangier and checked in we were informed that we were too late to board, our plane had not departed but the gate was closed.We were directed to speak with a clerk at the Air Maroc office at the Tangier airport. We waited for a few minutes for the agent to arrive at their office. We explained that we unable to board our flight and asked if there was a way we could catch our connecting flight out of Casablanca. We asked if a train or bus would get us to Casablanca in time. He suggested we take a grand taxi to be sure we made it.  He said he would email someone at the Air Maroc office in Casablanca to tell them we would be there to catch our connecting flight. We gratefully thanked him and ran to find a taxi.After a very expensive four hour taxi ride we made it to the Casablanca airport with plenty of time to check in and go through security. When we tried to check in the agent at the counter said we were not confirmed for the flight. We explained what had happened in Tangier and that an agent was going to email to confirm our connecting flight. The Casablanca airport agent directed us to go to the Air Maroc office.  We waited for about 30 minutes for an available agent. When it was our turn to speak with an agent we were told that we would have to pay a penalty for missing our first flight. I felt that missing the flight alone was a penalty; and the four hour taxi ride also penalized us, and the added expense of over 200 euros for the cost of the taxi was also a penalty that we had to endure. When I was told that we would need to pay an additional 1132.00 MAD per person, or 2264.00 MAD in total I was in shock. There was no understanding on the part of the agent of what we had gone through that day. Perhaps the agent in Tangier had not followed through with the email he said he would send on our behalf, again there seemed to us that there was no sense of understanding on either of the Air Maroc agents part.In a subsequent email that I received from Air Maroc customer relations we were thanked for our understanding when our flight AT996 from Casablanca was delayed:  We hope you have enjoyed flying with us. On behalf of Royal Air Maroc, please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused to you resulting from the delay of your flight AT996 of Aug 04th, 2018, due to operational contraints. Thank you for your understanding and look forward to having the pleasure of welcoming once again aboard! Royal Air MarocAs Air Maroc passengers we were asked for our understanding when our flight was delayed, yet we did not receive the same courtesy when we were not able to make our flight.  We were imposed with a very heavy penalty - how is that understanding??  I am extremely upset with how the agent treated us, his lack of understanding and by the harsh penalty that we had to pay.  I feel that the penalty we had to pay should be fully refunded.  In all my years of travel I have never been treated with such harsh measures by any other airline. I have sent Royal Air Maroc my concerns and received a reply that stated because I had purchased my ticket from a website other than Royal Air Maroc's that I was directed to contact the online agency I used to purchase my ticket. I replied by stating that my concern was not with the purchase of my ticket through the website other than Royal Air Maroc. My concern was with the harsh financial penalty imposed on me in order to catch my connecting flight by the Royal Air Maroc agent at the Casablanca Airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiamo3,Tiamo3 wrote a review Sep 2018,Tiamo3,"Summerland, Canada",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Tangier - Porto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r617492469-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Harsh penalty for missing a flight,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This airline has the worse customer service I've ever experienced.  Our flight from NY to Casablanca was great.  However, the return trip from Marrakech was a nightmare.  Flight cancellations out of Casablanca, leaving us stranded at the airport overnight.  The customer service agents refused to assist us.  One of them even told us that it wasn't his problem that our flight had been canceled and that we were stranded at the airport.  Just all around poor customer service that didn't end until we landed in Washington DC (instead of JFK) - and the airline once again left all of their passengers, who were supposed to be in NY, stranded with no information and no help on how to get back to our destination.

"I was notified by mail that my flight back home had been canceled due to operational reasons. I was offered a flight 2 days later.
So far so good, normally an airline will support you now by either offering an connection flight or accommodation.
So I called the hotline hoping to get some support, because I had nowhere to stay. Only option offered was a flight to Berlin one day later. A connection to Munich is „not our problem, we are just the hotline“. Asking for a hotel to stay the two days in Morocco they again replied „not our problem we are just the hotline, you can send an email to customer support“.
So I sent an E-Mail:
Answered one day later: „thank you for your mail, we will try to respond to your mail in the next 60 days“

"To start our adventure, we found the seat pillows and seats covered in blood and crumbs from the prior passengers. The flight attendants were completely uninterested in assisting us to sanitize the seats or find new ones. They later claimed the blood was chocolate. This airline should only be flown in a hazmat suit.

To top it off, the food was inedible and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable.

And finally, there is no mechanism for cheap economy to business class upgrades. Literally, on United you can upgrade mid-flight but with Royal Air Maroc, there is no such mechanism at the airport or otherwise.

"There are very few options that fly direct from Barcelona to Casablanca, and Royal Air Maroc is probably the only one. The flight itself was very basic (no entertainment system, snacks but no hot meal, older plane) but the experience itself was a smooth one - no major delays, no lost luggage, no major turbulence.

Lines at immigration in Casablanca were relatively short and the wait for luggage to arrive at the carousels were reasonable. There are a few places for you to buy a SIM card and exchange money but very little dining options at the airport.

"I wouldn't rate anything better than an average 2, but I Loved It !
Checking was chaotic, the few western travelers were extra searched. So I got a feel for how it feels for many in North America. Then one simply follows the que, where you are then bused out to a large 747 - one of the very few that still cross the Atlantic.
Inside,seats don't really adjust, the reading lights are burned out or off, there is no onboard entertainment ( at least not the type that we are used to).
It wasn't a cheap flight either. That said, I booked very close to our travel and there were no other flights home on my travel day, even through Europe.
That all said, it was highly enjoyable.
There were so many kids on board, it reminded me of a kids birthday party. And they were wild; running around, jumping on the seats, crying.
It was the human experience. The conversation was open with the other passengers - strangers quickly became friends.
And there was full service, when there was turbulence, service continued - none of this "" sorry we need to put everything away and not serve hot coffee""

"Flew with RAM for the 1st time as they had the cheapest price by more than $400 on similar flights from YYZ /YUL to FIH. Plane was on time,took a bit of time to board as plane was full families with younger kids. Plane had just landed from Casablanca and in less than one hour we were boarding that plane so cleanness was not up to standard and had to clean my seat and tray using wipes. You receive socks and sleep mask. For the food ,I wish they could have food items that are more appealing to their diverse customers. LuggagesI heard of the horror stories of the company losing their passenger luggage . I was even more nervous as I forgot to lock of one my suitcases. The Casablanca layover was ok , I was given a room since I had 11 hours until my next flight. Room was only use  to refresh myself to go explore the Medina. Please keep in mind that it takes almost  1 hour train ride each way from the airport to Casaport. (Cost is close to 6 Cad each way). I only had a 1 h 30 min to shop and make it on time back to the hotel to get my stuff and head back to the airport using the hotel shuttle. Arrival at destination,both my luggages were wrapped and not done by me. I was already freaking out that my suitcase was unlocked so maybe items were removed before being  wrapped. Some of my fellows passengers noticed that their suitcases which were locked were open and the lock was missing but they too were wrapped. One told us that on his way to Europe some of his items were stolen and he was going to file a complaint and wanted to have the contact of other fellow passengers who had experienced the same thing.  Final verdict I don’t think  I will fly with this company again unless the price is extremely extremely low and I am not carrying items that I will miss if they get stolen.

"I am not an airline expert but I have used 10+ airlines in the past 4 years between major ones and budget ones. RAM gave me one of the worst experiences by far.

I have to mention the pros first, however few. Courteous cabin crew. They were very polite compared to other airlines. They handed out toys for kids and were kind to replace my son’s toy as it was for younger age group. Above average leg room. Frequent water and drinks. Sky RAM is a WiFi service to run multimedia entertainment on your laptop or so. However I failed to run it on my iPhone. But still is a very good idea if the plane has no built in entertainment facilities.

Now to the other side of the story. I booked CAI-LHR flight with 1 hour transit in Casablanca. First of all, they told me the first flight will be handled by Egyptair and they are not responsible for online check in for the first flight. Fine by me!!! Got the first boarding pass in Cairo and the flight was smooth (20 minutes late) in a standard 737 narrow body aircraft with usual EA service (I will review EA on their page as well).

Landed in Casablanca to the chaotic RAM desk. They were astonished we had 5 bags (me, my wife and my son!!!!) and that they need to transfer them from the first plane to the other. Anyway, I received the boarding passes 35 minutes before the flight and managed to catch it to find myself and my family in nothing short of a dirty 737 narrow body aircraft with questionable stains all over the seats and the walls, very noisy aircraft (remember I was on another 737 just 50 minutes earlier) and CRT Monitors!!!! (for those born in the new millennium, that’s the ancient large TV version before the LCD era).

We survived the trip to find half of our luggage missing at London Heathrow airport.

I booked that flight since it was cheaper by 300 £ compared to a direct one and since RAM had very good ratings among African airlines but I couldn’t be more wrong.

Definitely not an experience I would like to repeat or recommend for anyone. I am still waiting to hear about the rest of my luggage.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MhmdAtef,MhmdAtef wrote a review Aug 2018,MhmdAtef,"Southampton, United Kingdom",228 contributions,31 helpful votes,Cairo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r611995776-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Very bad,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Curious about the service and choice of food I found myself wondering about the way things are handled at Royal Air Maroc... No consistency in serving the meal on the left and right side, the choice only chicken or beef, no vegetarian option ( which I was looking for), coffee or tea is served walking with the pot in the cabin crew's hand – like in old times...where is the milk or sugar ? You have to ask for and it is brought in a big plastic bag from which it gets distributed to those who are claiming it.
Water !! On Royal Air Maroc one cabin crew comes with a pile of cups and a big bottle of water and serves those who claim. I always thought water and hydrating yourself on a plane is one of the most important things! Well, at Royal Air Maroc is is a luxury.
The snack which was served in the second part of the flight was on a wet tray, no drink was on the tray, nobody passed by with a trolley to offer any drink and then the cabin crew disappeared.
When rolling their carts through the alley they could not manage to roll them straight and bumped into the passengers sitting on the aisle seats every time they passed.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/453karinl,453karinl wrote a review Aug 2018,453karinl,"Doha, Qatar",27 contributions,47 helpful votes,Casablanca - Doha,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r611842496-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Bad service,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"FLying from Montreal to Lebanon. Trip was updated and then delayed one day ! No clear information was given from company regarding the connection trip. So we flew me and my 13 years old son on Saturday June 23rd instead of June 22nd (Our main scheduled date). At the YUL airport i asked the agent about the flight that will take us from Casablanca to Beirut and his answer was YOU WILL MISS THE FLIGHT and that they managed to give us a different destination as soon as we get to Morocco. We agreed as we dont have any other choices. Saturday afternoon we arrived to Casablanca where we found the worst treatment ever from RAM management to the customer service and even the baggage service. No one had any lists of passengers names and schedules. No communication was done internally between Montreal and Casablanca to inform them about the situation. We were forced to stay for two nights in a hell of a hotel until Monday morning. Vacation ruined, stressful situations for three days and bad treatment.

"They love the euro currency, in fact it starts at Customs after the passport control they ask you if you have euros with you even when you live the country, what's that supposed to mean? Even if I have euros with me this is my money, I am  European after all! Why they ask that? The duty free it's all in euro and you won't believe this but the prices of cafes and restaurants are even more expensive then in Europe! Let's get back to the airport, when you get in the country you have to fill il the custom form, exactly the same if you live the  country, this is ridiculous because the forms are exactly the same and is just wasting time, they increase airport prices and flight tickets but they cannot invest in better systems nor in english speaking personnel ?The customs forms are available once you get off the plane in the passport control area, why not in the plane in order to avoid CHAOS? This is what we call a 3rd world country, not only for the poverty, corruption and more but also because their systems failures.

"RAM took off delayed 2hours from Marseille making us miss our connection. I was travelling with my 5yo child. The moment we arrived at the airport I approached the help desk to inform them my flight passed already. Not even an apologetic word, all I received was a question of what do I need from her. I asked for their procedure as it was the airlines fault. The lady told me to go outside - proceed pass the immigration and to find an office  “Hébergement” which will handle my case. This was quite worrisome and doubtful as no document whatsoever was given. I asked if they will provide a place to sleep & meals. She told me yes all will be provided. Again, I arrived at the office and the man on the desk was on the phone. Not even a hello, he just gestured me to pass him my boarding pass while continuously talking on the phone. Gave me a printout and told me to go out the airport to take a bus that will bring us to a hotel. No polite words given. No greetings, no sorry, no goodbyes. It’s like you are ordered by your master & the fact you are there in front of them irritates them and you have to leave fast with their hand gesture. In the hotel provided (Relax), the bedsheets were unchanged. No pillowcases. You still see the remnants of the one who used the bed before & also some hairs. No towels too. And no drinks. Apparently they don’t offer drinks. I was told that this is the agreement between RAM and the hotel and nothing can be done.

"On a recent visit to Morocco, I received an email two days before my departure that Royal Air Maroc CANCELLED my return flight. The only option they gave me to rebook was to leave at 5AM the next morning.

As someone who carefully plans and looks forward to a vacation once a year, I was infuriated when I had to end my trip two days early in order to get home! To make matters worse, I was in Marrakech when this was thrown at me, and had to spend the rest of that day scrambling to take a 3 hour/$200 USD taxi to get to the airport in another city, not to mention the hotels for two nights I had paid in advance that I didn’t even get to stay at.

Good luck seeking any sort of retribution from them - what a JOKE! I have tried to ask the airline to compensate me for some of the costs accrued as a result of this cancellation - if you do get to speak to someone they’re horrifically rude and condescending. If you aren’t lucky enough to reach an actual person you’re redirected in an endless maze of dead ends and suggestions to “file a claim online.”

"We were not notified of a six hour delay in departure when we checked in online. When we checked in at the airport we were informed at that time, but too late to have been able to stay at our hotel without wasting time at the airport.

We only received an email apologizing for the delay after showing up at the airport many hours earlier than we needed to. No apology was given.

The wait at the airport service counter was interminable, and the desk staff were rude, inconsiderate and uncaring. We were told we could get a hotel voucher, but when we went to the place designated to receive it, they denied that such a service existed.

Despite empty gates at the terminal, we were forced to take a bus and carry our luggage up stairs into the aircraft at boarding time. I suspect that the airline placed its plane on the tarmac, as often done in Third World countries, to save money on airport fees charged to use a gate.

This was a great inconvenience to us older passengers who found it difficult to carry the luggage up the steps. Of course, the airline offered no help in that, either.

In the air, flight attendants were uncaring, rushed through their chores so that they could talk with each other, and offered little service to customers in the overcrowded plane. For example, only once during the long flight was water offered to passengers.

The airplane bathrooms were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight. Only toilet tissue was available to dry your hands after washing.

The food, like most international airlines nowadays, was barely edible. This is the one area that Royal Air Maroc equaled other carriers.

In summary, this airline offers Third World services fitting for a Third World country.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redfoot,Redfoot wrote a review Aug 2018,Redfoot,"Sun City, Arizona",385 contributions,228 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r606600403-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Uncaring.

"I have never faced such an improper way of treating passengers!
I'm staying in KSA and my Family staying in Jordan, we planned to spend Eid Holiday in Istanbul together, I booked their round-trip tickets from Amman / Jordan to Istanbul Departing on August 17, 2018 returns in August 24, 2018 in order to arrange my flight accordingly and then reserve a car and make a hotel booking as well, I received a confirmation email from Royal Maroc then I executed my plan.
The flight ticket for me was very expensive so I reserved a non-refundable ticket to save some money which cost me $891 then I proceeded with car and hotel reservation which was as well non-refundable.
I have done my 5 family members reservations through Expedia paying the total amount of $1088 and received the confirmation on August 3, 2018, as It is high season these days and prices increases every minute.
August 7, 2018, I received an email for each ticket mentioning simply that tickets for these flights are not valid any more due to computer bug!!! I tried immediately to contact Royal Maroc call centre but they are not answering!!!
I contacted Expedia call centre which is located in the US discovering that they have no idea about this!!! I spend 2 days between the agents and supervisors until they confirmed for me that the trip is cancelled and that they started already the refunding process and they can’t do anything about it!!! I tried to find another flight but the price becomes more than triple. So, I had 2 options: either I cancel the whole plan and lose my non-refundable ticket + Non-refundable Hotel’s reservation + my calls to Expedia call centre ($891 + $853 + $133 = $1877) or to reserve expensive tickets for my family and lose almost the same amount.

"Due to staffing problems that apparently occurred because of a strike of the crew, my flight took off 4 hours later than planned. This caused me missing my connecting flight and I had to overnight in Frankfurt. The airline organized a hotel room for me and paid for its costs, but the information flow to the passengers was absolutely horrible - we'd been waiting at the gate for 3 hours for boarding before they would tell us anything. Also, your customer service hotline is ridiculously bad. After having waited 15 minutes in the phone queue the call center agent put me on hold for another 12 minutes, and for what? To check which flight I should take after the missed connection. Please improve your communication towards your customers!

-- Long lines at every step of the process
-- Inefficient boarding process causing further delays
-- Missed connection because of delay and staff in Casablanca were frigid and unhelpful

We arrived at 8:50 am, and asked and were told we were given a downtown hotel for our wait.  That was fine, and we could walk to the mosque and through the old market.  The problem was the flight to Lome.  We expected it to leave at 02:40, so we knew we had a long layover.  We arrived before midnight, and were told the flight was delayed until 7 am, so sent to a closer hotel for the wait.  We arrived before 5 am and were told it was delayed until 2 pm.  At 1:30 there was no sign of any staff to board us, and no other flight to subsaharan Africa were departing.  We started to appeal to prayers back home, and to search for  a way to get to another city where other airlines were flying to Lome.  Suddenly there was activity and we boarded.

"Royal Air Maroc used to be one of my favorites. I flew with the company for the past 8 years or so, and I noticed that the service is always getting worse and worse.

Few years ago, it was one of the cleanest and relaxing airways. Whenever I wanted to go to Morocco, Royal Air Maroc was my first option, but now it became my last.

I think it can still be one of the best by improving the following aspects:

1) Train its staff to communicate better
2) Make sure that the airplane is always clean
3) Make sure that the technichal and mechanical condition of the airplane is clear before welcoming the passangers on board.

Other than the above mentioned issues, Royal Air Maroc still remains one of the most powerful airline companies.

Finally, I would like to conclude by mentioning that Royal Air Maroc is still one of the best companies when it comes to food.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hodab999,HBT wrote a review Aug 2018,HBT,,18 contributions,29 helpful votes,Rome - Tangier,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r603466010-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,I used to be a big fan..,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I purchased a plane ticket through the Royal Air Maroc website from Barcelona to New York-JFK with a layover in Casablanca. My first flight departed July 29th at 19:10. I arrived at Barcelona Airport (BCN) at 15:00 – 3 hours prior to my flight as suggested via Royal Air Maroc website. Upon reaching the check-in desk, I was informed my ticket had been cancelled and I would not be able to board.

Upon further questioning, I was told by the check-in desk the flight had been overbooked and my flight itinerary had been changed. Royal Air had moved me to an earlier flight the same day, one that departed at 13:30 - five hours earlier than my original flight. I never received an email nor an SMS of this change in schedule. The first time I heard of the change was at the check-in desk around 15:15, at which point the rescheduled flight had already departed.

I called costumer service office, asking to be rescheduled to another flight. However, I was informed that the airline was not responsible for the flight change and that the airline would not pay for another flight. They then blamed the airport, stating one of the agents at the airport changed the schedule. So if I wanted to get a new ticket, I would need to speak to the airport.

I did. No one at the airport could help, as they all stated the flight change could not be their responsibility - they do not have the authority to change someone's flight without the passenger’s direct request. I even questioned how the airport was at fault. If I booked my flight through Royal Air Maroc website, why was it not the responsibility of Royal Air Maroc, the carrier, to contact me of a flight change? And wasn’t Royal Air Maroc admitting to the flight change by saying the airlines agents changed my flight itinerary?

Royal Air Maroc refused to claim they made a mistake. The agents at the airport claimed to not have the power to make such a mistake. And I was left stranded without a flight back to the US.

I spent two days at the airport on the phone, talking to airport staff trying and failing to get rebooked or even refunded.

Honestly, I cannot understand how a paying customer can be so mis-treated. I paid for my flight, I was ready and at the airport 3 hours before I was originally scheduled to fly. And then I am informed that someone – unknown who - had changed my flight time, and that I had missed this new flight. This was completely out of my hands. Someone, please explain how this okay? How a passenger’s flight can be moved up by 5 hours without any notification? How a passenger can be expected to rebook and repay for a flight as if the mistake was her fault? How costumer service can provide little help to rectify the situation?

What I do know per the EU passenger rights and Royal Air Maroc own legal notice, I should have been given notice of a change. And as I was not, my passenger rights were violated, and I should have been compensated. I never was.

If I’ve learned anything from this ordeal, is Royal Air Maroc does not care for its passengers, they will violate passenger’s rights. All Royal Air Maroc cares about is money. The airline may appear cheaper, but the cost is not worth it. In fact, if this is the behavior they have, I do not believe Royal Air Maroc should even continue as an airline company. Please learn from my experience do not book a trip with this airline.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessarW5331IF,Vanessa R wrote a review Aug 2018,Vanessa R,,2 contributions,,Barcelona - Newark,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r603304555-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Left Stranded - Terrible Airline,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Is it possible to leave children sitting in different places?
When I spoke with one of the workers, he said it was possible to ask passengers to change place
I told him that it was not for me to ask anyone about your work
And when the dinner is he asked me you want chicken or meat
I answered chicken told me there is no chicken Possible meat I told him kids do not like meat He said to me What should I do
I told him that if you did not bring chicken to my children I would sue the company’
In a minute, bring three chicken dishes to the children
I was surprised that he told me no chickens
When I asked for a diet drink I was told no longer available

"I just got off my RAM flight. I will say there was a lot of legroom.

However, the service was extremely slow on the plane. The only flight attendant I saw working was a lone woman, the three men didn't seem to do anything. So it took forever to get a meal and the tray clean up was such a long wait I started to feel claustrophobic.

The meal was very bad. Not a single fruit or vegetable. Even the ""mango"" yogurt had no fruit, only ""aroma"".

But the real problem was the heat! I usually freeze on airplanes, so have lots of layers. This was flight was so hot I felt nauseous (the food didn't help), light headed and worried I might faint. I rang the bell multiple times but it took 10 minutes before anyone came and another 10 minutes before they brought me a glass of water. Which was lukewarm like all the other drinks, but did help.

I k ow the airplane had air conditioning because they turned it on 20 minutes before landing!! Only then did the cabin become bearable.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaoAnTian,GaoAnTian wrote a review Aug 2018,GaoAnTian,"Melbourne, Australia",210 contributions,113 helpful votes,Brussels - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r602783166-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,No Air Con!,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lagos To Casablanca trip was smooth and on time. There were light snacks on the flight. Lay over at CMN was 5 hours. We started to board for NYC about 2 hours before the time because of the crowd I believe. But we had some delays on the bus to the tarmac, we had to get off the bus  and then get on the bus again after being in the bus for about 30mins. They said technical issues. Other than that it was a smooth ride, and we got to NYC on time despite the delay in take off. We were served one proper meal and another snack meal on the flight.

"This was my third flight with the Moroccan Airlines and the worst of all flights I ever took.  I had to travel from Ottawa to Montreal then waited at the counter for more than a hour for the check-in to be surprised that the flight originally scheduled at 10:55 pm has been delayed to the next day at 11:30 am. There were other people from Toronto, Vancouver, the north... we all were informed of the delay only at the very last moment. After passing the night in hotel I headed back at very early hour to the airport. There were no sign of the delayed flight, no one to provide us with information and after insistence and demonstration of protest in the airport they finally told us the flight was delayed again til 6:30 pm.

"This was a miserable flight. There were way too many passengers flying with babies and/or small children. I understand that people have children and want/need to travel with them. I do not believe that children should be allowed to scream and carry on so loudly that it disrupts the experience of others. I also do not believe it is ok for children to kick the seats in front of them or to use the tray tables as a drum station as the child behind us was doing over and over and over. Flight attendants did absolutely nothing to improve the quality of the flight experience for adult passengers. There were several passengers who did complain and nothing was done, nothing. It was impossible to rest or to even enjoy the in-flight entertainment. Try sitting down to watch a movie and every 5 seconds, someone kicks your seat from behind or some child is literally screaming as loud as he possibly can. Our initial flight departed late from Rome - not sure why. Nothing was ever communicated to passengers. We nearly missed our connecting flight since their passport line was very long and moving way too slowly. Thankfully, the connecting flight was also delayed. Again, not sure why. This airline communicates poorly or not even at all. Food was decent, but nothing to write home about. Touchscreen was obviously new, which was nice since that meant it was quick and very responsive unlike many older models. Variety of entertainment was adequate but not great. I suggest this airline do one of two things: 1 - limit the amount of passengers flying with children per flight to maintain an enjoyable atmosphere, or 2 - seat all passengers with children under 6 in an area together, possibly with some noise barriers between them and other passengers. This was one of the most miserable flight experiences I have ever had and I have taken many long, international flights on different airlines. I cannot say I would ever choose to fly with this airline again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/99/14/55/wplandry.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WPLandry,WPLandry wrote a review Aug 2018,WPLandry,"Fairfax, Virginia",517 contributions,261 helpful votes,Casablanca - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r602401731-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,LOUD flight,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Thanks to the strikes by Air France I was put on a flight from Paris to Casablanca on Royal Air Maroc (RAM). I had no choice having missed all other flight options.  My experience in getting between terminals was horrendous.   Once I got to the right terminal I used the lounge that was available for RAM.  It was acceptable but not great.  I was treated poorly by the RAM agent at the gate.  I was told by Delta Airlines back in Detroit that my bags would be transferred in Paris to my RAM flight.  The RAM agent told me I had two choices because my bags were not transferred and were never going to be transferred in the first place.  My choices:  get on the plane without my bag and deal with it in Casablanca or don’t get on this flight (the last one of the day) and go find my bag at Air France.  She was rude and made me cry.  I was traveling alone and I was traveling Business Class.  Her supervisor observed what was going on and stepped in and said he’d check on my bag.  No luck.  On the flight I was one of only two passengers in First Class.  The flight attendant was very pleasant and we struggled a bit to communicate as I do not speak much French and she spoke no English.  But no big deal.  I was the foreigner.  She served me a glass of nice French champagne albeit warm.   The dinner was awful but for dessert I had the most wonderful French cheese course.  Once I landed in Casablanca I had to go thru the process for lost luggage with the airport representative who was not a RAM employee.  In the end I was just happy to finally get to Casablanca!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/91/28/32/deborah-t.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/357DeborahT,Deborah T wrote a review Aug 2018,Deborah T,"Chicago, Illinois",1126 contributions,1326 helpful votes,Paris - Casablanca,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r602078204-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Unplanned Flight from Paris to Casablanca due to Air France Strikes,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked a lot with RAM and price was always higher then other airlines, but quality good..until now 2 years we have the same extremely bad experiences.
we booked 4 months in advance..1 month before our departure they informed us that they need to change our flights..the only alternative was to move to ""uncomfortable"" flight hours and...afterwards they informed us that the flight will be covered by another airline Nouvelair (tunesian company)...once in the plane..old and cracky....dirty..completely disguisting...I made the remark to the steward, but he waved it away as...""so what - cant do anything about it..he gave me a tissue to clean the table"".
the food was from RAM and was good....that is the only ""good"" thing.
ooh yea we had 3.5 hours delay....check in was wrong - steward showed us the wrong line as the flight changed and she didn't knew..so we qued twice to check in...
Another passenger made also different remarks...but stewards don't really bother..
Our flight (AT691) back was again covered by another airflight and crew (I think Polish crew) and inside the plane (again old and cracky) was very dirty...food was good. no delay.

Boarding was a bit delayed with no announcements really - but once on board, everything went smoothly. Soon after the meal was served I got a surprise. People got up from their seats, moved around and started chatting everywhere.

It was a struggle to get any other airline as the choice is limited but in no way did I expect the flights to be as awful as they were.

"My family and I flew Royal Air Maroc on our way to Rome for a cruise. We had a layover in Morocco. It unfortunately was not an enjoyable flight and caused stress. The flight was delayed three times prior to travel. It was an overnight flights, but they kept the lights on the entire time and the passengers were unruly. Flight attendants could not be bothered to help you, even if you put your service light on. When they did (if they did) they were short and rude. The plane was not clean, especially the bathroom, with no paper towels to dry your hands. Trash was thrown all throughout the aisles. I'm not sure if this was attributed to the passengers or the crew, but regardless, it was filthy. Two women got in a screaming match for about 15 minutes and with 5 flight attendants present, it didn't seem like they did much to quell the altercation. After our lay-over in Morocco, the flight was again delayed and the boarding process was incredibly disorganized and again was staffed with unkind crew members. Needless to say we were kissing the ground when we made it to Rome!

On our flight back to Washington, D.C., we went in with an open mind, hoping it would be a better flight. The passengers were much calmer this time, but the staff were once again poor representations of the airline. Asking for a simple cup of water was met with huffing and puffing and eye rolls. I turned my service light on, because my screen was not working and it took them an hour to come. This was after trying to get several crew members attention and being deliberately ignored. The seven hour flight was spent sitting with nothing to do as the flight was fully booked. The aisles were once again filled with trash and the bathrooms left uncleaned. I truly hope others have had a better experience- hopefully we were met with a bout of bad luck!

"THIS AIRLINE IS A COMPLETE SCAM.

Don’t fly Royal Air Maroc unless you want to be screwed over at 10 o’clock at night and get trapped in Morocco.

Was checking into my flight from Casablanca to NY JFK when the woman at the counter said I had a standby ticket (which I 100% did not). I explained to her that I had a real seared ticket, to which she said she was going to call a manager and print out my boarding pass.

Fifteen minutes go by and a man walked up to me to inform me that the flight check in has been closed and I cannot fly home to New York. The woman at the counter waited until the time ran out to check in so she wouldn’t have to bother getting me a seat on the plane. I was told that I missed the flight and I needed to reschedule my trip back to NY. She didn’t take the responsibility for trapping me in this country and now I’m probably going to have to pay for another flight to New York.

"There are pros and cons of flying with Royal Air Maroc. The pros include the price, new aircraft, and a safe flight. The cons are limited customer service due to nonchalant attitudes, at times inconsistent, and limited entertainment on the television. However, since the flight was significantly less than its competitors, we received what we paid for. The airline does offer an option to check in online, but I do not recommend, as you will need for a gate agent to print a boarding pass. This is what we did, but the problem was that the agent didn't come to the gate until it was time to board.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdl07c,Christina Lynch wrote a review Jul 2018,Christina Lynch,"Tallahassee, Florida",519 contributions,74 helpful votes,Washington DC - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r595415559-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Pretty Decent, But Avoid Customer Service Needs",Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Being a moroccan, I have taken Royal Air Maroc my whole life to go visit from Montreal to Casa. Personally I am not fond of this company but I am used to it.
Just to sumarize my point of view of this airline:
Cons:
1- Bad customer service, you have to ask 2-3 times before you get something from an attendant (they are often rude)
2-Food doesn't taste super good (worse than hospital food), and it is often repetitive between the different meals.
3- Plane ALWAYS late! whether it is in the leaving or return flight..
4-People on the plane are often loud (families with their kids) and people always ask you for stuff (whether to hold something for them or to switch seats, which is okay but several times is annoying when u wanna travel solo and calmly).

Pros:
1- You have tablets with movies, music etc.
2-The food is free
3- You get to have 2 registered luggages of 23kg+ a small cabin luggage
4-The aircraft pilots are usually reputed

"This 6AM flight from Fes to Casablanca is a SCAM, be aware.  Mine was canceled after getting up at 3:30AM and arriving at 4:30AM in the morning with no prior notice.  Weather was fine, there were other flights leaving around the same time. They cancel the flight often, the local person told me this was the 3rd time they canceled this flight on him.  They put everyone on a bus to Casablanca and did not offer you a refund.  Just so you know, a bus is 10 times cheaper than a flight and takes 3.5 hrs to the Casablanca airport.  I asked for a letter stating that they canceled the flight for my insurance, but this couldn't be done after waiting for 30 min.  The system never shows the flight being canceled.

"Firstly, I would like to mention that I am not one to write reviews. I must be completely wowed and the service must exceed my expectations or I must be extremely disappointed with the service. In this case I have never experienced service that was this awful. I am amazed that an airline such as Royal Air Maroc is still in business. I have traveled a lot in Europe, Asia, North & South America and I can confidently say this is the worst airline I have ever used. They lack the first principal of an airline company, customer service. When I traveled from JFK (NY) to Fes via Casablanca I was only given my boarding pass from JFK to CMN. When at Casablanca I had to search for assistance as to wear I could get my boarding pass from Casablanca to Fes. We finally found the area and were quickly amazed by the chaos. There were 2 customer service reps for about 25 people. Yelling quickly began among passengers as many of them were about to miss their connecting flight. After waiting about 1 hour in line we finally got our boarding pass. It become quickly clear that the staff we not eager to assist and also lacked training. We finally arrive in Fes but my bag stayed in Casablanca. We quickly found out that Royal Air Maroc has no reps in Fes, therefore we had to deal with a third party airport service company. The customer service help was once again poor. We asked when the bag would arrive and he said probably tomorrow around the same time we had arrived. He then pointed to a bunch of lost baggage that had just arrived from Casablanca from other passengers. Once again we quickly noticed that losing customers bags were a frequent thing for Royal Air Maroc. I then proceed to give them our hotel info so that they could drop of our bag, but he stopped me and said that I would need to return to the airport and pick up my bag because Royal Air Maroc doesn't have any employees at Fes to drop of the bag. I found this extremely unprofessional as I once had a bag lost from another airline and they delivered it to my home the next day. This is actually standard for airlines to do, but not with Royal Air. Extremely disappointed I left the airport with only the clothes I was wearing. The next day I had to purchase all new clothes and all hygiene products as I was told that my bag would be available for pickup the following morning. Two days after my arrival and about 4 hours commuting to and from the airport (I had to pay out of pocket for my taxi ride) I pickup my damaged bag. On my return to the airport for my flight back to NY I tried to talk to someone from Royal Air Maroc about the incident at the airport in Marrakech (but no luck), in Casablanca (but no luck) and in NY (but no luck). In Casablanca they literally pointed me to empty offices and had me running around for over an 1 hour before telling me that no once could help me. I demanded to speak with a manager and they informed me that because it was a weekend managers do not work. 1. If that is true, then that has to be the worst company policy and a disgrace to a customer service company and 2. if that was a lie, well then, that is disgraceful. I can't stress to any fellow traveler how terrible this airline is. Do not use them, you will regret it. After reading many of the other terrible reviews for this airline I quickly noticed that my situation could have been a lot worse. I also spoke to other travelers in Morocco and they too shared their grief about flying with Royal Air Maroc. All of the comments are the same. The sad thing is that this company is not doing anything to correct the ongoing issues. The same negative reviews from years ago are still present today. Reviews are also a great way to provide the company feedback about their service and for the company to correct issues. This is non existent with this company, they do not care about customers. Please do not be drawn to Royal Air Maroc by their low cost fare, trust me that traveling with them will cost you more money, will give you aggravation and time lost during your holiday.

A few other minor things worth mentioning; in flight entertainment was intermittent throughout the entire flight from Casablanca to JFK. It worked properly for 3 hours out of the 6 hours. USB port for charging cell phone did not work. The meals were terrible, the bread was ice cold hard and the beef had more fat than meat. Staff is unfriendly and lack problem solving skills.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RafaelV285,Rafael V wrote a review Jul 2018,Rafael V,"Port Chester, New York",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,New York City - Fes,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r594722016-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Unprofessional & Lack of Customer Service - Worst Airline,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had a flight from NYC-Fes with a stop in Casablanca.
They didn’t give us a bording pass from Casablanca to Fes and the counter to get it in Casablanca was a nightmare. There were people fighting because of the craziness. No line, no organization, the people from airline looked like they were lost and could barely talk to people. The staff working there were SOOO rude and it felt they were doing us a huge favor. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!
They lost our luggage and it took us two days to get it back. They had no customer service. They make you go around and around and didn’t help us at all. They didn’t have someone at all from the airline in Fes to help us. So we had to rely on the people from the airport, which would be very hard to follow back. After two days we had to pay a round trip to go back to the airport to get our luggage cause they wouldn’t deliver and to get reimbursed from them is not even a thing... let’s not even talk about all the basic necessary that we had to buy for the days we didn’t have our luggage.

"IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOURSELF OR YOUR LOVED ONES DO NOT TAKE ROYAL AIR MAROC. Even if you hate the person your traveling with, STILL do not take Royal Air Maroc. My friend and I decided to book with this airline to save a couple hundred dollars. Little did we know that we were about to embark on the most stressful, irritating, outrageous journey of our lives.

I travel all the time, I have never had as terrible an experience as this one. What was wrong with our trip you ask? Buckle up, let me tell you a little story.

We fly out of Dulles (Washington DC) and have a layover in Casablanca before we go to Lisbon. We make it to Casablanca fine, yeah the plane had 0 entertainment options, terrible food and smelled kind of weird but whatever, we were saving some money! We have 3 hours before our next flight so we settle into a cafe to wait. We decide to go to the gate 30 minutes before boarding even starts just to find out that our flight has already departed. WHAT DO YOU MEAN OUR FLIGHT HAS DEPARTED? WE ARRIVED BEFORE BOARDING EVEN STARTED. They briefly say something about how they follow a different time zone because of a special day light savings or something and how our phones have reverted to the wrong time. We thought it was 3:30pm but it was really 4:30pm. Confused and shocked we asked how we fix this and of course no one even gave us the time of day. As my friend and I start to panic we go to information to see how we can book a new flight. First off, I'd like to say there is maybe one SINGULAR clock inside of this airport and our phones reverted to Casablanca, Moroccan time so of course we thought our phones were correct. It felt like a twilight zone, as we're rushing around trying to figure out our plan we hear other people being confused about the time/missing their flights. We were bounced from person to person trying to figure out how to get new tickets. We finally realize we are going to have to exit the airport to get to the Royal Air Maroc office to book new ones. We also don't have any service and the wifi has timed out on us.

To exit we have to go through the immigration line, we get into it. 2 hours later we are still not close to the front of the line. At one point people are so frustrated with how slowly the line is moving a small riot breaks out and I think about how I don't even have service to text my loved ones to tell them I died in an airport mob. By this time, we had missed all other flights flying to Portugal that day. Fantastic. A nice guy in line, looks up with his wifi that there is a flight leaving from Casablanca to Portugal tomorrow morning at 9am and that it is $115.

Once we finally make it out of immigration we get to search for the Royal Air Maroc office, how fun! An hour later, we stumble upon it even though everyone has directed us 800 other places. We step in line, we hear everyone saying they've missed flights etc etc. A girl comes up to us from Zambia and tells us she's been stuck in the airport for TWO DAYS and they won't let her book a new flight home. I felt like we were in a Zombie Apocalypse movie. Once we get to talk to someone they say that our new flight will cost $300 completely trying to rip us off. Confused since we had just looked up the price, we argue with the person ""helping"" us but we don't have service and can't pull up any proof. He basically says to us ""this will be the only way you leave Casablanca"". So yes, we bought the flights.

He tells us, we can't check in until 3 hours before our flight but if we wanted we could leave and stay at a hotel and come back but we'd be paying for a room for only a couple hours. That's right folks, we slept outside the check in area on the floor of the Casablanca airport. He mentioned we should go look for my checked in luggage at the lost baggage office. We asked why and where and he refused to answer either question.

We finally get to lost luggage area and there is a group of people collectively FUMING. They tell us to wait and that they'll try and locate my luggage. After a couple of hours of going back and forth saying that it made it to Lisbon or that it is still here in the airport they finally pull my bag out of who the f knows and give it back to me. Shouldn't they have known where my bag was the whole time? Isn't that the point of having the bar code and tracking number? Im sure some of those poor folks never got their luggage and I was one of the lucky ones.

My friend and I make camp outside of check in and begin to wait. As we are laying there, many others start to join us. Have we all been stranded here in Casablanca? I felt like we were beginning a community of squatters.

Fast forward, we make it to Lisbon. On our last day we decide to go to the airport with 4 extra hours to spare. Good thing we did because when we got there the line for checking in baggage was 40 people deep and there was NO ONE WORKING ANY OF THE CHECK IN DESKS FOR ROYAL AIR MAROC. An hour later, we are still in line. My friend and I have checked in using one of those stands for our first leg but there is an error checking in to the second leg from Casablanca home. Terrified and traumatized from our first experience we decide to book a completely new, direct flight with a direct airline even if it's going to cost us so much extra $$. Good thing we did because our flight from Casablanca to Dulles got delayed by a FULL DAY for ""operational constraints"".

I feel bad even complaining this much, after reading other people's reviews I now see we could have had it even worse.

"So many terrible experiences with Royal Air Maroc. We had issues with both our flight from Dulles (Washington DC) to Lisbon and back. We were stranded in the Casablanca airport for over 24 hours with very limited/expired WiFi service and no international data capabilities. Royal Air Maroc staff was nonexistent, with empty service desks all over the airport, and when you do find a staff member you receive inconsistent responses on how to do simple actions like find luggage or reschedule a missed flight. I feel as though I was robbed by Royal Air Maroc, forced to pay $310 after missing my connection flight, missed the first few days of a non refundable trip, and felt unsafe being locked out of airport security over night. DO NOT FLY THEM.

Because of the issues we had arriving to Lisbon, for our return flight a week later we got to the airport 4.5 hours early just to be safe and ensure everything would go smoothly. When we went to check into our flights (LIS - CMN) and (CMN - IAD) we had a very bad feeling when we were unable to check in and print our boarding pass for the 2nd leg of our trip, CMN - IAD. This worried us because we only had a 2 hour layover and knew that the check in area to print boarding passes would be impossible to get through plus security and make the layover flight.

We had such a bad feeling that while in the Royal Air Maroc luggage check line, we decided to buy a $1200 TAP Portugal direct flight into JFK. Thank god we did because it doesn’t seem like the second leg of the flight had ever planned on departing on July 1st and was moved to July 2nd due to “operational constraints.” As I’m writing this review my original plane has still not landed in the states.

I fly frequently for business and leisure and have never had strong feelings against any airline (everyone can understand an occasional lost bag or cancellation.) I am actually shocked that Royal Air Maroc is still in business and will make sure I do not let anyone I have ever met fly with them. They consistently are unresponsive in person, over the phone, and online with issues and are unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful. In CMN, they do not use a speaker system to announce flight changes or updates, do not have working clocks with local time around the airport, and do a day light savings time that is not consistent with the timezone that causes many people to show up for their flights an hour late.

"Absolutely do NOT book a flight with this dreadful company. The customer service is atrocious, the staff haven't got a clue what they are doing and were rude, patronising and so unhelpful and stupid we actually missed our flight. You couldn't pay me all the money in the world to fly Royal Air Maroc. The manager refused to even leave his office when we politely asked repeatedly to speak with him and instead kept up waiting 3 hours, repeatedly telling other staff he would be out soon, before telling them he refused and wasn't coming after all. Disgusting company. Staff at check-in in desk were so unhelpful and refused to give their names.

"Don’t choose this airline just because the flight is cheaper.  It’s cheaper because it’s an older airplane, your connection in Casablanca most likely will be missed because this is THE most unorganized airline.  You’re plane will be parked miles away from the airport, you’ll have to walk up and down stairs to enter/exit the plane and then you’ll have to take a bus to get to the terminal.  NOTHING is easy with RAM.Truth be told, we chose Royal Air Maroc because awhile back they had the Dreamliner between Rio to Casablanca which we flew and we were blown away because everything was shiny & new.  After the Olympics they must have moved the Dreamliner to Toronto or NYC.  The plane now is filthy and some (not all) flight attendants took great pride in treating their customers like dirt.

"I have flown Royal Air Maroc for a couple years and I fly them every 2 to 3 months. I joined their frequent flier program and after about 7 or 8 flights, I was up to Silver and zoomed up to Gold within a month. The IAD-CAS Dreamliner is a good flight - good plane, usually not full so you might be able to lie down, and the food is fine. The only problem is the in-flight entertainment - they seem to only rotate the selection every 6 months, so for me I need to bring other forms of entertainment. Also note, you can get wine even though it is not shown on the cart - just ask for it and they can get it. The shorter CAS-TUN flight is OK, but for 2.5 hours it doesn't really matter. I've never had a problem. The only hiccup I've ever experienced was my suitcase was left in CAS and when I arrived in IAD it was not there - I panicked but it did come to me after 5 days and the IAD baggage fellow was very nice.

I also fly business by upgrading each time, which I do recommend for the IAD-CAS Dreamliner flight. This is their highest tier and you get a flat bed with a full meal service (cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, cheese, etc.). They aren't the world's highest trained flight attendants, so it's a bit hit or miss, but generally good.

Once in CAS, try to get in their lounge...the airport needs work, so the lounge is the best bet, though can be crowded. Their food is good, too.

I would recommend this airline - they have improved quite a bit in the past 5 years and seem to keep trying to improve. The IAD-CAS flight is great.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2b/75/44/nibblingnomad.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NibblingNomad,NibblingNomad wrote a review Jun 2018,NibblingNomad,Malta,72 contributions,21 helpful votes,Washington DC - Tunis,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r590213008-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"For me, this is a good airline",Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"At first glance the airline seems to be like any other budget airline. However, upon entering the plane and settling in the faults begin to show. First of all, some of the staff seemed unaware of regular airline procedures, which being a nervous flyer did not put me at ease. Furthermore, what was very evident was the state of the planes they were either rather old or just rarely cleaned (thoroughly at least). To really top it off was the loss of our luggage, which we are still waiting to be found. This has put us in a difficult position, having to buy new clothes etc with no offer of compensation or help from the airline. In fact, they were rather nonchalant about bordering on dismissive. However, it must be said there are some features that set it apart from the regular budget airlines.

The Royal Air Maroc aircraft from London to Casablanca was dirty and in dire need of a refurbishment. The window did not close (17A) and overall the plane was not clean or up to the standard of a a flag carrier.  The food was horrible and very very small portions. Not a very good first impression but once I got out of that little dirty plane into the modern and efficient Casablanca Airport everything was fine.

"-The girl at the check-in counter for Royal Air Maroc airline at Casablanca airport (June 13 between 2:30-3pm) was absolutely rude!! (After keeping me in line for a while and then finally realizing I was anxious to check in my flight, she told me I was too late, and then simply gave me a big rolling-eye and basically asked me to go away from the counter). Then the woman at the airport agency (on the first desk next to the entrance, June 13 around 3pm) to change ticket was even more terrible and had a very bad attitude. She kept repeating ""it's your problem that you missed the flight"" when what I needed was only just some kind, comforting words because I just missed the flight!-- I told her I was delayed by my taxi driver who intentionally delayed my trip to the airport simply because I had not enough tips for him (my hotel agreed with him on 360 but he kept asking for 400 on our way, and then he stopped at a gas station to bargain with someone for 15 mins and then left without gas and drove at 30-40 mph toward the airport). Maroc or the airport should fire these staff. The airline crew was ok. But I can't believe they hire such rude, unqualified and impolite staff to work in the airport counter and ticket agency. These people successfully made my impression of Morocco one of the worst after traveling so many countries. Not a single chance I will come back ever, or let my family or friends ever travel to this country.

"This airline and its customer service is unbelievable
I’m shocked that they are still in business at all.
Is there anyone that could possibly use them twice?
Maybe people that live in Morocco for convenience otherwise I’m sure no one will fly them twice.

My flight was delayed by 5 hours in December 2017.
My family had come to pick me they arrived one hour earlier and had to stand at the airport for six hours with NO information about the delay till they saw me five hours after the designated arrival time.

My luggage did not come as if things were not already bad.
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF
AIR MAROC IN THE AIRPORT TO FILE A REPORT

I Live three hours away
I had to do another six hours the next day to retrieve my luggage.
It is now six months later I’m still trying to get EU recommended compensation of about £600.
I have sent at least 12 emails.
They don’t reply
They have an automated reply that leads nowhere.
I tried calling the voice on the other end can not not book tickets fir the airline or send an email to them requesting a response
I have done that five times.
I eventually got an email stating they would pay the money within 4-6 weeks.
That was eight weeks ago.

I’m back to calling every day.
I have called Monday, Tuesday , Wednesday and today Friday.
I resume again tomorrow.

Regarding my delayed baggage they have asked for documentation to provide compensation.
Did she say earlier there was not a single soul at the airport on arrival?

Bad bad bad airline ......
Don’t use it.

Meanwhile officials at air Maroc though I’ll never fly you again nor let anyone I know fly air maroc please give me my compensation.

"This is by far the worst airline I could have picked. The airline wasn’t even able to combine my two reservations for the same day connecting via Casablanca. The excuse they gave me was “ Our system does not allow that”. You’ve got to be kidding me! My flight from Porto to Casablanca was booked separately and the one from Casablanca to Washington had a separate confirmation #. Three days prior to my departure they sent an email stating that due to a time zone change, the flight from Washington would be departing 1 hour early at 3:30 PM instead of 4:30 PM. Time zone change in June? Seriously? So that reduced the time between my connections from 2.25 hours to 1.25 hours!
They did not check in my bag all the way to Portugal. I was told to go thru baggage claim at Casablanca and recheck my bag there.
Since I only had 1 hour between the flights, there was no way I could have made it happen and so I had no time to reclaim my luggage.
I have complained to the airline the same day about my lost luggage when I landed and have yet to hear back from them.
Moreover, the food sucked on the airline, some of the toilets didn’t even have toilet paper, some didn’t even work!

Flight attendants make NO effort to have passengers use headphones so phones, laptops, pads, etc. are all blaring videos, music, prayer music, and other misc. noise. Passengers were yelling to be heard over the noise.  Not a prayer of sleeping on this red-eye flight.  It was cheap, but not worth it.  Flight from Morocco to Madrid was better (smaller plane), but still not up to standard.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541RichardH,Richard H wrote a review Jun 2018,Richard H,"Annapolis, Maryland",39 contributions,46 helpful votes,Washington DC - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r587457399-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Pay a bit more and chose another airline.,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We circled for over an hour and a half on our approach to JFK. Finally the FA (flight attendant) announced there was a lot of incoming traffic and ""please be patient"". After more circling, the FA got on to tell us the weather in NYC was ""very bad"" and we would be landing in Philadelphia. Way passed the time it would have taken to land in Philly I asked the FA where we were going, and he said ""Philadelphia"". It did no good to tell him we were way beyond that destination. Finally someone got on the PA and said we were landing at Washington's Dulles airport. I don't know how old any of the readers of TA are, but this was beginning to sound like the movie ""Airport"" where the gate keeps changing.
We land in DC. The FA announces that we have to stay on the plane because JFK is now open and we'll be taking off in an emphatic ""one hour"". One hour comes and goes. No information. They keep us , like hostages, on the plane in an airless cabin for four hours. Four hours. There is no information despite many of us asking. The FA were brusque and downright rude. It was very uncomfortable on the plane with no air. The woman in back of me threw up. I had to go to first class where the FA was sitting with another FA, just schmoozing, to inform them they had to attend to the sick passenger.
The bathrooms were not usable.
After four hours they told us a bus would come and take us to the terminal (as we were located at a re-fueling station). The bus came and we were let out at the main terminal where Air Maroc disappeared. No staff, nobody. An entire plane was left to their own devices after midnight to figure out how they would get to their destinations. There was a very pregnant woman, women in wheel chairs, children.
Ultimately we made a reservation on Amtrak for 5:30 am, leaving the airport at 3am and taking a cab for $100 to Union Station.
Apparently Air Maroc bears no responsibility for getting folks to their destinations since this flight was diverted due to weather, as opposed to a mechanical problem with the plane.
I get that this airline flies direct to Casablanca from JFK and it's only a 6 hour flight, but if I ever went back to Morocco again, I'd rather fly to Europe and take another carrier. There was no excuse for the surliness of the flight attendants, the complete lack of information, the disinformation, and total lack of concern for the passengers.
The following small detail recedes in light of all this but it is ironic that when we got to the airport in Casablanca in plenty of time for this flight, we were told that the plane was boarding ""now"". Due to Ramadan, which had not even begun yet, the time had changed to an hour earlier. We were aware of this, but our flight was for 3;30. We got no notification from RAM that the flight would be leaving at 2:30 - so that was two hours earlier than expected.It is ironic because we were seated in a row 3 seats across. The third person must not have known about the time change and missed the flight. We would have been better off if we did also.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnl691,lynn l wrote a review Jun 2018,lynn l,"New York City, New York",36 contributions,30 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r587251478-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Royal ?

I just hope our King ( Allah ynser Sidna!!) do something about it because we suffer when we have to come visit our home land and our families. They lost my suitcase with most of all my belongings.

"Good start to flight with ground staff giving  me an exit row seat for a bit of extra comfort for which I was truly grateful until sat next to a 'gentleman' whose aim it seems was to use all the available space not just for his seat but for mine as well. Boarding was efficient and cannot fault the Heathrow based ground staff in any way.  Boarding once on the plane was chaotic and unstructured with flight crew standing round watching and occasionally pointing, to little effect. Seats were generally comfortable for economy and well padded. They do not include any kind of in seat entertainment except for in my case the incessant elbowing of the adjacent passenger. No TV screens, but moreover no USB chargers for individual electronic devices. The seat arm on my particular chair had fallen apart. There were no extendable headrests and the feel of the plane overall was one of a slightly down at heel coach that you might have experienced in the early 80's whilst stuck on a motorway on a bank holiday. So onto Dinner. The main course was bog standard boiled beef and rice, but with the addition of 3 small prunes, to give a vague tagine-ness to the proceedings. The famous chef and writer Robert Carrier once described Moroccan cuisine as one of the world's greats. This meal was not what Mr Carrier could have been opining on. The most interesting part of the meal was a small postage stamp sized piece of Cold Smoked Atlas trout fillet. This had a hint of dill and was as tasty as it was chewy. A vaguely pleasant plain set yogurt served as a dessert along with a plastic encased blob of cream cheese.  Fortunately RAM is not a dry airline so a small 25cl can of Flag Speciale was provided, albeit somewhat grudgingly. Unfortunately the beer was lightweight, Luke warm and with a distinctly unpleasant chemical aftertaste. The coffee when obtained from the steward who walked past without offering any was robust enough to take away any trace of the beer along with the top of my mouth.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimhA5202GY,Jim H wrote a review Jun 2018,Jim H,"Harlow, United Kingdom",45 contributions,14 helpful votes,London - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r585824669-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Coach trip but on a plane,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"To copy from Jane Austen, ""it is a truth, universally acknowledged, that a passenger flying coach will have mostly a ah-so-so flight"" .
Truth be told, in the era of mass transportation and commodity - fication, most passengers are just thankful to get to their destination on time, with their luggage intact, and safely. most of the international carriers fit this bill admirably, thank to rigorous training of crew, high safety expectations and accountability, and infusion of technology at all levels of the airline operations.
In the commercial arena each player wants to sell a ""brand"". My experience with RAM in the air and ground made me think about branding.
RAM delivered my wife and I with no real hiccups from IAD to CMN and then onwards to FCO and then back with a layover in CMN on the return leg as the CMN-IAD flight is only 3x weekly.
Having flown across the globe many times, and recently on one of the ME3 carriers, the flights on RAM were an anomaly. I did not feel the cabin crew connecting with me on a person to person basis, they did not seem to reach out to the individual, unlike the other carriers i am used to. Upon landing at IAD we took the mobile lounge to Immigration and the crew cabin and cockpit were seated/standing just round us. I chatted briefly with the lady flight attendant next to me and also thanked the captain who piloted the Dreamliner across the pond handling the aircraft through several moderate turbulence. All of the staff had a very low key body language, and even today my image of them is that their heads are partly bowed. A dreamliner captain has a very significant responsibility and it comes with authority, however the RAM captain body language and demeanor conveyed very little of it, and if so was very muted. In the end RAM is ROYAL (air maroc) and maybe that explains it all? Living in the western world we are used to a different system that is palbable across many aspects of our lives.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/387adeshs,Adesh S wrote a review Jun 2018,Adesh S,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",79 contributions,24 helpful votes,Washington DC - Rome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r585792319-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Understanding Branding?,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from Marrakech to Barcelona through Casablanca. I had heard horror stories about Royal Air Maroc and that luggage is often lost when you transfer through Casablanca but happily we had no problems. The flights left on time and our luggage arrived with us in Barcelona thankfully.

The airport in Marrakech is beautiful and although there were several lines we had to pass through for security, passports, etc, it all went well. The airport in Casablanca however is terrible - it is not very attractive and the area where we had to wait for the connecting flight to Barcelona was terrible - uncomfortable, small and a blaring overhead announcement every 2 minutes. We had to be taken by bus out to the plane and did have to sit in the hot bus for 10+ minutes which was annoying - some passengers were very upset about this. The Casablance airport really should be upgraded.

The 2 flights were problem free and comfortable.

"This was my very first trip to Morocco.  After a near perfect, wonderful flight from Amsterdam to Casablanca, my return trip would not go as well.

"This was an interesting experience.  For vacation, my wife and I booked round-trip through Expedia for Doha-Madrid with a connection in Casablanca on Royal Air Maroc.  A week after booking, Expedia emailed me that RAM changed the return flight and to contact them.  Unable to sort it out via email or online, a 30 minute international long distance call later - RAM changed their flight schedule to being an hour later (it still showed as being unchanged online for new bookings btw) and wanted to reschedule us later or another day.  Expedia talked to them, booked us the next day same time and a two hour layover for the connecting RAM flight back to Doha.  Then the connecting flight time changed and had a five hour layover.  Well, on checkin in Madrid, the customer service gave us a new way back - Madrid to Casablanca to Marrakech to Doha!  Surprise!  New layover times too.  Changed again, without any warning at all.  Customer service agent only spoke Spanish or Arabic and was completely unable to, or more likely unwilling to get anyone who spoke: English, Turkish, German, Russian, Scots-Gaelic or Japanese for us.  Sorry, but my Spanish es muy malo... tres anos en escuela, pero hace anos trenty quatro..In addition, the -printed Expedia tickets- listing a check bag weight of 25kg was refused by the agent who had ya remove 2kg each for our carryons because he wanted a 23kg limit.Exit rows not available.

"My flight with Royal Air Maroc was a complete terrible experience. The planes were old, worn out and service was almost absent. My flight was Banjul to Stockholm, and included flight exchange in Cassablanca. I was late at gate in Cassablanca, but still within  'gate closing time'. However, I was denied access to my flight to Stockholm. Further handling of air Maroc, bad information to find  necessary further hjelp on the airport, arrogance and incompetence is something that I never have experienced before. As of  May 2018, I have not yet managed to refund my extra expenses from royal air Maroc to get home from Cassablanca. I will for sure never use Air Maroc again, and my best advice to everyone Else is to avoid both royal air Maroc and airports in Morroco",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitabZ4548PA,anitabZ4548PA wrote a review May 2018,anitabZ4548PA,"Telemark, Norway",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Banjul - Stockholm,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r582298045-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Complete  arrogance, total absence of service minded and follow-up",Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The ground transit staff in Morocco are very unfriendly and 80% don't speak English! The lay-over in Morocco is almost a whole day and they are supposed to offer complimentary hotel accommodation; but they abandon you with the excuse that hotel rooms are no more available. Then you end up either roaming the airport or sleeping on one of the uncomfortable airport seats until your flight is ready for boarding. However, I usually fly this airline because it is cost-effective and they are generous with the Frequent Flyer program.. In addition, I am not a lover of direct flights lasting more than 6-7 hours in the air, so I consider this airline as the most appropriate for my travels to the UK and the USA. Casablanca to London is about 3 hours while to New York is about 6 hours 35 mins.

"I bought a JFK-MAD with connection in CMN, booking reference OCSIW2.
The first flight AT 203 was supposed to leave from JFK at 16:50 on April 15. The connecting flight, AT 972 was supposed to land in MAD on April, 16 at 10:50. Flight AT 203 was delayed.

The passengers were not informed and we had to wait for almost 4 hours before boarding, and about an hour inside the plane. We landed in CMN around 8 am. I had my boarding pass for the connecting flight. NO ONE in the plane or in the control informed me about the status of my boarding pass. I arrived at the gate. Boarding was starting and there was a line. I was on the line and on time for the flight and I was denied boarding without any explanation.
That was probably an overbooked flight I was not allowed to get into the plane. I went to the management office and the only solution they could offer was to reschedule my flight. ROYAL AIR MAROC put me in their next flight, leaving from CMN at 15.45, almost 8 hours after my scheduled flight. They gave me a ticket for lunch -only to be redeemed in the unhealthiest restaurant -food stored without lids, and no appropriate health measures- and refused to answer my questions or to give me a justification of the delay. I even ask them to put me in an earlier Iberia flight, leaving at 11 am, but they literally laughed at me.

I put a claim on April 17 and I have called ROYAL AIR MAROC several times and sent about 10 emails but no one has replied. I have contacted the company regarding this claim and regarding a confirmation of the flight delay.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luciagarciavelazquez,luciagarciavelazquez wrote a review May 2018,luciagarciavelazquez,"Madrid, Spain",2 contributions,3 helpful votes,New York City - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r582211061-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Denied boarding, delayed flight",Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Absolutely DIABOLICAL service! I've never met such a rude group of people ever. From the check in staff, to the air staff, to the staff at the boarding gate. There's no relief from the extremely disrespectful, embarrassing and down right cruel treatment you receive from the staff.
The company staff unpacked a box of biscuits I had bought from Morocco. The package had been vert well wrapped to prevent the box spilling out.
I had absolutely no issue with this as I am totally aware of the threat to security we face.
When the package was opened I asked if it was possible to get some tape to re wrap it, the staff refused. I asked if I could ask the manager if it was possible who also refused very abruptly.
At this point I was quite confused as I couldn't understand what the big issue was. I then asked the lady who had unpacked my biscuits and I realised that the man had told all 5 of the staff members to ignore me. They stood up against the window with heir hands behind their back and TOTALLY IGNORED my pleas for tape.
I was soooooooo embarrassed and literally burst into tears! The manager still had no compassion at this point and everyone continued to ignore me.

"Generally, the flights were what you would expect on any national airline.
-- Online check-in has the usual glitches.
-- Aircraft that have sometimes seen better days.
-- Reasonable food.
-- Customer service at Moroccan airports - taken with a pinch of salt.

So, the detail -
Online check-in went smoothly. We were allowed to select our seats, which was a bonus. One less thing to worry about.
Arriving at Manchester airport and dropping off our luggage. This was normal. Luggage tags were placed on our bags to collect at Agadir.
Plane change at Casablanca - The chaos now begins. No real direction as to where to go. Hint look up at the ceiling. The signs are small but marked -- local transfers. Unfortunately no real queuing system. Everyone seems to be in a rush and tries to fit through a very small narrow corridor. Passports and tickets checked. Any hand luggage goes through a scanner. Transfer is via a bus to the plane. Good news a small but newish plane.

Arrival at Agadir. We were the only flight at approx. 10:00pm so the airport was have asleep. Reminder -- Collect a landing card and complete per person before proceeding to the immigration. Only 3 desks were open, then 4, then 5 and about 10 mins later up to 14 desks had opened. A slow process but the good news we had arrived in Agadir.

NIGHTMARE TIME!!!!!!!
Our luggage had not arrived and no one spoke enough good English to assist. Eventually we were told that it had not been transferred to our plane in Casablanca. All the missing luggage approx. 80 people had been located and would be on the next flight into Agadir. Thankfully, this was in about 50 mins time. We asked if the luggage could be transferred to our hotel. Unfortunately, the airport did not have any such facility so this was not possible. The only option was to wait. Not long to go, but a 50 min wait felt like years with tired children. Eventually the luggage arrived. Now we just had to face the flight back in a few weeks.

The return flight thankfully all went well.

Service and food on all four flights was ok. Kids enjoyed that fact that the drinks were the standard 330ml size and not the tiny cans that they serve on some flights.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hussainr,Hussainr wrote a review May 2018,Hussainr,"West Midlands, United Kingdom",160 contributions,36 helpful votes,Manchester - Agadir,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r579091491-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,outbound - luggage did not arrive.

"Do not fly with Royal Air Maroc. Arrived at Marrakech airport for a 10am flight arriving the recommended 3 hours prior to flight to Malaga, Spain, allowing over 3 hours at Casablanca before connecting flight to Malaga, Spain. Told at 10 o'clock that there was a technical problem that would be 10 minutes, over 3 hours later flight departed. No other information was given. Missed connecting flight, very difficult to obtain any information/help at Casablanca, put up in a sub standard hotel for the night with no luggage, promised shuttle to airport at 11am for 2pm flight. Shuttle finally arrived and got to airport half hour before departure. Flight finally departed 2.5 hours late, absolutely no information as to why or when flight was to go, so another day lost. Two days of my life totally lost plus cost of shuttle and accommodation in Malaga, Spain.
Apparently this is a very common occurrence. Also information at the airports is totally non existent.

"I flew with Emirates from Melbourne Australia and had a connecting flight from Casablanca to Marrakech with “Royal Air Maroc”.  What a disgrace to Marocco’s Royal Family, to use the word Royal.    I had 6 hours to wait for my flight , I was ok about that. I went immediately to the departure area for my connecting flight. I noticed my flight number was not on the board. I spoke to a security person as there was no Royal Air Maroc staff. He said , go back and wait , it will come up. After another hour and a half , nothing, so I walked the long distance back to the security explained situation,again he says, go back and wait. Another hour and half some staff came for the boarding of another flight. I asked about my flight and was told it was cancelled. They said you are not flying.  After some discussion it was suggested to get a different boarding pass. Back to the security, and I said , I have to go back to the office for a boarding pass, eventually they agreed to let me go through. Well this also was a disaster, I can’t even begin to tell the story.   I did eventually get a bus to Marrakech, I was told I wouldn’t have to pay anything, but when I got there , the driver wanted money.     I would certainly never recommend this company to anyone. No one knows anything of any other department within the company. It is nothing more than a CIRCUS with CLOWNS attempting to run it.    All the different areas allocated to Royal Air Maroc, that I had to go back and forth ,trying to get some assistance ,are filthy and in need of cleaning and painting.

"I was flying back to Sao Paulo from Casablanca airport and initially the flight was delayed a couple of hours for no apparent reason. Then people from Royal Air Moroc said that the flight was cancelled and we would be flying the next day. Updates came completely unorganized and spread like gossips. Staff could barely speak English, or pretended so.
While a crowd was being guided to leave the airport, someone else started to shout stating that the flight would not be cancelled anymore, and would leave in some more hours.
And we were back to the gate. For some extra hours of waiting. At least it departed.

The plane was a brand new 787, but R.A.M. opted for a cheap entertainment package, which offered limited options of movies, series, etc.

Service was not very good either.

"I have to admit, I gulped when I saw that the plane was a vintage 747, but needs must.  Air France in its strike action had cancelled our flight and a marvelous ticket agent in New York had re-booked us onto Royal Air Maroc, which was not on strike.  But a 747?  The plane showed its age inside too--no usb ports, no entertainment system.  None of that mattered.  The skill of the pilot mattered, and he took his old bird over the Pyrenees and landed it safely in a wicked crosswind at Mohammed V Airport.

"By far the worst Airline I have ever had the unfortunate pleasure to travel on! Royal air maroc did not show any social or what I would consider minimal ethical standards. The stewards were rude, very disrespectful people it was like you were bothering them if you ask for a cup of water.

"I flew Royal Air Maroc from Lagos , Nigeria to Casablanca. It was very below par and I was really surprised . First of all, we weren’t able to check in online from lagos , there was no inflight entertainment all through a 4hr 35mins flight , there was no meal, just a box that was practically thrown at us by the very hostile cabin crew which contained bread and yoghurt. I had never experienced that on an international flight .
Coming back was better , I was able to check in from Morocco, and there was a meal but I couldn’t even eat it. The fish was underdone . The plane that took us from lagos was old but the one from Casablanca was better.
Overall, it was an okay experience but I am not sure I will fly them again. Maybe if I have absolutely no choice, because I didn’t think they treated their customers well on the Los - Cmn leg of the journey .

I have flown on over 15 different airlines and flown at least 50 flights but words cannot describe how poor RAM’s service is - each and every member of staff was rude and blunt (if you can get one to answer your questions - they had the habit of just walking away if you asked a question) especially when travelling to a country where Arabic nor French are your first language; they show zero empathy and have a couldn’t-care-less attitude. I flew from London-Gatwick to Casablanca and that flight was delayed with no reason given then from Casablanca to Marrakesh and that was also delayed with no reason given. The in-flight entertainment was one tiny screen per 6 passengers and was a black and white silent Charlie Chaplin movie. The seats were old and no where to charge your phone - the plane was in a delapidated state. My bag had cuts and marks all over it from poor handling. If I could give a 0 likeliness to recommend I would.

"After reading many reviews on Trip Advisor I was a little uneasy flying with this airline.  Original flight was to leave on Saturday night the 14th of April at 9:30ish received an email around 2:00 that afternoon the flight was delayed until 2:00 a.m. Sunday morning.  Oh well, finally took off around 3:30 a.m. and I must stay that the plane was newer, in very good shape, and the flight attendants were very helpful.  The trip was very comfortable.  Felt safe flying on the airline that was provided.  This is the most important thing in my book!!A little mix up on the return flight with our tickets.  Only 1 person in our party of 3 was able to board without going to the Royal Air Morac ticket office in the Casablanca airport.  A little unnerving, but the gentleman was very helpful and we boarded on time.  Again a very good flight home.

"Royal Air Maroc is a stunning example of how not to run an airline.

Buckle up—you're not going to believe the experience my husband and I had using this airline. Now we know why all the locals in Morocco never fly with Royal air Marco. As the owner of our riad said, you only have to fly with them once to know why you will never fly with them again.

My husband and I traveled from JFK in New York to Casablanca with a connection to Marrakech in Morocco. Royal Air Maroc is the only airline that goes directly from JFK to Casablanca. We thought this would be best to avoid a layover in Europe. Wanting a morning flight, we originally booked for Friday, April 13 at 7:30 am from JFK to Casablanca. About a month before the trip, we get an email saying that flight was cancelled and we had been rebooked for a flight that same night. They neglected to also reschedule our connection to Marrakech. Okay, no big deal at this point. I called to get a Sunday morning 7:30 am flight instead with a connection.

Less than 24 hours before we were set to fly out, I get another email stating that our flight to Casablanca had been delayed. Take off was now at 4:50 pm. Great, there goes our morning flights.

We get to JFK at noon that Sunday, and check in is not open yet. Royal Air Maroc must rent out space from Korean Air for check in as they do not have their own counters. The Royal Air Marco staff took their time to slowly set up their borrowed counters, while chit-chatting, talking on their cell phones, etc. Meanwhile, the line to checkin gets longer and longer as they go 45 minutes past the scheduled time checkin was supposed to open before they actually start seeing people.

We get our tickets, go through security, and head to the gate. Long story short, we do not end up taking off until 8:30 pm. The whole time people were wondering what was causing the delay and the Royal Air Maroc staff were not forthcoming with any information whatsoever. Getting frustrated at this point but at least we were on our way to the destination. And luckily we would still make our 10 am connection to Marrakech.

Wait a minute—not so fast. That connection flight to Marrakech? Royal Air Maroc is again late with scanning boarding passes and getting everyone onto the bus on the tarmac that takes passengers to the plane. We wait on the bus 10 minutes when all of the sudden one of the staff comes out and tells everyone to come back inside the airport. The plane was not even there yet. Getting really frustrated at this point because we are tired and just want to get to Marrakech. My husband checked his phone for the flight status and saw that the connection had been cancelled. He showed this to the staff, who had absolutely no idea this was the case. Yes, the Royal Air Maroc staff learned their own flight was cancelled from the flight status on the phone of a would-be passenger.

Panic among the staff and passengers ensues as everyone tries to figure out a solution other than waiting for the next flight to Marrakech 12 hours later. Passengers start yelling and venting their frustration. The staff says they will put everyone on a bus and that one is waiting outside the airport. Guess what? No bus. After three hours of waiting and trying to pry information about what is going on and no bus anywhere in sight, my husband and I decide to split a taxi ride to Marrakech with two other people who were also going there. 150 Euros total for the ride. Good thing we thought to bring lots of Euros with us as well. At this point I would have been quite angry were I not slightly delirious with sleep deprivation.

On the way back home we decided to hire a cab to drive us back to Casablanca as we do not trust Royal Air Maroc to actually get us there on time to catch the transatlantic flight. We go to check in only to find we had been completely bumped from our flight to JFK because we did not show up at the airport in Marrakech for the first flight. They had given our seats away now we had no place on the plane. Okay, so we should have called in advance to explain that we were not taking that flight.

However, the way the staff handled the situation was not exactly professional. We were bounced back and forth between the ticketing office and the checkin counters several times. The woman in the ticketing office actually said to us in a nasty tone, ""I don't understand how this is my problem,"" before saying that if they could not get us on this flight it would not be until Tuesday before they could get us back out. We asked if they would pay for a hotel if this would be the case—nope.

After an hour of this we finally found a kind and helpful (by Royal Air Maroc standards...) staff member who went back to speak with the woman at the ticketing office to get us on the waitlist. Thanks to her efforts and my husband's persistence, we made it on the flight after all. By the grace of God we took off on time, too.

The only thing that impressed me about this airline was that the planes were brand new, and the pilots were extremely competent. I guess if I want anyone to be competent, it's the pilot. They were all clean-cut guys who looked like they knew what they were doing. Landings were flawless and you could barely tell when the wheels of the plane actually hit the ground.

Customer service, timeliness, accuracy, and reputation mean nothing to this airline. I have no idea how they have survived and stayed in business since 1957. Next time we fly to Morocco, we'll take a layover in Europe with a different airline to avoid the headache that is Royal Air Maroc.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/8b/6f/95/elyse-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esadtler,Elyse S wrote a review Apr 2018,Elyse S,USA,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,New York City - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r575291089-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,AVOID,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This has to be one of the worst airline experiences of my life. We were suppose to fly out of Rio on Friday 20th 2018. Once we were all checked in we went to the gate only to be told that there would be a 30 minute delay. This 30 minute delay turned into 90 minutes, with the airline finally cancelling the flight. The transportation from the airport to the hotel was a shamble. No coordination what so ever. So people like us opted just to take a cab to the suggested hotel. Once there we discover after waiting for an hour that they did not have enough rooms for everyone. So we took a second cab to the next suggested hotel. We got a room there. The following day evening was picked up by coach and we were told that our flight would be at 6pm. Again, all checked in, went to the gate and they repeated the same rubbish as the night before, cancelled our flight. Why bring everyone to the airport only to cancel their flight again. Everyone was clearly and justifiably annoyed. They had hardly any staff and no sense of direction. When asked if we would be refunded our money if we book with another airline we could not get a clear answer from them.
The second nights hotel was aweful, some nasty place in town. We still have no idea if we will be flying today or not.
This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown with, and I fly a lot. Please pay extra and get a more reputable airline and avoid this nightmare that all of us have had to endure.
Also, RAM does not have a office, a desk or even any representatives in Rio. So if you get stuck then you are pretty much on your own. Also, there website for handling claims is an absolute joke. If we pay for our own tickets back to London it will cost £1200 each with no guarantee of us ever seeing a penny of that again.

"We've travelled in Morocco for 9 days in late Dec 2017 and had booked a flight with Royal Air Moroc (""RAM"") on 31st Dec to Casablanca, and then fly back to Hong Kong via another airline.  We had a tremendous disappointing experience with RAM!!!  First of all, we were only informed of the flight cancellation when we got to the airport at around 9:45am on 31st Dec.  (we had done online checkin within 48 hours of the flight's departure, and the flight was supposed to take off at 11:55am and arrive at Casablanca at 12:45pm)!  There were passengers arguing and complaining against the RAM staff as they didn't give prior notification to us, and most of them needed to take a connecting flight back to their respective home countries.  However, the RAM staff was rude and unfriendly.  They even asked us to call the police!After much hassle, the RAM staff managed to arrange coaches for the passengers to get to the Casablanca Airport.  They also assured us that we could definitely catch our connecting flight which departed at 2:00 pm at Casablanca (as this was not their first time to have flight cancellation, and passengers needed to take connecting flights).  Even so, we needed to spend a lot of waiting time at the coach for other passengers to come on board, and the RAM staff just put on a ""couldn't care less"" attitude!When we reached the Casablanca Airport, it's already passed 1:30 pm, the check-in counter for our connecting flight had already closed!

"After being rerouted from Air Canada we were put on Royal Air Maroc. Our luggage never arrived at our destination and was lost for 8 days. When we did receive our luggage the contents were wet, my camera was stole, and contents in disarray. The brand new bag I purchased was ruined.
Air Maroc customer service representatives are very rude. When submitting a claim they offered one hundred dollars, but I would have to provide my bank account information to receive the money. Why would I give the company who stole from me my account information.
Many of our fellow travelers experienced luggage delays also.
Don't fly this airline if you check a bag as you may never see it, and if you do plan to be violated as there's a good chance your items will be missing.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994maryv,Mary V wrote a review Apr 2018,Mary V,"Holly, Michigan",35 contributions,46 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r574051660-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Horrible airline,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was trying to think of what the equivalent of our experience would be in the US. Say you booked a flight to Chicago from Houston which had a layover in Dallas. Royal Air Maroc cancels your flight to Dallas and instead of booking you on a different flight they try to get you on a bus to Dallas.  You say no I don't want to go to Dallas I'm trying to get to Chicago. There are direct flights from this airport to your destination.  They also have the same flight tomorrow So they yes we are taking you to a flight to Chicago. You go through security and before you exit the airport the group as a whole refuses to leave because we do not want to be on a bus. The guy at the door says yes you are going to a flight. Once you are out they say yep it really is a bus ride we're putting you on but it's only an hour and a half ride.  The next person says it's 2-3 hours.  You know from Google maps that it is actually a 4-5   hour ride.   Unhappy you say again I do not want to go on this bus ride.  Why can't we book a flight from this airport.  Earlier on we tried to go to the ticket counter and they pulled us away. Back to the buses. I speak to one guy who says he is not responsible and runs away.  I speak to a second guy who points to the guy walking away and says he is responsible. I say I just talked to that guy and he said he is not. Second guy assures me he is.  I tell second guy I don't need to go to Casablanca and want to go to Lisbon.  He says don't worry there are 2 flights to Lisbon one in the morning and one in the afternoon and we will get there today.  I show him my ticket and say I was booked on the afternoon flight at 2:50 and since it is 1:30 We will not make it in time.  He says oh there are actually 3 flights and I will make it in time.  He even tells me that someone from the airport will be traveling with us to make sure things go smoothly and points to the person he says will be traveling with us. Satisfied I get on the bus. Once we are all settled in on the bus another person from airport gets on and says people going to France will have a flight today and everyone else will fly tomorrow.  Grrr we leave for Casablanca.  No one has been given an opportunity to use the bathroom, there is no bathroom or A.C. on the bus. We stop for water and a bathroom break after 20 min.  After an hour the bus breaks down and we sit on the side of the road for an hour and a half.  Some passengers choose to hitch hike.   Another bus picks us up and after 20 min we stop because the bus driver is worries about the same problem we had with the first bus.  It turns out it's okay and we reach Casablanca finally after 6 1/2 hours of travel.  No one traveled with us, there is no one to greet us. Confused we go  to the terminal we are dropped at. It's not the correct terminal.  I ask Air Maroc to please take us to the correct place. They ask us to leave and say it's not their problem we should go to the  international terminal. They refuse to walk us to the correct place.  We ask for a manager so we can see about a refund for the flight we didn't get and are told there isn't one.   We go to the  office we are told to go to.  The office says we need to go to the ticket booth. We got to the ticket booth and are told there is only one flight and it is in the afternoon the next day. We go back and forth, at this point I don't  believe anything I'm told and they show me on their screen that there is only one flight. We take the flight. I ask about a refund for the Marrakech to Casablanca flight.  I am told that the problem with our flight was solved, they got us a solution and there is no problem.  I ask to speak to a manager. He points to another guy. I speak to that guy and he says he is not responsible he just does our accommodations.  He points me back to the first guy and says he can call a manager.  I go back to the first guy and he says he refuses to call a manager, not his responsibility he just books flights,  and I should talk to the office.  I find out he has told someone that he will give them a refund form.  I ask for the same form.  He says he will get it for me and several other passengers.  Time passes he tells us we need to go to the office to get the form.  We mention how we have been lied to and do not believe him.  He is offended when I tell him I think he is lying to me.   We go to the office.  There is no form, he was lying. We are told we must go online to fill out a form to complain. We say we do not want to complain we want our money back.  He tells us to do the form online.  I tell him his colleague said there was a paper form and ask if if his colleague lied.  He says yes he lied. They put us up in a hotel. ask for 2 rooms since we had 2 tickets. He changes it to 2 rooms.  He misspelled one of our names.  I ask him to reprint it with the correct name in case this causes problems.  He refuses. Much arguing happens and after Andrew asks more nicely he finally prints it. I feel like this is subpar service.  Though we were assured everything was great and we were taken care of. :(",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanE1800,Susan E wrote a review Apr 2018,Susan E,,9 contributions,4 helpful votes,Marrakech - Casablanca,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r573946991-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Horrible experience ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If you’re like me - you take online reviews with a grain of salt. Also, air travel is often unpleasant, so how bad can one airline be? Well the answer is bad, extremely bad. So TERRIBLY bad that it makes you write your first online review. If you enjoy multiple cancellations, no information, refusal to assist and ticket agents purposefully providing incorrect information - then this airline is for you! And for a fun bonus, if you ask enough questions about ridiculous things such as “flight information” and “boarding times” etc, the check-in agent will tell you your first flight leg is cancelled - when in fact - you’ve been on the flight all along and there’s no cancellation. This airline also provides the opportunity to wait on a bus for an indefinite amount of time to travel to a local airport hotel, thus forcing you to seek your own accommodations. I would pay good money to avoid this airline and never have to utter its name again. Stay tuned to see if we ever leave - entering hour 20.

"The outbound trip was almost text book except for a delay, in Manchester, due to French Air Traffic Control but luckily we were able to connect with our ongoing flight to Casablanca. The return was a different story. We were informed that we could collect our bags for the 14 hour layover in Casablanca. We were refused access to iur bags as they had been deemed 'in transit' and we would have to wait until Manchester. We then decided to go to the Private Lounge but when we spoke to the P.R.office we were informed that without boarding passes we were not allowed to the 'airside' and as were classed as 'domestic' passengers that would not be possible until 9 am the following morning. This airline is being badly let down by its ground staff. When I returned home I found my bag completely covered in 'clingfilm'. I now understand why I was not allowed access to my case. The bottom of my case had been dropped on the floor creating a hole I could get my fist in resulting in having only 1 usable wheel.

"We were skeptical about taking RAM based on so many negative reviews, but the opportunity to fly directly from Washington to Casablanca made us take the risk.  Overall, we were quite impressed.The plane was relatively new and comfortable.  The entertainment system was adequate - nothing special, but enough to keep us occupied.  The food was plentiful and quite good.  The staff wasn't terribly attentive, and we had to often hunt them down for water, but they didn't have any issue with us serving ourselves in the galley.  This is probably my biggest complaint because per Moroccan law, no liquids of any sort (even sealed bottles of water) are allowed on the plane besides what fit in a quart sized bag.  We were quite thirsty and it took a long time for the staff to bring drinks.We'd definitely fly RAM again.  I've experienced worse on domestic carriers.

"My husband and I just returned from two weeks in Morocco. Flying from Los Angeles we wanted as few plane changes as possible.  Every other route we looked at required us to stop in Europe and most required stops in New York and in Europe. Royal Air Moroc flies directly to Casa Blanca from JFK.  The flights were on time and the food was better than most airplane food.  The movie choices were fine. The Business Class is small and we flew economy which was slightly better than some American economy seats.  The flight attendants were helpful and friendly. There was a problem on the outgoing flight where the back exit door was not working and there fore, people sitting in the last rows had to be booked on other flights. However, we traveled with a group in Morocco and on the return, several of our fellow travelers had to switch to Royal Air Moroc when Air France went on strike.

"Royal Air Maroc nearly ruined my entire vacation. I have never experienced such a poorly run and staffed airline in my entire life. We booked a round-trip fight from NYC to Lisbon, with a 1.5 hour layover in Casablanca on the way there. Two days before my flight, I received an email from Royal Air Maroc stating that my second flight (Casablanca - Lisbon) had been moved UP an hour, and our layover would only be 30 minutes. I thought it would be ok as they did not advise anything about the connection and made no other contact. Then, the morning of my flight (around 8am) they called and told us that we would not be able to make our connection and they would therefore be bumping us from our second flight. They said they would not be able to get us on another flight from Casablanca to Lisbon for THREE DAYS - effectively leaving us stranded in Casablanca for three days of our planned week-long vacation. We said this was not acceptable, and they must get us to Lisbon on the same day we had planned. The customer service agent said he would need to speak with his manager and asked us to call back later. This was the beginning of an HOURS long fight with their customer service agents. We called back 20 minutes later, had to re-explain the entire situation to a new agent across language barriers, and again were told we would need to call back in ""a few minutes"". 20 minutes later we called back and were again offered the three day wait in Casablanca. We explained the situation and again were told to call back in a few minutes. (This calling and waiting 20 minutes happened several times I don't even know how many times we ended up calling them. Another 20 minutes later we called back again and this time the agent told us that they would reach out to TAP Portugal and try to get us on their non-stop to Lisbon also leaving that night. She said she would need to call back in a few minutes to see if that would work. I asked how long a few minutes would be, and got the answer ""I don't know - a few minutes"".

Several rounds of waiting 20 minutes and calling back later, we decided that we had had it. The agents were all rude, unhelpful, not-understanding of why we were upset, and one actually laughed on the phone at us when we tried to explain why we were not happy. We decided that we could not play phone tag any longer and decided to head to the airport several hours early to deal with Royal Air Maroc in person. During the 40-minute ride, we called a couple times and were told both times they were still waiting to hear from TAP Portugal and they did not yet know if they could get us on their flight. When we finally arrived at JFK, we found the 10-person Royal Air Maroc counter to be COMPLETELY EMPTY. Not one Royal Air Maroc employee was present. We panicked and asked a nearby JFK employee who advised us that they would be back in around an hour to two hours. In the meantime, we kept calling customer service. Finally, they said that they would be unable to get us on the TAP Portugal flight. Two hours later, when the airline employees finally arrived we asked to speak to a supervisor right away. We explained the whole situation. He took us to the ticketing counter and tried to help us figure out a solution. It was there that we were told that we actually WERE able to get ticketed for the TAP Portugal flight, and that customer service had just either completely lied or had the wrong information. The supervisor tried to get in touch with TAP Portugal, and finally found out that that flight was 22 people overbooked and would be hopeless.

We asked if we could simply be refunded for our flight and figured we could book our own flight for that day or the next on a different airline. They said our flights were non-refundable. We asked if we could be ticketed via their airline for any other flight leaving Casablanca that day for anywhere in Portugal or Spain. They told us that our flights were also non-exchangable and they could not change our second flight. We are two young women, who invested our savings in this trip, and would be totally unsafe being stranded in Morocco for three days!!!!!!! After a lot of back and forth we were basically told that our only option was to try our luck for making the 30 minute connection (really only 10 minutes because they close the gate 20 minutes early). Then if we missed that flight they would try to get us on another flight, but they could not do anything until we missed the flight. We decided we had no other option and decided to go for it. We begged for a seat as close to the front as possible so we could get off the plane ASAP. Thankfully the supervisor gave us at least that. The check-in agent was then completely rude after everything we had been through, and refused to print our second boarding pass - making us lose valuable time on the other side.

When we finally got on the plane, I found my seat to be COVERED IN BLOOD! As if everything else wasn't bad enough. They also had no working USB outlets on a 7 hour international flight, and the in-flight service was minimal and dissapointing at best. When we finally got to Morocco (thankfully we landed about 10 minutes early) we sprinted off the plane and had to go to the check in counter since our second boarding passes were not printed. The woman at the check in counter told us our flight had been closed. We showed her the time and knew we had about 10 minutes. She refused. She got a manager and they spent 5 minutes fiddling with the computer and basically were like oh its not closed but you'll have to hurry. WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULDNT HAVE SPENT THE LAST 10 MINUTES WASTING OUR TIME. We ran straight through to security, and across the airport. We made it just in time and were the last ones to board. We still couldnt believe we made it. The only thanks going to the Supervisor in NYC who gave us seats at the front - the only reason we made it.

In total, all 4 Royal Air Maroc flights we took were dirty, uncomfortable, and poorly serviced. I will never use this joke airline again.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicysnoop,spicysnoop wrote a review Apr 2018,spicysnoop,"New York City, New York",1 contribution,2 helpful votes,New York City - Lisbon,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r572220503-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst flying experience of my life.

"I took this horrible company from Rome to Rio De Janeiro with a stop over in Casablanca. We arrived in Casablanca on-time, however the plane kept on flying in the sky for unknown reasons. We landed 30 minutes late and once at the gate, although the plane was still on the ground, they told us that our tickets to Rio were CANCELLED!!! I asked to the staff on-board several times and they reassured us that the company would wait for us, but, obviously, they didn't! Fortunately, they put me on another plane the same evening and I arrived in Rio with ONLY 8 hours delay!!!! Other people had to wait in Casablanca for 2 days or fly to Sao Paolo the day after, arriving to Rio with 2 days delay! The staff on-board and on-ground was very unpleasant and unprofessional during the whole time.

"Flying out to Washington was fine with the annoying exception that if you purchase RAM tickets in the US, you can't select seats online. We were told to go as early as possible to the airport. We did. Four hours before the flight was to depart we were told to go back to the counter at 5:00. At 4:45 we looked up to see swarms of people there getting served! We jumped in line and were told there were no seats left except for the horrific center aisle. The seats have zero legroom. Flight left on time and it was an uneventful flight.

HOWEVER. The return was another story. Flight scheduled to leave Casa. at 5:30 am. We arrived at airport 3:00 am. Went through three separate security stops which were fine. Then we sat in the restaurant area and waited and waited and waited. There were NO ANNOUNCEMENTS so we went to the gate. Here they SEPARATED our child to one line for more security and my husband and I into another line. When we expressed dismay, suddenly no one spoke English and they insisted we go to the line they indicated where they frisked us, went through EVERY ITEM in our bags before and made us throw away the drinks we had purchased after our first round of security. We then had to look for our daughter. Thankfully she had been able to see us the entire time. Once we found her, we found a seat on the floor (not room for half the passengers in seats) and waited and waited and waited. Not one announcement. Not sure that airport even has an intercom system. Suddenly at 6:15 a wave of people jumped up and ran for the line to board a bus for the tarmac. Apparently they made a verbal announcement just to those within hearing distance of the counter. We followed suit. Stood 15-20 minutes in disorganized lines, made it to the bus for a short ride, they then told us to get off the bus and line up outside the airplane. Only it was RAINING!! stood 5-10 minutes in pouring rain, shivered and was cold across the Atlantic. To top it off, they had only two meat dishes to eat. As vegetarians, we were starving upon landing.

Never again would I fly Royal Air Maroc. I would rather go thru a European stop on a legitimate airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/2e/cf/bc/codeedo.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennesseeGypsee,TennesseeGypsee wrote a review Apr 2018,TennesseeGypsee,Tennessee,363 contributions,311 helpful votes,Washington DC - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r572037726-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,The worst,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After reading all the reviews I was very concerned about our flight. The service and food were good, seats are comfortable. In Casablanca you have to take a bus ride from airplane to the airport. Not very convenient since we had our carry on baggage with us and you have to climb up stairs. Based on the reviews i didn’t want to take chances to check in baggage.
On the way back to New York we were given seats in raw 10, 14, and 23. We managed to switch 2 seats together and I was seating by myself. There is no option to choose your seats for our tickets.
That was very inconvenient. So, I would rather pay more next time with different airline(very concern with all lost luggage complaints) to be able to seat all together.

Booking was simple and I was able to get really economically priced tickets. No selected seating but that was ok. No charge for one checked bag and a small carry on. At the airport, ticket counter agent was courteous. Flight crew worked hard to get a small meal and serve drinks on a short flight (90 minutes). Return flight was from Casablanca.

At least in Business class they provide you with a small amenity kit and some slippers. I am an average man but I could not wear the slippers as they were far too small.

"It's fair to say that customer service does not exist within the Royal Air Maroc. I recently took a round trip to Brazil with RAM with 2 other friends and on our way back I was denied boarding on my connecting flight from Casablanca to London. Three of us had the same tickets but my friends had to fly without me and I stayed additional day at one of the airport hotels because RAM overbooked the flight and sneakily changed my ticket without any information whatsoever and denied me boarding.
The ground crew at Casablanca Airport were not at all helpful, they quickly ignored me and did not provide any information and left me to my own devices. They put me in a poor hotel, where there was hardly anything to eat (yup no joke that unfortunately) and I had to take the flight following day.
If you can, just avoid them because if you have any problem, i.e. denied boarding, grounded, whatever, the staff are very unhelpful and literally treat you like air...
I am actually still battling RAM at the moment for compensation due to the costs I incurred because of their conduct and i am not giving up!

From the below standard lounges to average customer service you are kind of relieved when you get in the aeroplane to note that things start getting marginally better. Seats comfortable but not clean. Emergency exit looked like the handle cover had been used before which is not comforting to note. The food was the one thing worth writing about in terms of taste and choice. For the rest of it really average. Loyalty reward is not linked to any of the mainstream global alliances.

"I booked a return flight from Montreal to Marrakech with long stopovers in Casablanca. As part of our tour of Morocco, we found ourselves close to Casablanca towards the end of the trip. Perfect, we'll just cancel our flight from Marrakesh and hop on our flight from Casablanca to Montreal, right? WRONG.

I get connected with a very rude customer support representative who struggles to understand what I want to do. She constantly interrupts me when I'm explaining, and even puts me on hold while I'm talking at one point. Finally, she tells me that it cannot be done. If I don't show up for my flight from Marrakech to Casablanca, they will cancel my flight from Casablanca to Montreal!

I tell them that I don't want a refund. They can even go ahead and re-sell my ticket to someone else if they want. Nope. they won't do that. I need to be present in Marrakach for my first leg or they will cancel my entire route.

So in the end we needed to take a train from Casablanca to Marrakech, book a hotel in Marrakach, fly back to Casablanca from Marrakech the next morning, and then wait a long 7-hour stopover in the Casablanca airport. All of this was avoidable.

Besides that, even the new 787 deamliner that we took was below average. Dirty, poor service, and loud. During our overnight flight, when people were trying to sleep, the staff wouldn't stop yelling at each other. Very unprofessional.

On the way back, a fellow passenger shows me a video where the Royal Air Maroc pilot apparently forgets to check his flaps, and almost fails a takeoff of a 737.

"The way this airline treats its customers is inhumane. They do not care about your experience, they relish any issues you may encounter, and they will absolutely find ways to strip you of the money you may believe you are saving by booking with them.

PLEASE, for the love of all that is right and good in this world, DO NOT subject yourself to this company’s pathetic excuse for service.

If I could block all experiences with them from memory permanently, I would. The only reason I am leaving this review is the lingering outrage they have left us with. No one should ever be treated the way that they treated us.

Do go to Morocco. The country is beautiful, rich with culture, and has left us with unforgettable memories. Climb the Saharan dunes. Eat dates on your riad’s rooftop.

"If you have not yet booked your flight I would seriously look for alternative carriers. If you have already booked your flights you have my sincere condolences and a suggestion that you only take cabin baggage and do not check any baggage into the hold. The probability is the airline will mislay it and cause you immense problems if you have a connecting flight.

We were booked on a connecting flight to Fez with three hours connection time. 10 minutes before the scheduled departure time the flight was cancelled! With no explanation from any staff we had to make our way back through the airport against all 'do not enter' signs to a desk where a woman told us we would be sent to a hotel in Casablanca and would be put on the next flight which was tomorrow. Our bags would follow so we would have to do without them for 24 hours.

Asking at the baggage desk brought the same response - thy directed us through customs to the accommodation office'

We were put on a minibus which did not go to a Casablanca Hotel, instead taking us all the way to Fes dropping us at 3:30 in the morning at the Fes Marriot Hotel with no bags or explanation. It would seem the airline - instead of putting passengers up in a hotel, saved a load of money by bussing us to the destination without baggage and with no system or information in place for us to get our checked-in bags.

To cut a very long story (of many attempts to resolve this by phone, and a journey to Fes Airport to get it sorted face to face) short we finally saw our bags on the third day after travelling all the way back to Casablanca airport to recover them - despite the baggage office at first denying all knowledge of them!

Having spent €150 on transport and a few essential items like toiletries and underwear, I am going to try to get some money back via the London office as the airline has responsibilities under the Montreal Convention, but don't hold your breath.

The airline is completely useless as you cannot communicate with them if you have a problem. Some phone numbers we were given were not in service, others were unanswered and we wasted two days of our trip and a substantial amount of money I would avoid them if you can.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelib,travelib wrote a review Mar 2018,travelib,Manchester,121 contributions,104 helpful votes,Manchester - Fes,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r566788119-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,appalling customer service,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If I could give zero stars to this airline, I wouldn't hesitate.  I downloaded this app specifically to write this review, my very first.  Do not fly Royal Air Maroc.  I will admit that if your travel plans go smoothly you may have a passable experience.  However, pray that you will not need their laughable ""customer service"", where representatives seem intentionally unhelpful and speak with the thinnest of facades over roiling contempt.  We had an amazing trip to Morocco but this airline did their best to ruin it.  The inexplicable fees were infuriating, but dealing with their customer service both on the phone and at the airport was demoralizing.  Trust me, any money you may save by choosing this airline will eventually be bled from you.  Purchasing their ""serenity fare"" or other refundable tickets will just add to your costs; they will not honor these fare conditions.Years from now, I pray that the memory of seeing the milky way stretch across the Saharan night sky will blot out any memory of the RAM employee who refused to refund our ""refundable tickets"".  I hope that the back-and-forth of haggling for carpets in the Marrakech souks will erase the absolute helplessness of being told we no longer had a flight home and that, no, we couldn't use the desk phone.  The hospitality shown to us in the beautiful medina riads will, hopefully, shoulder out every interaction with RAM customer service.In short, do not fly Royal Air Maroc, but if you do, pray nothing goes wrong...",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomsB4936HK,Tom S wrote a review Mar 2018,Tom S,,1 contribution,4 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r566764875-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Truly Miserable,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Missed the connection in Casablanca. Huge line at the customer service to get hotel voucher. The agent told me that there will be only 2 of us on business class to go to the hotel.

The flight departed a few minutes late due to a late arrival of the aircraft.  No problem.  The plane was new and a B-787.  The crew was professional and friendly.   The entertainment system worked well and had a good selection of new releases including foreign films.   The flight back was wonderful too.  Left almost exactly on time even with a tight connection on a flight to Casablanca from Milano.

"We booked a holiday with flights through Royal Air Maroc. BIGGEST MISTAKE

Long story short, 2 weeks before departure they ended up cancelling our flight to portugal and booking us on a flight that had an 18 hour (from an initial 4 hours) without consulting us. When I called to get answers they pretty much had a “not our problem attitude” with not apology. After a huge fight calling numerous different numbers we were refunded 4 weeks later!

"A booked flight on XL airlines had been canceled and I rebooked a business class flight on Royal Air Maroc for my Grandson who was scheduled for a study abroad program in Paris. While I do not blame Royal Air Maroc for the cancellation of the flight because that was the fault of JFK that had only cleared one runway for international flights. But Royal Air Moroc’s communication was non- exisistent. My grandson checked in one bag and proceeded to wait in the lounge (which was terrific since it was Air France’s lounge). His flight was for 8 pm and all boards said on time. Then it said delayed until after 9pm. At 9pm the terminal closed down for the night. When my grandson tried to get his luggage back the airline representative laughed and said come back tomorrow. The next day he revived a text at 10:45 am informing him that he had to be at the airport no later than 10 AM for a flight to Paris. I cancelled Royal Air Moroc and booked a flight on another airline, AirLingus.  We went to the airport and searched for his luggage for 3 hours.  Given a telephone number to call about his luggage. This number did not answer and the voice mail was full. The following day when i dropped him off for his flight on Aer Lingus I found out from another airline that I had to go to another terminal and file a lost luggage report with the contractor for lost luggage, which I did. Called Royal Air Moroc and gave them claim number. I repeatedly inquired by phone and email to no avail. 20 Days later Royal Air Moroc asking if my grandson had received his luggage.

RAM does not give you required customs paperwork to fill out ahead of time in flight. All other airlines do that for international flights. It is not a big ask.

"Two flights with RAM in two days proved to be two sides of the coin. The first a nightmare with a five hour delay as recorded previously, the second excellent in many ways including the early return arrival. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde maybe ? Good, attentive service on the way back (OK, there were only four passengers in Business), plenty of legroom (OK, the seats are a little dated), pretty decent food (with the major bonus of a great cheese board and a delightful selection of whole fresh fruit) and drink. If there are no hiccups there is no doubt that RAM has a better offering - with a friendlier and more authentic welcome - in Business than BA, at least short haul.

"RAM turned out to be worse than BA when the operational wheels came off. Even though the airline had my contact details I was not advised there would be a significant delay (the inbound plane had not left Morocco when I checked in at Heathrow). The cause of the delay was not clear (ground staff mentioned a strike, RAM subsequently cited operational problems), the timing of the flight was not clear and whether there would be any knock on effect for the return journey was not clear. Three hours after departure time passengers were offered a GBP 10 voucher which had to be collected from the transfer desk which is hidden away (corridor near Burberry's and down one flight of stairs). Eventually, the plane departed five hours late.
To be fair to the crew they were very apologetic, the turnaround was relatively quick and the pilots pulled out all the stops to make up time, but when you get to bed in Casablanca at 3am and have to leave the hotel for work five hours later, the unnecessary delay and the stress of having incomplete and uncertain information do not make for a happy camper.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/60/avatar038.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianloader,adrianloader wrote a review Jan 2018,adrianloader,"London, United Kingdom",518 contributions,233 helpful votes,London - Casablanca,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r557569689-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,plane-wrecked,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew Royal Air Morac from Cairo to JFK with a 12 hour layover in Casablanca where our baggage was to change planes as well. I don't think my luggage ever got on the plane in Cairo. When we were checking in, the conveyer belt was broken, and all the baggage was piled in front of the check-in desk. I have lost luggage before. It happens, but not like this. It's always come home. I was told (by Royal Air Morac) that I had to wait 21 days before I could file a claim or report with the airline directly. That was in July, when my luggage was lost. By that time I had very little faith my bag would be found. So I had gathered all my receipts and documentation and was ready to go. They told me it should be settled within 30 days.

It is now almost Feb, 2018. almost 7 months. Not only have they not dealt with this in any way, but at one point when I called I was told they had closed my case! I yelled a bit and asked to speak to a manager (yes I was calling Moracco) and they reopened it. I had been calling every other week and sending email to the address provided, and on that day I was told the best way to stay in touch and reach them was through facebook messenger. REALLY??? Facebook Messenger? They asked me for the ump-teenth time for my baggage claim number. and I sent it via facebook messenger.

Every day I message them. Everyday they tell me they will pass my message to the proper department, whom I was told doesn't have a phone number or a person for me to speak with, or a direct email for me to contact. I can only respond to their email. Which STILL goes to customer service and is then sent to""the person taking care of my case""

This morning I sent a strongly worded message asking them NOT to contact ""the correct department"" but to contact their supervisors manager. I was told they would send an urgent message. HA!!

I DID receive an email relatively soon afterwards, asking for my baggage claim number. I lost my mind.

I sent it again, and then another email containing all the receipts and screenshots of purchases I had sent before. Just in case. That bag and its contents were worth somewhere in the area of $2500. I would rather have the contents than the money, some of it is irreplaceable. But, I am quite certain the bag walked off months ago.

The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They do nothing. I doubt they pass my information on to anyone. They have no information to give me. It is basically an answering service.

"Literally loved this airline.
Emails and updates were fast and efficient whenever there were any types of changes

We boarded the plane pretty quickly, the flight attendants were warm and welcoming. One even woke me up from my nap to see if I wanted anything to eat or drink. I was checked on during the flight to make sure I was okay and asked if I needed anything. The flight crew were all smiles.
Seats were a little tattered on the plane, but still very comfortable. It was obviously an older plane but the seats were very roomy, nothing like you see in the USA.

"The flight was from London to Sao Paulo with a connection in Casblanca. The flight left two hours late from London but I was assured by staff that the connecting flight would also be late. We missed the flight in Casablanca and were told initially we couldn't get another for three days. We were then told to collect our bags before we could receive a hotel voucher. After waiting for my bag for over 6 hours (without even being offered water), I decided to give up and just go to the hotel. I was hungry and exhausted and had been in tears for how I was treated. The manager took so long to help us and sent us on to other people and one of the younger managers was really scary (male). I was stranded and alone. The girls on the conveyor belt left as I was in tears (after hours of waiting for my bag).

"NEVER EVER FLY THIS AIRLINE, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BUSINESS OR ECONOMY
I need to preface this review with saying I travel a good amount internationally, mostly economy and am not a picky person but this airline was the worst I have ever had to deal with (and I have flown economy via Spirt, thai lion, Ryan Air, etc).
Myself and a coworker flew home from a business trip in Madrid, the flight had a layover in Casablanca. We flew business and checked our bags priority. During the flight from Casablanca to JFK, neither my tv nor my coworkers worked, the attendants would try and restart them every 20 mins to see if they could get them to work but the entire flight neither of our tvs worked. My coworkers chair broke twice and had to be repaired, it was not even positioned correctly for landing. We finally get off the plane to find my luggage is lost. I make a lost luggage claim and return home. My luggage contained all of my business clothes and remained lost for 2.5 weeks. I was forced to buy new clothes for work. The customer service at this airline was terrible, they were rude and they kept telling me to send an email (which never gets answered). When the bag was finally delivered it was demolished and many of the contents ruined. I called and called and emailed...No luck. I finally received an email saying that they would not replace or reimburse because the bag wasn't claimed damaged within 7 days of my flight ......THATS BECAUSE IT WAS LOST!

"I've traveled to many countries with several airlines, however I have never experience such poor customer service and lack of accountability like I did with AirMaroc. They initially canceled my flight from Gambia to NY due to the snow storm, however it was back to normal the very next day. I value my safety first therefore I didn't mind at all because I thought I would be on the next plane available. I was initially suppose to return on the 7th but Airmarco decided to rebook me for the 15th (8 days after) because ""all flights were full"" without even contacting me. The also failed to remove my bag from the flight to Morocco (connecting location) so I was left with no cloths except for what I was already wearing. It was my first time in Gambia and was super exited to be their for a wedding but they defiantly ruined the trip for me. They promised to send my luggage back to Gambia since I was  going to be there for an additional week but they later told me that my bag was accidentally sent to NY. Here I am left with no cloths and expected to stay an additional week with no where to go. They first refused to provide me a hotel but I had to go back and forth to the office before they agreed to provide me one. They also refused to provide me $ to buy new cloths or to reimburse me since they sent my bag to the wrong location. I had no choice but to go to the market and buy new cloths. Long story short, when I got to NY and asked for my bag that was sent over a week ago, THEY COULDN'T FIND MY BAG, 4 or 5 other passengers were also there looking for their lost bags. I then had to file a claim which took 4-5 days to locate and send my bag home. I understand flights get canceled and bags get misplaced but Airmarco's actions to resolved the issue was unheard of for me. Defiantly the worst airlines I have ever experienced and will NEVER fly with them again.

"What a disaster- our connecting flight from Casablanca to JFK ( after traveling from Dakar to Casablanca) was cancelled at the gate at 2AM after many hours delay. In the scramble, no instructions or information was given. We were at the end of the line and they ran out of hotel vouchers. We had to pay for our hotel during this unexpected lay -over of 5 days. RAM lost our bags as they were loaded in Dakar. Writing this on 1/19 and there is no word on the 3 lost bags fro our family. We had to buy clothing and etc to make it through the say in Casablanca. RAM insists they do not give vouchers or any coverage for losses, but we have submitted a claim nonetheless. They said they could not put us on a flight to JFK until January 16 ( 10 days later.) Frustrated at both the RAM office in Casablanca and at the airport, we decided to buy new tickets home on Iberia due to job and school considerations ( we could not afford a 10 day wait for obvious reasons of employment and school). RAM refuses to reimburse for lost flight and new tickets home, hotel stay and clothing purchased. Rude and unhelpful staff at RAM office NYC saying that we should submit a claim but also that RAM does not have  policy to pay any claims as this was an "" Act of God"" ( weather cancellation) and we are ""not unique"". Then they encouraged us to make a claim on their website....really bizarre customer relations...I have they feeling no one there takes responsibility or knows what they are doing....I'll NEVER fly RAM again and will tell everyone I know to avoid this poorly run airline.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doneganstudio,Cheryl D wrote a review Jan 2018,Cheryl D,"New York City, New York",9 contributions,9 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r554791521-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"OVERALL DISASTER - Connecting  Flight Canceled on 1/6/18- lost bags, no hotel voucher, no refund",Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew business class from New York to Casablanca and return, in December. The plane was fairly new, being a dreamliner (albeit the early and smaller version). At JFK you gain entrance to the Air France lounge, which is nice enough. We departed on time, although our return flight was about an hour late arriving. Service was fine/friendly. Food was nothing to write home about with the fish looking tired even before putting a fork to it. The screen was big and looked good, but movie selection was ok with several current movies but very limited. Seats felt a touch tight, with a poor layout (e.g. no pockets to put things).

"Royal is possibly the worst airline I've ever flown in my life. On my first flight with them from London to Casablanca I sat on the emergency exit. The left arm rest was cut in half and sealed with tape (as you're able to see in the attached picture). Staff was rude and even though we said we didn't speak French and asked for information in English, they insisted in speak to us in French. The following flight from Casablanca to Sao Paulo was no better. I was sat on row 32 and by the time the food trolley reached us, there was only fish as the meat was finished. I had a return flight to London with them today but I'm still no where near there as there was a ""technical issue"" (which they failed to explained what it was) with the aircraft and the flight was cancelled. We have been sent to a hotel and have to wait for further instructions while they fix the aircraft.

So my advice is: DO NOT EVER FLY WITH ROYAL AIR MAROC unless you want to be mistreated, have bad food and an old, horrible aircraft.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciacT6437DT,Patricia C wrote a review Jan 2018,Patricia C,"London, United Kingdom",33 contributions,36 helpful votes,Sao Paulo - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r552216768-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Bad service, food and broken aircraft",Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I upgraded to business for the third and last leg of our trip to Marrakech, having had a long day behind us with two flights on the same day to get to Casablanca. We were expecting some comfort and perhaps a little special treatment, maybe a drink in the lounge... Got zero, nothing! The lounge was small and not particularly appealing. They had no alcohollic drinks either, so we decided to leave and go to the general cafeteria, where we bought ourselves refreshing beers. Yes, they had them! Go figure.
The worst was yet to come. There's no priority boarding, or priority anything attached to the business class, just masses welling around, everyone pushing and shoving. We ended up being the last on the plane and the last off the plane, due to the fact that the only door was at the back of the aircraft and our seats in row 1. The masses had won, they got in first (I'm not good at pushing people, even though - I must say - sometimes it's tempting!) To top it all, our priority stickered and labelled bags were the very last ones to arrive on the carousel at the other end!!! If I hadn't experienced all this, I would not have believed it possible.
The plane was one of their small propeller aircrafts (could have been exotic under different circumstances). There was no difference between business and economy seats except for the curtain in between. I wonder what purpose it had, both sides of curtain were identical, in comfort and in service.
Hand luggage shelves in the front were full when we arrived. Our seats were in the first row with emergency exit, so of course I couldn't even keep my hanbag with me. I suggested to the people behind me to take their small flat package from above and put it at their feet - general practice. I was screamed at for touching their property! Whoa. The steward rushed in and proceeded to place my handbag somewhere way back in economy side, totally out of my sight! I was so dishartened at this stage that I couln't even argue, just sat down, dazed. Luckily my partner intervened and managed to get the bag and shove it on top of some other bags above us. The steward was not a pleasant one, I'm sorry to say. While waiting to disembark, I noticed it was his extra uniform with its cap and his large bag that took a lion's share of the shelf space!
That was it. No service, no priority, nothing at all to show for the fact that I'd paid €155 extra - for the joy of getting upset?!
So if you're flying Royal Air Maroc in their small propeller aircraft, please save your money and do not be tempted to go business, you'll get absolutely nothing for your money, nothing at all. Economy is way cheaper and getting in and out of the plane gets easier the further back you sit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mea1,mea1 wrote a review Jan 2018,mea1,"Helsinki, Finland",19 contributions,10 helpful votes,Casablanca - Marrakech,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r552190086-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,This was a very bad experience,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Our flight was delayed leaving Gatwick and landed 5 minutes before our connecting flight was due to leave. The plane did not wait and then next flight was in two days time. They put us up in a hotel that claimed it was 4* but it did not provide any drinking water or complimentary toothbrushes etc.  This was a problem because Air Maroc could not give us our bags.  For two days I kept returning to the airport to be told that they had our bags and I should wait 30 mins. I did this for about 4 or 5 hours each day and they were never able to produce our bags. They were not apologetic and they did not seems to care.  No one would talk to us about provided money for toiletries or  clothes or even laundry so we could clean  the clothes we had on. The service was appalling and the staff were unhelpful and apathetic at best.

We flew from JFK with a long layover in Casablanca on our way to Rome.  Very nice flight.  Seating tight as any economy class.  Our return was out of Bologna and also through Casablanca.  We were supposed to have a 2+ hour layover and then on to JFK.  I couldn't find our outbound flight listed in Casablanca to JFK and upon asking was told there were no more flights that evening.  I shared we had booked a flight 8+ months ago to JFK for that evening.  They informed me the flight was cancelled.  mmmm thanks for telling me.

"The flight itself was satisfactory and all the RAM staff were good.  I would take issue with the airport however.  After passing through security and emigration, we had another security check at the departure gate.  They did a spot check on passengers, examining their carry-on luggage by hand.  Very inefficient, resulting in some delay.  I would suggest that passengers take only a few items in their carry-on luggage to minimise the disruption.I have no complaints about the fare but if travelling to Morocco, people may want to note that it can be cheaper to fly to Marrakech rather than Casablanca.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16jamesdoc,16jamesdoc wrote a review Jan 2018,16jamesdoc,"London, United Kingdom",636 contributions,271 helpful votes,Casablanca - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r551098427-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,From their Casa to my casa,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew business class from JFK to Marrakech, with a connection in Casablanca. First, we were 2 hours late from JFK so I missed my connection. I kept asking the stewardess what to do if I miss my flight and she just kept lying to me and said I would make it. After arriving very late in Casablanca I had to get moved to a later flight, and asked them twice if my bag would go on the next flight - they said yes. I arrived to Marrakech very late and no bag. I filed a lost bag request with the baggage office and he said they would call when it came - he was very rude by them way. 2 WEEKS LATER AND STILL NO BAG!! I've called and have gone to their office almost every day and nothing, and no explanation. All these inept people can say is ""We don't know where it is right now"". Since this happened, I've spoken to at least 15 other people who have the same problem.

I was forced to go to the airport at my own time and expense to retrieve a completely destroyed suitcase.

"This is a sum up of several domestic flights I had with Royal Air Maroc in business class.
The good thing is that RAM brought me to where I wanted to fly and all flights were on time.
Domestic business class is a complete waste of money! The only thing one gets is priority check in and a dedicated cabin, which is no difference to economy class in ATRs, but offers better seats on E190s. And then there is this exclusive bus service at Casablanca airport is terribly run down busses. Save it, RAM! It’s nothing other airlines would dare to offer as business class product.
No lounges in most airports! Not even at RAM’s domestic hub in Casablanca! I only could use one at Tangier. Terrible displays and announcements at the airports which made me almost miss a flight because a gate change wasn’t announced and the staff only spoke Arab and French, but not English.
Inside the aircrafts, one is offered a small drink and that’s all. No meal service at all, no asking if one would like another drink. Announcements in English are terrible, not understandable, and on some flights they aren’t even made. The cabins are in poor conditions and dirty.
Don’t book business class!

"First impression is a slight upgrade from budget airlines as the flight included a hot meal. While I appreciated this , the meal was awful. They ran out of chicken so I ended up with beef. The pasta was overcooked and meat looked pale and tasteless . I simply only ate the bread roll and small pot of salad which was lovely. The seating was cramped, luckily I had 2 slim people on either side of me, otherwise I wouldn't know how I would of been able to sit throughout the flight! I found it strange that your hand luggage couldn't be fitted in the overhead lockers due to people storing other bags and boxes. This chaotic process delayed the flight and I question why passengers were allowed to bring on additional bags when they should have been encouraged to check in their hand luggage ( which my return flight with BAirways was the total opposite, with so much room and the flight was surprisingly much cheaper ) Once we landed in Casablanca en route to Marrekesh it took over 30 minutes to come off the plane due to passengers trying to get their stuff out of the over head lockers. Luckily we were in time for our connecting flight to Marrekesh. While the staff were nice , the flight was pretty uncomfortably and loud with people talking so loud. Also it would have been great if the sheets for immigration would be handed on flight.

"I booked a flight to travel with Royal air maroc from London to Marrakech - stopping off to change flight in Casablanca or so we thought!
There was 3 of us (adults) and 1 child (2).
Upon boarding the flight i was sweltering as it was extremely hot and the air con was just blowing out hot air it was extremely uncomfortable but little did i know this was the least of my worries.
The reason i am giving this air line 1 star is simply because our connecting flight was the last flight of the day and the flight before ours was cancelled (apparently) so they gave our seats to the passengers who was waiting before us!!! There was alot of commotion and shouting but as i do not speak to language i was not sure what was going on - it was a passenger who relayed the information to me as the staff said they do not speak english ... riiight?
To cut a lolng story short the manager on duty shut the door on me and went into her office they did not offer us any apology or any refreshments after we had been waiting over 6 hours, what they did supply however was a small mini van which infact had a slow puncture as we had to stop to pump up the wheel as it had gone completely flat which is very dangerous.
I have been trying to contact them for a refund and compensation and they are not responding, so would defo reccommend not to even bother with this air line - i have had more enjoyale experiences on Ryan Air and Easy Jet to be honest!",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbcaramel,mbcaramel wrote a review Dec 2017,mbcaramel,"London, United Kingdom",39 contributions,11 helpful votes,London - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r549727997-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,The worst airline i have ever flown with - will NEVER use again!,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Twice a year, I take Air Maroc. The flight I take is from Kinshasa to Brussels and back, since I am a Belgian citizen working in Kinshasa. The food is pretty average. I would like to see more couscous and Moroccan food. Yesterday, they had only beef and fish. I am mostly vegetarian, so this wasn't to my taste. Why don't they have a vegetarian option? Come on, we are in the 21st century, only young children and ignorant people don't know that half of the pollution in this world is caused by the meat industry. Why serve only tasteless fish and red meat? And why do they avoid couscous? It doesn't make sense. Couscous is not only good for Moroccans, it's good for everybody!

The service is pretty efficient. If you ask for a glass of water or anything else, they won't forget you. In Casablanca, you don't necessarily have to queue. If your connecting flight is only one hour after you have arrived or even less, don't worry, the staff will let you go through the gates without queuing. It is well organized. Thumbs up!

What I don't like about this airline, or at least on my particular flight, is that they don't have TVs on board. So if you are on a ten-hour flight, you won't have much entertainment since you can't watch a movie. If you can sleep easily, that won't be a problem, but if you can't you'd better come with a good book or a good pal.

What I like about the airline is that you can buy duty free Moroccan products such as the wonderful argan oil on board. It is very convenient to make presents once you reach your destination, especially when you come from central African countries where there isn't much to buy!",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steeve17,Steeve wrote a review Dec 2017,Steeve,"Kigali, Rwanda",4027 contributions,591 helpful votes,Kinshasa - Brussels,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r548531364-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,A Pleasant Flight,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had two flights on Royal Air Maroc.. They do not coordinate with any Us carriers on their frequent flier programs. I had been flying business class but they did not offer that to us. Check in at Fes was a made scramble and the airport in Casablanca was a free for all scrum, extremely poor coordination . Service was minimal on he airline which was half full from fes to casablanca and packed going to Barcelona.They are efficient but very cheap in the foods and snacks and lack of room on the plane on both flights.  I was very happy to deplane and get more comfortable. Look for another airline if you want some comfortable seats but going to Barcelona from Casablanca it is limited.

"I read a lot of bad reviews about Royal Air Maroc and I can tell you that we had a very pleasant flight. The staff was very courteous and accommodating. The one thing I could not figure out was how to book seats on the flight. I don't know if this had to do with the fact that we booked via Expedia. My husband and I were separated on one flight but that was okay. We are adults and can deal with that. However, if you have children that would be a concern.The food wasn't that great but what airline food is? The airport in Morocco is lacking. It was very strange having to take a shuttle bus to the main terminal. The terminal does not have any good restaurants and just appears tired and somewhat dirty.

Not to mention the horrible customer care, the gentleman on the phone basically told me that either I was gonna take that flight or I’ll have to pay for a new one. And on top of that, he wouldn’t let me talk to a manager. The only bright side to this, was the second guest relation who I talked to. She was able to book me in the Flight from Ny.

"A Wonderful ' Little Dream Airline '.

The staff are Absolutley Multi-lingual they know 'at lease' 5 languages each which is Intelligent as well as Impressive and Welcoming!

The moment I went on board I was to feel Safe & Comfortable with a Peaceful Journey, Everyone is always Respectful & Well behaved.

Food is Abundant and no one is left un waited or ignored, thirsty or Hungry!

The Experience is mostly Smooth from U.K to The African Continent but know they fly all over, which is why I will choose them again.

The Captains are from all over the world which is beautiful and makes me feel Safe and Hosts/Hostesses are always polite.

The cabins are always clean and you never feel rushed or pressuerd, your holiday starts on board with them, truly:)

The Attentiveness is smashing, even in Economy class the Standard is that They give a 1st Class SERVICE who ever you are and always with a 'REAL SMILE'
I love RAM ( Royal Air Marco ) Best REAL airline in the World where everyone is on the Same Level!

'By the way' this Airline line Attracts the most INTERESTING people in the World who have very Interesting and INSPIRATIONAL lives, and you wouldn't' think so unless you flew with them!

"I have flown Royal Air Maroc on several occasions to visit with my family in Morocco. Until recently, I have never really experienced a problem. This last trip to Morocco was absolutely terrible. Upon arriving in the air port, I realized one of my suitcases was missing and when I alerted the air line, they seemed as though they didn’t care, came off as very rude, and even lied to me about the whereabouts of where my suitcase could be. I was appalled. Traveling with my family, to see our family went from wonderful to devastating in an instant. Most of my expensive belonging were in that specific suitcase, and I’m so angry that Royal Air Maroc would treat a guest  such as myself, as poorly as they did. They should have taken immediate action to locate my suitcase and make sure I was satisfied with the end result. Here it is almost two months from the day I was unable to find my suitcase and I have not heard anything whatsoever from Royal Air Maroc.

"After reading many bad reviews of RAM I️ was a little nervous to fly with them, but have to say flights were on time and smooth, hot meals served even on flights under 3 hours, bags arrived undamaged, and flight attendants were fine. There happened to be medical emergencies on two different flights I️ had with them and they handled them very attentively and professionally. RAM is really no different than any other budget carrier- you won’t get a luxurious experience, but you will get there and it will be just fine.

The issue is the Casablanca airport. I️ can’t speak for other Moroccan airports, but this one requires a ton of patience and is very dysfunctional. There are several redundant passport/bag checks and long lines. Right before boarding everything in my bag was completely inspected again- electronics all taken out and examined, etc., probably for the third time at that point. They also don’t tell you that any drinks you buy past security in the airport terminal can’t come on board. However that rule seemed to apply to me and not everyone- so there are some of those totally arbitrary security quirks that are not uncommon of other international airports of course, but are definitely a problem in Casablanca. Just beware that if you are connecting in Casablanca to flights elsewhere, give yourself lots of extra time and be attentive to everything. They don’t provide any clear instruction on their airport policies.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L3897FCclaireg,Claire G wrote a review Nov 2017,Claire G,,11 contributions,9 helpful votes,Washington DC - Paris,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r543591587-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,RAM isn’t the problem- it’s the Casablanca airport ,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"As travelers who needed Assistance we were offered better seats at Manchester airport and were nicely surprised by a tasty meal on the way to Casablanca. The Assistance was waiting for us there but the plane wasn't ready for boarding so we were transported miles across the airport to wait with crowds of standing people for boarding to Marrakech. The plane was late one hour so it should be enough to transfer our suitcase from one plane to another. But it wasn't and we couldn't collect our luggage at Marrakech. Being naive I trusted the employee of Lost & Found that it would come on next plane in 45 minutes and I didn't request a claim protocol. When the plane landed without our suitcase the Lost&Found office was closed.It was almost midnight. A taxi waited for us 2 hours (extra night cost) and we reached hotel with no luggage. The next day another Lost&Found clerk showed me the suitcase on another flight table but he didn't seem to do anything to get the luggage as soon as possible (another cost of taxi). A long while after all the luggage of the flight were dispatched our suitcase was still unavailable. I needed to show my impatience to see any action. If you can avoid transfer at Casablanca, do it. I wonder who is responsible to compensate us additional costs of taxis ?",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malgorzatar598,Malgorzata R wrote a review Nov 2017,Malgorzata R,"Warsaw, Poland",208 contributions,39 helpful votes,Manchester - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r543446613-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,RAM good airline with BAD/NO support of RAM Handling at Casablanca,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After reading of these bad reviews. Allow me to bring some sought of balance to this discussion...  First and foremost I'm old enough to remember traveling abroad use to be a pipedream vacation. The 1-800 travel to Europe commercials with astronomical prices are no longer.  Thank goodness! today you can act as your own agent with so many sites playing host to these budget airlines.  Key word here ""budget ""  RAM is no different from any other airline. We are a family of four with two teenage girls.. We were able to fly to Lisbon, Madrid and Casablanca one shot all under 2k. So I had very little expectations other than transportation of getting us there. My low expectations were exceeded with great movie selections, friendly FAs and really good food. Allow me to help calm your nerves if you just booked and are scared itless reading these bad reviews.Do's- book a flight with multiple destinations with a long layover... why? RAM offers complimentary accommodations. Yes that's right free! For bookings with a 8 hour or more layover.. Get out see Casablanca and visit  the Hassan Mosque which might be one of the best landmarks in the world.. Two continents for the price of one with a free night stay. .. How is that a bad thing on any level? Don't- here's where things get messy.. Not RAM but the Casablanca airport is a nightmare. You will literally probably spend the entire time going through 50 million security checks once re-entering the airport.  So do not try to play daredevil with time.. This is where most of these bad reviews stem from, travelers visiting a country they are not familiar with playing a game of roulette with their time. I watched 10 different travelers upset because they missed their flight because they got caught on traffic.  Do not... I repeat... do not tightrope it. Casablanca traffic is like a scene on Homeland it's extremely chaotic. It's simple book a long layover or just relax until your next flight..  All in all I'm not sure what ppl expect, to each its own.. However if you are a budget traveler, this airline will work for you.  We did have a minor layover but nothing crazy..  That stuff happens on any airline especially traveling abroad.. RAM like most airlines get a bum rap because of one person bad experience.  Traveling so far away opens up so many different scenarios that can go wrong.  Do not panic you'll be fine. You are listening to a traveler that is level headed and open minded. No axe to grind, just helping my fellow travelers.  Remember if anything goes wrong you'll be taking care of..

As a Business Class customer I expect a certain level of service. My first mistake apart from flying Royal Air Moroc was booking direct on their website.

After spendeingnAUD300 in phone calls I was promised a refund which never came. If you desperately need to fly this airline use a travel agent so they can atleast process a refund.

"Having read the reviews for RAM I had low expectations for my journey; worried about delays, lost luggage and on board service, I was very pleasantly surprised.

For a more affordable price and a shorter journey than other options, I flew from Montreal to Madrid with a stopover in Casablanca aboard RAM. I was allowed two checked luggage’s, given two meals and enough leg space to sit as comfortable as it gets on a plane. There was entertainment for the 6 hour flight and the plane was well kept.

Overall similar to the experience I’ve had on other, more well-know airlines transatlantic flights.

"I flew from NY - JFK to CMN and then back 9 days later. The flight out of NY was uneventful. I tried to contact the airline a day in advance of my flight to choose a seat- only to find out the E ticket number was not in the right format. I didn't fret - I was traveling with a group of 26 others and planned to arrive at the airport 3 hours in advance in order to choose my seat. As suspected the airline chose my seat. Upon arrival to JFK I checked in and was able to change my seat to an aisle seat 4 rows form the back of the plane.  Prior to taking off I noticed that a gentleman was seated in the middle row ( 3 seats speaking with the crew) Once the pilot announced the plan was ready for take off the gentlemen moved up 2 rows to another row of empty 3 seats. A friend rushed to the last row and was told the seats are being held for the crew. My friend sat in the 2nd to last row on one aisle and I moved into the aisle seat with a space in between us. This worked out well. I noticed the crew advised passengers to use the restroom at the middle of the plane. The plane allows passengers to walk down one aisle around the back of the plane and back up the opposite aisle. I had NO idea there was a bathroom at the back of the plane until we were about to land. There was no smell AT all! The crew were ok and werent very pleasant. The food was edible and warm. I had a chicken dinner. The flight was a 9 pm take off and a 8 am arrival in CMN so we were served breakfast as well! All in all a good flight both ways. Although on my flight back - the crew separated a family of 7, luckily they had some aisle seats in an exit row and I gladly traded my seat.    PS I did read reviews about the lost luggage and decided to check 1 bag and carry on another just in case. I had no problem with lost luggage in either direction.

"Royal Air Maroc changed the departure time of my traveler (EMD Economist) by over 6 hours and did not notify us of the change! Not only would my traveler have not made the flight, but their business trip, and all the meetings scheduled with Government officials would have been missed!

Then, 3 days later, they change her return, and again, did not notify us! We had to book a whole new ticket on another airline! These horrible practices cost our firm an additional $3,200.

"At Marrakesh airport. What a no logical and bad customer experience!  One desk to check in (economy) for more than 150 people waiting. E-tickets, don’t waste your time, it’s useless cause they don't accept e-tickets on the Marrakech airport and you still have to wait for a longggg time in line; expect at least an hour to get other tickets than e-ticktet.

"Check in went well, very little queing. The female assistant, who insisted in helping me checking in manually, confirmed I had a place next to the emergency exit in the plane (I am tall) : I ended up sitting one row further.
Once at the gate, the situation got bad. Very crowded, three doors next to each other, all three boarding at the same time to three different destinations. No need to say more??
Service on board was ok, flight comfort as well (good and experienced pilot I'd say, a very smooth landing). Lunch was mediocre; way too much sauce - not the best I ever had in the air.

"I flew from Washington DC Dulles Airport to Casablanca Morocco. The aircraft was absolutely dirty and smelly. A kingdom of all sorts of germs. A tick layer of pretty old dust was sitting on the carry-on luggage compartment. The whole airplane smelled awfully like a public toilet. The lavatories were very smelly and very messy.
Only one or two crew members were more or less helpful and caring, the rest of them were extremely rude and had no patience.
The only positive thing is the job well done by their pilots. Very smooth landing and takeoff.
The only reason why I chose this company is for the convenience of a direct flight. Otherwise I would have avoided it like the plague - which I should probably start doing.
Would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend this company to anyone. Unless you don't mind the appalling dirtiness and the rude people who work there.

"I've bought the returned ticket from Moscow to Casablanca at Royal Air Maroc office in Moscow on May, 30th. The flight from Moscow to Casablanca was economic class on September, 20th and everything was good - registration, service at the airplane etc. But when after my trip to Marocco I arrived at Casablanca airport  two hours before my flight on September, 27th, I've been told by person from Royal Air Maroc at business class registration desk, that my family name and my ticket number were not at the airline's system and it's my problem!!! I've showed my electronic ticket but the person said me again that there were no my family name and send me to make confirmation of my ticket to the office. When I came to the office, there were 8 people, among them two Russian women. They were told exactly the same words about their tickets. It's radiculious, because we all were at the system when we flew 7-10 days before to Casablanca. It was very strange that our names have disappeared from the system. The person from the office have checked my name at his computer and I've seen that it was information about my ticket. Then he asked me what is the problem? I said that I should confirm my ticket. He has begun to phone somewhere regarding my ticket. Nobody answered for ages. When somebody had finally answered, the person has given me phone to speak but the person on line has said to me that he didn't speak English and then he's put my call on hold again. The person from the office has called again. Nobody has answered. For one hour the person has tried to call somewhere to confirm my ticket. In Moscow was night already, so Moscow Royal Air Maroc office didn't work. The same time the person at Casablanca office forced two Russian women to buy 2 business class tickets for 850 euro each. They had connection flight at Moscow to fly to Krasnodar, that was why they agreed to pay. Otherwise we all should pay for the 2 nights at the hotel, because Royal Air Maroc wouldn't do it as we were not at the system and we weren't sure that we would appear on next flight. It was women's last money. My two way ticket (one way - economy class, returned way - business class) costs only 634 euro. I was so stressed and powerless because I understood that I couldn't prove later that I came to airport on time for my flight. Now I realized the words of woman at registration desk why that's ""my problem"", because I couldn't do anything and I was scared. I'd tried to persuade the person at the office to but nothing had worked until I've said ""I'm American citizen and will judge Air Royal Maroc company in USA"" The person at office immediately has said that he found my name at the airline's system snd I could go to the registration desk to get a boarding pass. When I get into business class salon, it was full of Africans with economic class tickets. And I've realized that it was unrighteous way not to pay for the hotel for overbooked Moroccan people and chock Russian tourists to pay for the hotel by yourself or buy tickets, that brings money for the company- it's outrageous! The service was awful. The  stewardess thrown me slippers and when I asked for glass of wine or champagne, because I was very nervous, she told me, that she would bring it after taking off. She forgot to bring lamb for main course to my neighbor. I traveled around the world by different airlines and I was in more than 40 countries, but this experience was the worst in my life.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oksanab425,OKsana B wrote a review Oct 2017,OKsana B,"Moscow, Russia",25 contributions,14 helpful votes,Casablanca - Moscow,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r528754284-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Attention!

"What an experience, even tough the flight went ok, I am really shocked of my journey today.

At the arrival in the terminal, a whole bunch of passengers were nearly punching each other after some of them got check-in declined due to flight overbooking. Company staff and airport representative stupidly stared at the show.

Few moment later, when I arrived at the boarding gates, I saw another group of passengers yelling that their flight to Bologna had departed too early. Some passengers were knocking the boarding gates, asking the staff to reopen them; another one was repeatedly loudly shouting ""is there any manager left in this airport"". Once again, the airline representatives kept quietly looking at their customers rage, while passengers waiting to board on other flight were recording the scene on their phone.

Then, we heard an alarm coming from the elevator to the RAM lounge, and the noise of someone in panic, blocked inside, knocking the elevator door. As airport representatives started to gather around the elevator, we were called for our boarding to London.

The flight itself was decent, the best part being the meal served (cold starter, hot dish, dessert, cheese, bread, free 33cl cola, coffee/tea)... until the landing... At very high speed, left wheels hardly hit the ground first (some people started to shout and remained nervous until the complete stop of the aircraft).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lomil22,lomil22 wrote a review Sep 2017,lomil22,"London, United Kingdom",1 contribution,,Casablanca - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r527111493-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,You better have a very good sense of humour,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We decided to take the airline to save cost and pre-booked our flight in February to get early bird tickets. The 1st shock came in July when we randomly checked our online booking and saw that our dates had been moved forward thereby adding a 29 hour layover without any notice! We rushed to their Lagos office to sort that out.

The day before takeoff, we got an sms asking that we be at the airport at least 4 hours before takeoff - which meant at least 2am for a 6.40am flight. The onboarding from Lagos was the worst I'd ever experienced - long queues, no information provided, delayed take-off.

The other leg to New York was actually good - attentive cabin crew, good legroom etc.

Flight back to Lagos from Casablanca was a nightmare - small plane compared to the waiting passengers, shared no inflight entertainment and more importantly, cabin crew struggled to communicate in English. Only 2 toilets serving almost 120 people.

This is the only flight I've been on where there was no priority boarding for families travelling with children.

Its a 3 rating because it was low budget and the airport in Casablanca wasn't half bad.

So if you must fly RAM, (1) don't fly them in summer as they always overbook (2) If you must go in summer, periodically check your booking and be sure that its not changed (3) just assume your flight will be uncomfortable and make adequate preparations (well charged tablets/laptop, snacks for the kids, good book).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/89/01/b3/tempest872.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tempest872,tempest872 wrote a review Sep 2017,tempest872,"Lagos, Nigeria",29 contributions,10 helpful votes,Lagos - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r525988594-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Low budget airline, mixed bag",Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"- Check in: disorganized but reasonably ok.
- Departure: delayed 45 minutes with no explanations given. We were asked to line up for boarding and left standing for 40 minutes. No explanations were given.

Arrival: All our checked luggage, along with that of at least other 20 passengers, did not arrive. The staff had no idea what to do and did not seem to care at all. We were told to come back to the airport the following afternoon. The following morning, none of the telephones given worked and there was no way for us to check if our bags had arrived. We had asked for our bags to be forwarded to our next stop which they agreed. We continued to try to track them via phone with no luck at all. The only response we got from the airline was through Facebook!!! On our second stop and 48 hours into this odyssey, we were made to go to the local airport to pick the bags up (they simply do not deliver to your hotel like others do) where we were told that only two out of three bags had arrived. The man who was in charge only said ""I am sorry, I did not loose them, this is not my problem"". The only thing he managed to do was to request for the remaining bag to be forwarded to another location if found. At this point we had called several times, had done spend hours at two airports and had had our relatives call to their US office. Our tour operator was finally able to speak to someone on the phone and told us where the bag was. We were finally able to retrieve it 5 days later. When went to pick it up, it was locked and whoever had the key to the room, made us wait another hour. Of course, no one seemed to care.

I strongly advise against using this airliner on your flights to Morocco. I guess that everything goes smoothly it's ok but they clearly have a company culture that does not care about customer service or satisfaction. They will not help you if anything does not go according to plan.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jmortegal,Jmortegal wrote a review Aug 2017,Jmortegal,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",24 contributions,7 helpful votes,Madrid - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r520067888-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Terrible, more like non existent, customer service",Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Royal air Maroc is only direct flight to Montreal so we chose to  fly with them on our summer vacation for last couple of  years. This trip was a disaster,  we got email 4 hours prior to trip informing they are aircraft had a technical issue and we were not to go to airport till further notice.  Only 2 hours before the flight we get an email saying they got a replacement aircraft and we should be at airport on time .  Luckily we were close to airport other wise we would have missed.  Upon boarding we discovered that aircraft was in real bad shape.  rIt was real old one,  with no reclining seats and no form of any entertainment, no video or audio system. @ out of 3 bathrooms were out service and they crew staff were in real bad mood too.  To top it all the food was hideous and it was so obvious they were not ready for this flight. by end of flights the aircraft was so dirty , bathrooms smelled and when we complained the staff told us it is not there fault and we should complain to management. This was by far the most horrible flight i eve took and i am a heavy frequent flyer for work and pleasure and have a gold status with RAM as well. they really need to look at their strategy and upgrading their aircraft and training their staff in they want to stay and compete in the airline business!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danddana,Danddana wrote a review Aug 2017,Danddana,"Casablanca, Morocco",51 contributions,8 helpful votes,Casablanca - Montreal,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r519846401-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Horrible flight, old disfunctional aircraft and worst service ever",Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"These four RAM flights were my first since 2009. I had low expectations due to experiences a decade ago, but I was very positively impressed by the current quality of service, punctuality, attentive ground service, and courtesy in resolving a baggage issue. To start at the beginning, the website is now user-friendly. Check-in at JFK was handled much better than eight years ago. It was quick and efficient. Although I had to arrive six hours early to JFK due to limited flights from my US point of origin, I could proceed directly after security to the Air France lounge until flight time.      The cabin interior has been completely refurbished, with lie-flat seats, an adequate entertainment system, and attentive service.The flight from JFK departed at 9:00 PM and dinner wasn't served until 10:15 or 10:30 at night. I chose the national dish, a cous-cous dinner with chicken. The chicken had the softness of a dish prepared for an infant and preparation could be improved. The return meal from Casablanca, and the lunches served on the short Tunis-Casablanca flights, on the other hand, were delicious and well-presented.     Transfer at CMN was effortless. I was met plane side and provided with a room at an airport hotel until my mid-afternoon departure. On my return from Tunis, I stopped over for five days in Casablanca/Rabat. My bag arrived damaged—this can happen anywhere. I am still in the process of getting reimbursed for the damaged bag, but RAM staff in Morocco and via e-mail have been courteous if slow (Qatar Airways managed a claim earlier in the year within three weeks),       RAM cost was less than half what European carriers wanted for travel to Tunis, and the quality of service provided make RAM acompetitively-priced, reliable, and comfortable choice..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boujadi72,Boujadi72 wrote a review Aug 2017,Boujadi72,"White River Junction, Vermont",51 contributions,52 helpful votes,New York City - Tunis,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r519613779-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Major improvements and competitive pricing for Royal Air Maroc,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've flown RAM multiple times (probably 10+) and it just gets worse flight by flight. Customer service is near non-existent. Should you need to call for help with your reservation -- you will wait on hold for 45+ minutes and then speak with someone who speaks too quietly, and poorly to understand what they are saying.

The planes from US to Morocco, although new, are already dirty and unkept. On our last flight, my brother sat in a seat covered in a sticky drink and a big wad of gum smushed into the belt. The steward did nothing but provide him some tissues.

The last three rows in the back of the plane were filled with junk, papers, bags of blankets and pillows, etc. The crew would not allow passengers to occupy these seats after take off. We were not offered any drinks until two hours into flight, when dinner was served. Then after falling asleep -- I woke up about half way into the flight to find THE STAFF SLEEPING IN THE THREE EMPTY ROWS. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!

RAM staff will tell you when flying from CMN to US that your bags will go all the way through to your final destination. THIS IS FALSE. You must collect then in JFK --the last four times I've flown, they have given me this information which is incorrect.

The plane in general is disgusting by the time it reaches Morocco or the reverse. At no point do the staff come along with bags and try to minimize the trash build up. The bathroom was flooded and floor covered with towels. By 3/4 of the flight, you'll be lucky to have toilet paper available. It's absolutely disgusting.

After my last flight, and finding the crew asleep. I'm finished with them. Spend your money with another airline.

"We are astounded at the service we paid for. Upon arriving at the airport, we were told that our flight may be delayed or cancelled so we were going to be driven in a poorly ventilated bus to the destination airport.  When asked for a reason, the airline representative said sometimes there are too many people or maybe there's a technical problem, one of the two she assured us.  Then what was initially supposed to be a 2hr journey turned out to be a 3.5 one, the fellow 16 passengers crammed into the mini van were not impressed as everyone's connecting flight was nearing.  We finally arrived at the next airport 15minutes after our flight had started boarding. The driver just left us.  Luckily we found other passengers in the mini van on the same flight and were escorted through the airport, running to catch the plan.

Our hotel staff made countless attempts to reach the airline before finally making contact with our request. Then came the good part. When we really needed them Royal Air Maroc rose to the occasion and provided us with excellent support on both our returning flights. More plus points: price-wise they were very competitive, we had four flights and all of them were bang on time and the flight attendants were pleasant  and welcoming.

This flight via Casablanca, could have been so much better if the staff did their job. Sadly, they were indifferent to the passengers, and on at least one occasion, quite rude and dismissive.
The return flight was only slightly better, snacks and beverages offered. Yet the attitude of the staff was quite appalling.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100jules87,100jules87 wrote a review Aug 2017,100jules87,"Vancouver, Canada",9 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r518552853-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Don't expect inflight service, even though it is included!",Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"BUYER BEWARE. This is the WORST airline I have ever dealt with in over 100 flights, many with low cost carriers. I would spend the extra $ to be comfortable and have your luggage arrive with you. I knew it was going to be bad when the online system crashed every time we tried to pick our seats, when we finally called to have our seats set and my special meal requested it was challenging to get clear info. Then JFK to Casablanca the whole row of seats I was in on a completely full flight's entertainment systems went off during landed and never fixed. We kept asking the flight attendants who seemed to care less and I spent 8 hours next to an 11 year old whose family was spread throughout the plane with no entertainment. In addition they messed up my special meal so I couldn't eat anything. The plan itself was dirty. The leg of Casablanca to Marrakech and vice versa weren't too bad because they were shorter but somehow after requesting and confirming seats they got changed so my fiance and I were separated with no explanation as to why. The check-in process for luggage and boarding was chaotic and didn't function properly (for example one line would have 3 agents checking them in where another line would have one slow agent and they would yell at you if you tried to switch). To add to the awful experience when we got back to JFK only 1 of our 3 suitcases made it to us. A 2nd came in on the next flight, but was sent to us BY UPS not a courier so it took 3 DAYS TO ARRIVE!!! Luckily we were staying with family in New Jersey but it was ridiculous how long they took to get that suitcase to us, which is outshined only by the fact that for the first time after having flown well over 100 times my suitcase has never been returned to me. It's been over a month of calling and emailing and not getting any information while we try to get compensated for my suitcase. They barely pick up the phone and there claims service only interacts via email which they promise to respond to within 30 DAYS... That's right any email correspondence they strive to respond to within a month. Never again will I fly Royal Air Maroc.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201bethanyc,201bethanyc wrote a review Aug 2017,201bethanyc,,51 contributions,48 helpful votes,New York City - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r518518993-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Terrible Experience on multiple flights (we had 4 flights on a multi-city ticket),Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight was scheduled to take off at 9 pm. We boarded on time.  We ended getting off the aircraft at 1am after taxing and waiting at the terminal. Then we waited for another hour outside the boarding gate before being told to go home and come back tomorrow at 10am. We paid our own hotel and meals as well as other items as our bags were on the airplane. The next day we showed up as instructed and the airline personnel were nowhere to be seen. The counter for Air Maroc was empty but everyone showed up as instructed. Roughly around 11 am they showed up and at 3pm we were in the air. On the way back home for this 7 hour flight, they separated my wife and I where she was on one end of the aircraft and I was on the other.

"We originally booked a direct flight from Marrakech to Munich and a week before flying we just checked out of curiosity if the flight times have changed.Thankfully we did, because we could not access our booking and kept on getting a flight cancelled message. We did not even get an email about the cancellation. It took three phone calls before we got the flight sorted and had to get a flight a day earlier as the new option will require us to spend a night in Casablanca to catch the connecting flight. We still had to fly through Casablanca instead of flying direct and to make things worse the only flight offered was a 6AM flight to Casabalanca.

"We booked a flight, as a whole, from Brussels to Nairobi. We payed for it and we got the tickets. There it stated we had a stopover at Casablanca (1hour and 10 minutes lay over). Not a problem for us. When we tried to check in online, the evening before, we could only check in from Brussels to Casablanca. No changes in flight hours where shown. When arriving in Brussels, Zaventem airport, 3 hours in advance, they only could check us in for the flight to Casablanca (AT0839). The personel of RAM told us this was normal procedure and once we would arrive in Casablanca, we would receive our next boarding pass for the plane to Nairobi. Once arrived in Casablanca (on time, still had more than an hour to get on the other plane), the personel of RAM showed us where to obtain our other boarding passes. At this desk they suddenly told us 'Ow, that plane left more than an hour early!'. So, as our first plane was landing, the other one was already taking off! Nobody notified us, not online, no e-mail, message,... We were speechless and desperate. Together with an American couple (who also booked a direct ticket from Brussels to Nairobi), the personel told us it was no problem, they would refund our flight and that we would have to take the next flight, 2 days later! This was not an option for us, because we already booked a safari with driver and airport pick up (1500 dollar) and a hotel (50USD), all planned from the moment we would arrive in Nairobi. After 3 hours, they told us to come fast, because there was a flight to Cameroon we should be on. Then, from Cameroon, we would have to take a flight to Nairobi. Instead of arriving at 2am, we would arrive at 8 pm (losing an entire day of safari and hotel, but still less worse than losing 2). They told us it was safe to transfer at Douala. Once arrived in Douala (after a terrible night flight with stopover in Yaoundé), at 4am, the border control would not let us enter (because we had no ticket and visum), they called the police, who took our pasports and we had to sleep outside the police departement at the airport! At 8am the office of Kenya Airways opened (where we had to check in for the nex flight). But RAM had put us 2 on wrong seats! The others could board, but not the two of us... After 2 hoffiric hours, at the office of Kenya Airways, their personel managed to get us on a flight to Nairobi (not the RAM personel, who couldn't be contacted and where nowhere to be found...). Late in the evening we arrived in Nairobi, lost the money of our hotel, lost the money of our safari (our safari crew left at 8 in the morning...). We had to book it al again, terrible feeling! Completely ruined our holiday! This was our pre-honey moon! We only have 2 weeks of holiday each year and our start was completely ruined! The return flight from Nairobi to Paris (AT0262 and AT0760) was a disaster as well!  In Nairobi, the personel told us we would have to take our luggage in Casablanca (since we would spend one day at a hotel in Casablanca). In Casablance they told us they could not obtain our luggage. We had no spare clothes, toothbrush, shampoo... nothing! Our engagement rings where in those bags! Next day, arriving in Paris, one of our bags was missing.  After 2 hours of waiting, they found our bag, who was shipped in another plane. We panicked, because all our valuables where in that bag! At the RAM offices they told us we would be refunded and we must make a claim online.

"We were traveling from Madrid to Nairobi with a layover in Casablanca. Less than 24h before the flight I get a mail informing that the flight from Casablanca to Nairobi would be 1h before the scheduled. I was not worried as we had a 4h layover but even so, change the flight in such a short time is crazy. When in Casablanca we got into the plane at around 3pm (we were supposed to flight at 3:50pm) and everything seemed ok. Then we waited, and waited... And waited a bit longer. We were stuck inside the plane for 6 hours, the plane did not move and the staff was very rude. They told us it was a techincal problem. Then the nairobi airport was closed between 2am and 5am so we could not take off because there was no place to land (although the flight was originally scheduled to land at 2:25am and the return flight to take off from Nairobi at 4:45am). Then the crew needed to be replaced because they were there for too many hours, but no one knew anything about the whereabouts of the new crew. We got off the plane for one and half hour, put in a room with no exits, controlled by the police and with no answers. After more than 7 hours (let me remind the 6 of those were inside the airplane) we finally took off. In the meantine one of the stewards (male) pushed one passengers (female) who was trying to get some answers. The guy didn't hit the woman because another passenger stood in the way.

Also, the toilets are very dirty and stink!

So let me tell you: if you have already booked the flight, pray to God that it goes well. If you are thinking about booking it, think again! It's worth to pay a bit more and dont have you holidays ruined.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManuelP3963,Manuel P wrote a review Aug 2017,Manuel P,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",5 contributions,1 helpful vote,Madrid - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r515833653-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Worst flight ever,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Another big disappointment flying this airline. Yet it has so much potential as their cabin crew work hard, very pleasant and customer orientated.

I think RAM needs to replace their seating and entertainment system and make it more appealing to passengers as the selection on the entertainment side is a bit limited as well. The seats are not very comfortable despite being in business class.

Their boarding procedures sucks big time!! this is the best it could be described.
their business lounge in Casablanca could also do with an upgrade.

They refused abruptly with not one inch of emotion just copy-pasting ""we regretfully inform you that we will apply ticket conditions. No refund. We thank you for your understanding."" I understand they need to have policies in place but when someone is sick surely they can make an exception. I found them to be rude, cold hearted . I will never use them ever again.

"RAM and TunisAir are both geared up for the W Africa (Francophone) to Europe routes, connecting in Casa and Tunis. Both offer bargain-basement 1-way as well as rt tix. I recently went OUA-FRA on TunA and returned FRA-BKO on RAM. Their system is overnight roundtrips to W African capitals and back, easily connecting with daytime flights to/from Europe. Both airlines are much cheaper than European airlines, which only go nonstop to Paris, Brussels, or Lisbon from most W African countries, so for most destinations one still has to make a connection. My flights on RAM and TunA were uneventful. The minor delays (up to 1 hour) did not inconvenience me. Food was edible. No entertainment system (not a problem). My bag (containing no valuables) arrived on time. The majority of the passengers on RAM were West Africans making connections. There was more of a demographic mix on TunA. RAM has been struggling financially and other posters speak of lost/delayed luggage, a problem I thought RAM would have solved by now. There was some disorganization at RAM check-in in FRA, and Casa airport is a bit of a mess while it is being rebuilt. Overall, I recommend TunA over RAM for cheap flights between Europe and W Africa. It was much easier to monitor TunA flight arr/dep data than RAM, which I did for a couple weeks before each flight (TunA did pretty well). BTW, Air Algerie is also a competitor on these routes, but I avoid it because its safety record (never mind customer satisfaction) is shaky.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morphophonosyntax,Jeff wrote a review Aug 2017,Jeff,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",19 contributions,27 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Bamako,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r510595026-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,RAM as an option on flights between W Africa and (mainly) Europe,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I found an awesome deal to fly from New York to Casablanca, then Casablanca to Lisbon, then Lisbon back to New York with a pit stop in Casablanca on return. The deal was $365 RT to fly mid June, so I hopped on it.  I read the reviews prior to booking and was mortified, but decided to take the risk. I was mainly concerned about lost luggage or cancelled flights. I arrived at JFK and there was a very short check in line.  I checked in, and was told we would receive dinner at the gate.  I said ""You mean a snack?"" No no, to break fast during Ramadan, each passenger received a box with a sandwich, drink, smoothie, cookie and date as they boarded. (Our flight departed at 9 pm).  The flight attendants were amicable, the aircraft was large, spacious and comfortable.  The usual onboard entertainment was functional.  The crew served dinner which was good. The breakfast was what is served on shorter flights (bread and cheese). That could be better. Our luggage arrived with no problem for each leg of our trip. (Although when I arrived in Morocco there was a dent in the corner of one, but I was just happy it  made it, and with everything in tact.) NegativesThe return flight to JFK was not only delayed, but they did a poor job notifying passengers of the gate change.  I did not like the fact that we had to take a shuttle from the departure gate all the way across the airport (but maybe that is not an airline issue). Lastly, on our way across the airport there were several luggages on the tarmac that had fallen off a vehicle.  There was no one making any swift attempt to gather them and unite them with the correct plane.  Those flaws brought my review down from excellent to very good.  I am still glad I took the risk and booked Royal Air Maroc.  Unfortunately I have not traveled on this airline multiple times to see consistency with service, but I sure hope my experience is an example of improvements to come.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kee146,kee146 wrote a review Aug 2017,kee146,,125 contributions,59 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r508379204-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Blessed to have had a very good experience,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I arrived very early in the morning in Casablanca and went to the Domestic terminal . I had a very long wait and while I was there I met some persons who were on an earlier flight. I tried to get on to that flight but there was no room. I kept checking every time a flight was called.

About one hour and a half before the time the flight was supposed to leave I moved closer to the boarding gates.

I did not see any agents until about close to the time the flight was supposed to have left and I never heard the flight announced. When I approached an agent he said "" Oh you are the last to be boarded- and Boarded me in the system and told me to stand at the gate for transport to take me to the plane and then not long after - deboarded me after which I had a very long ordeal- I had to pass through immigration, customs, go to the RAM agent to re-book where I was told that all flights on the next day were over-booked. I was refunded any money and had to go to take a taxi to a hotel and take a train the next day to Marrakech and then a taxi from my hotel in Marrakech to retrieve my luggage and back to the hotel..

As if that was not enough on my return trip to Casablanca, my e-ticket had my flight at 12.40 pm when I eventually reached up to the counter- the ticketing clerk almost got a fit- while my e-ticket had me leaving at 12.40 pm - the system had me leaving at 10.00 am - There were two if us like that- another person was in the system as leaving 7.00 am against an e-ticket of 12.40 pm.

I had to pay 100 US to get on the 12.40 pm flight and then there was some discrepancy since the changes were not reflected in the system and there was some difficulties in obtaining the boarding pass ( the same thing happened to the other person). Evntually I barely made it to board the flight to Casablanca.

"Pluses:
It's a budget airline. unbeatable price.
It was a cheap way to get to South America and they include a hotel in Casablanca for overnight layovers
- the food on the flight was pretty good.
- the staff were ok, mostly friendly.
-I had no issues with luggage. they check it in for you when you transfer at Casablanca.

Minuses:
They were delayed by three hours on the way back and didn't notify us, and it meant we missed our connection (which left 20 minutes before we arrived and didn't wait for us).
-They are terrible at communicating. I only found out about my hotel because I rang up worried about where I was going to stay. I also only found out about the delay when I checked in and there was no explanation.
-There is NO entertainment on flights.
- Most staff in Casablanca don't speak English (they speak French and Arabic) and are extremely rude, unprofessional and unhelpful, and quite possibly racist and sexist. I had no problems on the way out but the group I was with was treated appallingly on the way back.
- we arrived back in London a day late. I'd rather pay less, but if you're dates are fixed don't take the risk.

"on 7/1/2017 myself and 4 friends flew air maroc for the first time to Lagos Nigeria. We were to arrive in Nigeria on 7/2 at 3:05am. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 3:55am we landed in which we all thought was Nigeria, but as passengers started for their luggage the crew told us to stay seated. I looked at my phone to let our host know that we just landed in Nigeria safely. To be greeted with welcome to the Cameroons and the rates for using the local cellphone service. I thought nothing of that welcome message at the time but after sitting for additional hour with no information being relayed, I began to get worried. I tried looking out of the window to see, I don't know what, only to see we were in an area with no lights, no control towers, no runway lights.it was pitch black! Now my mind was now getting the best of me thinking perhaps the plane was under siege.
Finally other passengers began to demand to know where we were, but with an inaudible PA system and the person speaking so fast in Arabic when most on the plane spoke English, I got the impression they didn't want us to know what was going. after the objection of many of the passengers on comes a Soccer Team????
It appears that this flight made an unscheduled stop that made us 3.5hr late to our final destination Lagos to pick up the Soccer Team. ;-( .

What an ordeal! The flight attendants were not that pleasant.  The personal TV monitors were not working. 2 hours into the trip we finally land, only to be told we were not in Nigeria.  We questioned them several times regarding our whereabouts. They would not give us an answer.  I fell asleep and woke to find a woman yelling, demanding they tell us where we are.

"My husband and I flew from CMN to JFK on our second leg journey from Porto. We are very happy with the B787 equipment and the flights was only three quarter full... a surprise given that it is the high season for transatlantic route. The customer amenities are all adequate if not remarkable. Have read many negative review on tripadvisor and elsewhere, we were pretty happy with the hard product. What ruined the trip was the cabin crew. RAM's crew training seems to value efficiency over basic sensitivity and civility. Never had we been waken up from our sleep and to hand over a tray of food. The restrooms are among some of the dirtiest I have seen toward the second half of the flight. But most seriously insult was the way my husband was treated prior to landing. All airlines and regulations asked passengers to stow away the trays and put their seat back up. Having sat on the emergency row, we had the fold away screen that must be stowed away for landing. Instead of asking us to put it away like anyone in the service industry will do, the flight attendant slammed it down and almost injured us. These monitor units are heavy and could easy cause serious injuries to small children. She was unapologetic and simply walked away.  Never had we been treated so rudely. I don't expect a warm smile nowaday on any airline but this is a very serious insult to their customers.  Yes, RAM offers attractive deal and fantastic aircraft. But if they wish to excel and attractive repeating customers, they need to put the customer first.

"We were supposed to fly to agadir from Gatwick by Thompson, however the traffic (as usual!) Got in the way and ruined it, so we missed our flight. We had no choice but to go on lastminute.com, and we found a great deal by RAM with two stops. Looking at the reviews, I thought that the customer service and the punctuality was going to be bad.
The plane arrived 1 hour late, and boarded late too. They made sure to apologize as much as possible for the delay. We were flying a Boeing 737-800 with a fully booked flight. Upon arrival on the plane, there were Moroccan tunes playing, and the overall design of the plane was to my liking, and the staff were always with smiles on their faces. The cleanliness of the plane would've made a fussy person cringe, but I am not that fussy and found the cleanliness average. This was economy class, so I wasn't expecting total luxury. It was a 2hr50 min flight, but it went by really quickly because they served food really quickly. The food was really tasty: there was a block of smoked salmon, cream cheese with bread, yoghurt and for the main, rice with chicken or beef. I chose chicken which was really good, however my mum chose beef, and it was extremely tasty. It's perfectly spicy, and I finished it all straight away.
The only reason why I didn't add in that star is because of the punctuality and the heat and stuffiness inside the plane. Other than that, it is cheap and I would recommend it if you aren't too fussy!!",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emanuelabille,Emanuela Bille wrote a review Jul 2017,Emanuela Bille,"London, United Kingdom",109 contributions,45 helpful votes,London - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r503402058-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Unexpected last minute flight with a good outcome ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My flight was from Barcelona to São Paulo (Brasil) with a 20 hours stopover at Casablanca. I was very afraid with the possibility to stay 20 hours at the airport, but when i arrived at Casablanca everybody was very kind to give me the support to find the company office, when i arrived at the office the employer of Royal Air Maroc gave me in 10 minutes a voucher to the hotel, transfer and the meals. I got the transfer to a nice hotel near the airport, got 3 meals voucher and the voucher to get the transfer back to the airport. The flight back from Casablanca to São Paulo was a very great experience too, we had 3 delicious meals, a lot of options of entertainment. And one more positive point is that my bags witch came direct by Barcelona, arrived in São Paulo all in perfect conditions. I had a great experience and would recommend it to others.

"Do not even consider giving this joke of an airline your business.

They pulled forward an international flight from New York to Casablanca by 1.5 hours WITHIN 24 hours of the departure time. I received an EMAIL notice of this change and we almost missed this flight as we were flying into JFK from LAX the very same day (albeit not on a RAM flight). We were schedule to depart JFK at 2230 and they simply changed the departure time to 2100.

Logistics aside, their call center staff are the rudest, most combative service people I have ever spoken to. Absolutely no empathy or desire to service the customer.

I have a strong suspicion the case is still sitting untagged at Gatwick, but do you think I can get hold of anyone to have a look for it?

Royal Air Maroc could not be more unhelpful or hard to contact if they actually tried, or cared. This attitude translates through their whole service chain from check in to cabin crew.

Everything else was terrible. We had more than 6 hours delay to leave JFK and we didn't hear a single word of apology. During the endless wait in the plane we got close to no information and no help whatsoever from the crew, who obviously thought it was better to chat together at the back rather than distributing water or food to starving passengers.

"My flight was cancelled at roughly 48 hours notice. There was an offer to reschedule my flight for later in the week but was useless as I had to be in the UK before their offered replacement. I managed to book a flight with another airline. I e-mailed saying I expected a full refund. I then received a phone call that was poorly connected and I couldn't understand what was being said. I told RAM I wanted a refund as I had made other plans. The man hung up and I received an e-mail with a re organised flight, different to the one offered in the original e-mail, that still proved useless for my travel needs. I replied again to that e-mail stating I wanted a refund and I would pursue the matter further if this was not met.
I am waiting for a response. My advice would be do NOT use this airline.

"I booked these flights because they were incredibly cheap, and then I read reviews that made me wonder if I'd made a mistake -- but, my experience was overwhelmingly pleasant.
Gate agents were helpful and courteous, seats were comfortable, great in flight entertainment, blankets, pillow, eye masks, socks and headphones were provided free of charge, food and drink offered multiple times each of the flights (even the 1hour from Casablanca to Lisbon).
The food was just ok. The dinner entrees I ordered were both beef, I declined to try the fish. One was a beef with potatoes and vegetables and cous cous on the side. The other was a beef curry with vegetables and lentils on the side. Those, while I imagine not everyone would love, were fine and edible. I would say, don't board the flight hungry, but you'll probably find something you can eat on the flight. Plenty of drinks (soda, coffee, water,) so you won't get thirsty - which is always a thing for me when flying.

Flying roundtrip from JFK to Lisbon, and there was a layover in Casablanca each way - it's the Moroccan airline, everything starts or ends in Morocco. In each of the layovers, we went to the Royal Air Maroc desk and were given vouchers for food (for layovers over 4 hours) and for food and lodging (for layovers over 8 hours).

Checked my luggage on the way back, and my luggage was not lost - which is one of my biggest flying fears.

The language barrier issues mentioned in other reviews are real, the translations from French to Arabic to English were not always perfect on board the flight. But, seriously, what do we expect? We're flying outside of the country, we're not entitled to have 100% of the staff fluent in our language just because we can't speak anything else. The gate agents in all locations spoke English, and when I encountered someone who was struggling to help me because of language, there was always someone close by who could help.

Many of the issues mentioned in other reviews were actually not the fault of RAM -- long customs lines, ridiculous rules about what is allowed on flights from Morocco to the U.S (thanks, Trump), but things outside of their control, just keep that in mind.

"My flight was an overnight flight from Montreal to Morocco. This was the best service I have ever had. A little extra legroom. Eye masks and slippers were distributed (no charge) as were blankets and pillows.  Access to movies and music were also at no charge.  The dinner and breakfast were served and food was plentiful. The bar was at no charge. What other airline does this these days? Service was excellent. The bonus was no flying through Europe, no layovers and no going through US customs.

"I will not fly again on RAM. 1st our flight was delayed because of break problems, when we fianlly got in, we stayed at the gate for 3 hrs. At 4 am, the pilot attempt to take of, sudden break and we returned to the gate. Orders to evacuate the planes were given in arabic only. we were sent to a hotel nearby and the flight was delayed by 24 hours. we left the next day, late again.Missed the connection in Casablanca. nobody to direct us for a re-routing. finally took our connection 12 hours later. Lost overall 2 days in airports.
this is not the end. when we returned, our plane tickets were voided because when the reissued our tickets in Montreal, they did not reissued the returned tickets. we were left by ourselves to fogure how to get new tickets on the way back, after 4 hours back and forth discussions and buying a business class tickets we were able to return to Montreal,
I will never fly again with RAM. Customer service is terrible. No consideration for customers. Awful and stressful.
I filled out a claimed, they offered me ''miles'' on RAM as a compensation !!!!
No way I will fly again on RAM.

"This airline was picked for our Europe package as the cheapest we could find.   I did visit their website to try to gain some knowledge and found it to be somewhat informative, but lacking in other areas.    As a group of 4 traveling together, we had hoped to sit with each other but were unable to pick our seats at any time.   Even checking in 24 hours in advance, we were told our seats would be assigned when we arrived at the airport.   This turned out to be untrue, as our seats were already assigned, and we were next to each other.  Not sure why their software would not allow better for this.Boarding was delayed, as we traveled the same day of an attack in London, so security was extra, but things did move quickly.The plane has 3 rows of 3 seats each with their own personal entertainment system and USB charging ports (some of those ports did not work though).  Our flight departed at 10PM, and within an hour after departure, we were presented with a hot meal.   It was a very good variety of items, and the hot food was HOT, and cold items cold.    A good variety of in-flight entertainment, movies, tv shows or music and even some games.   They do present you with a blanket and a mask for sleeping if you desire.  There is also a pair of socks in the bag - I suggest using them... as I believe they are made for long flights.     About an hour before arrival to Morocco, we were presented with yet another meal, again hot & cold items, very tasty.    For drinks, they offer you soda, coffee, tea, but also have available beer and wine, apparently at no charge, although not advertised.restrooms were abundant, and cleaned during the  flight.Our return flight had much of the same fare with regards to the food and entertainment.Surprisingly, their counter was open well in advance of check-in time, allowing us to rid ourselves of our checked bags.    AMAZINGLY, they allow each passenger TWO checked bags with no charge.    Very nice for overseas trips,    They were friendly and helpful at the counter.Area for improvement - communication.    The on-board announcements are I believe in 3 languages.. arabic, french, and english, however when they talk for 2 minutes in arabic, and only 10 seconds in english, you have to feel something is missed.   It was also hard to understand many announcements due to the accent.My suggestion for improvement would be to have the announcements appearing in text on the screens at each chair.The servers while at your chair are friendly, but if you want more than the provided beverage, you either get it yourself, or you have to call them, possibly more than once.   They do not make a second pass for beverage service... they are served only when meals are presented.I would use this airline again, as the items of concern are (to me) not major ones.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeGoTravels,Joseph Elster wrote a review Jun 2017,Joseph Elster,"Rogers, Arkansas",534 contributions,201 helpful votes,New York City - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r496658677-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,a pleasant surprise... a little room for improvement,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overall, a very bad experience. Prior to trip, husband received several phone calls notifying us that they changed our itinerary. He called back and requested to keep our initial departure/arrival times. Customer service reportedly made the change, but when we were getting ready to return to JFK, we learned that we were not on the initial flight back after all. A supervisor re-booked us, but she declined to allow us to sit together.

I spoke with several other travelers. Some had a good experience overall but most were disappointed (poor service, flight changes, etc). Also, most not allowed to sit together on the flight back to JFk. Interestingly, there were many open seats on our flight and it would have been easy to have people sit together.

"Luggage lost on arrival in Casablance. It was difficult to find arrival service, no signs. When there, nobody to serve you. The explanation was that the sun just set (7PM), thus all employees would run off for dinner (Ramadan). When a person finally returned, we got a report filed. Our hotel for the next week in Fes. My phone number and the hotels recorded. In the following days I  called their support center every day, only French, if you ask for English, you will be transferred to the endless recording that eventually will ruin your phone bill. My hotel called each day, they spoke French. The same story always, the bag was probabely in Brussels, no definite. My wife and I needed to gradually buy replacements for almost everything. On day 5, when I asked the hotel to inform the airline that we would move to Marrakech, then they suddenly reported that the luggage was in Fes. You need to go to the airport and get it, there is NO way they will deliver. At the airport, more hassle, no key to the storage room etc.. Finally, the luggage was retrieved and my wife is happy. We have spent substantially more than Euro 1000. on emergency replacement.

"My boyfriend and I took Royal Air Maroc for a trip from Rome to NYC with a layover in Morocco. The flight we purchased had a 7 hour layover. The boarding pass that was given to us shows an entirely different flight with a 25 hour layover! We went to many different people to sort this out saying that this was not the flight that we paid for. Basically, they cancelled our booking (not our flight) and put us on the next flight to JFK the following day. When we pressed the personnel further, he said that there were 43 open seats on the flight we were supposed to be on. So we asked to put back on the flight that we originally CHOSE, BOOKED, and PAID for and they said we had to pay extra to be on that flight because it was a ""different class."" Imagine paying for a flight time and then finding out that they cancelled your booking without even notifying you thru text or email. We had to spend the night in Morocco without any prior notice and any of our stuff Bc we checked it all in. Then we got to NYC the following day and THEY LOST OUR LUGGAGE. It was just one thing after the other. I have never experienced a flight like this and will never fly Royal Air Maroc again. When waiting for our luggage, we talked to many people and found out that they had the same experience with Royal Air Maroc changing their flights without any notice. This is completely unprofessional and having to deal with our lost luggage was just the cherry on top of this experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393nancy,393nancy wrote a review Jun 2017,393nancy,"Boston, Massachusetts",19 contributions,11 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r492601797-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Cancelled our booking, lost our luggage ",Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very much satisfied with my experience on a recent RAM flight from Montreal to Moscow (with a layover in Casablanca) - wish I have read less those TA reviews that use too much black paint. Sure, individual experiences may vary and a lot probably depends on your destination. One thing is certain : RAM transatlantic flights are served by a brand new planes with comfortable seats, decent service, food and entertainment options. Not to mention two free pieces of baggage in economy class and a free hotel room for long layovers in Casablanca.

Yes, their in-flight services and food options are still below some other airlines (KLM, for example) but it is not something that would prevent me from fluying with RAM again.

What might contribute to someone's negative experience with RAM is an outdated airport in Casablanca, higher than average percentage of passengers flying with small children (that do cry sometimes during the flight) and an occasional language barrier (unless you speak Arabic or French).

Otherwise, a very good value for money, good experience on each of my flights with RAM (Casablanca to Moscow leg as well).

"I flew to Paris for 10 days on Royal Air Maroc via Casablanca.  Picked it because I'd never been to Casablanca and it was a very good deal.   Was a bit apprehensive about all the bad reviews.   First tip: MAKE SURE you get a seat as soon as seat selection is available, 48 hours before departure.  They fill up fast and you will get stuck in the middle of the middle section (like I did).  Having said that, the 787 aircraft that goes between JFK and Casablanca was very nice. Seats crammed in (but this is the way it goes, newer the plane, more crammed the seats are).  Still it wasn't bad.  The staff were nice to me, from the airport to the aircraft.  Food was good, had it several times on the trip and no food poisioning.   Flight left on time, arrived on time.    Paris/Casablanca flights on the oldest 737 i've  been in but it seemed solid and again,staff was nice, food was okay, flights were on time, no bags (checked from JFK to ORY) lost.  Orly is nicer than CDG, smaller and easier to deal with.  Flight back also was fine except for the extra hand-search of all carry-on bags, this was a pain and took a while, there is no warning as it happens at the departure gate.   YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU CANNOT BRING LAPTOPS AS CARRY ON BAGS, THEY MUST  BE CHECKED BAGGAGE.  This, of course, can hardly be held against Air Maroc as it is a USA mandate but it wasn't pleasant.  Then you had to take a bus to the aircraft, inexplicably parked at a gate at the other end of the terminal with the jetway about 8 feet from the door.  Who knows... Flight left a bit late, probably due to the search, but the flight was nice, food was good, 787 was very pleasant despite being crammed in, in-flight entertainment was very good and as a bonus will point to Mecca for those so inclined.   All in all, for the price, I considered it a good deal.  The airport in Casablanca was interesting, clearing immigration and customs is pretty standard if a bit third-world-ish but not bad.

We were bused to the tarmac. It was a very old prop plane. With one bald tyre and one semi flat tyre. They had allocated the same seats to different passengers.

"I have sent two complaints to RAM and I have not heard a thing back!  As I have been very dissatisfied with this substandard airline, I have therefore posted it here - and will post on other sites to warn people of my experiences.Our journey out of Doha was fine and there were no issues;once we got onto the aircraft we both slept most of the way.The return journey from Casablanca to Doha was however a little different and rather disappointing. To begin, the aircraft was dirty and the staff were very inattentive.  I pressed my call button a number of times; staff did not come and were just sat around at the back.  Nor did they attend to other passengers who also had their call lights on.  Because of this, I got up and went to the back of the aircraft myself where I found staff just sitting around chatting and 'flirting' with one another and totally disregarded me and other customers!   Eventually a young man asked me what I wanted and I requested a glass of white and red wine.  He immediately dismissed me and said he would have to check at the front of the aircraft and would bring the wine to me!  I waited... a very long time.  Probably about 45 minutes!   In the end, I went back to the rear and asked again - I chose the only steward who had been polite so far throughout the journey (who was the most accommodating on the flight) he asked me what I would like.  I replied that I would like two glasses of wine: one for myself and one for my husband.  He grudgingly said he would bring it to me in cups!  To add insult to injury, after getting off the plane, my husband found a small reddish beetle type creature crawling up the outside of his trouser leg!  He promptly killed it but on further checking - it was a bed bug! This had clearly come from the plane - it could not have been picked up anywhere else!Because of our two experiences and the lack of response from RAM regarding my complaints, we shall not be using them again!

"This was an economy flight we got through TravelZoo. The airline was THE WORST!!

In Morocco we were held in 2 lines, men and women separately. Women were taken into a curtained cubicle and patted down, especially rubbing and feeling our breasts.

The lines and lack of staff made getting onboard a 2-3 hour ordeal.

They seem to hire 1-3 people to do all the desk work, and then the very same people are taking the tickets.

I was required to check my kindle. The pick up at JFK was crazy. We waited for close to an hour.

Another crazy thing is that it is now 3:00 am and our flight leaves at 10:00 am. What do you do when exhausted for 7 hours?

Next time I will spend the extra money and fly directly to Italy.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785debbiem,Debbie M wrote a review May 2017,Debbie M,,2 contributions,,Rome - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r485815051-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Don't fly Royal Air Moroc,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was really nervous to fly RAM after reading a lot of mixed reviews. I was afraid the food would be awful, the bathrooms would be disgusting, and they would lose my luggage. The food on my way there was decent -- fish in a curry sauce. The food on the way back was not great. I'm a pescetarian, so I could have eaten fish, but they ran out before they got to me, so beef was the only option. I ate some of the ""sides,"" but they weren't great. I tried to avoid using the bathrooms, but on a 8+ hour flight, that's hard. They were average airplane bathrooms! And they did not lose my luggage. Movies on board were good and some were very new, so I was pleasantly surprised.

"This is a new service from manchester and i booked in the second week via lastminute.com, return tickets were £130 incl check in luggage.  We could not reserve our seats online and had boarding cards issued at check in.Have flown via easyjet (Gatwick) and Ryanair (Stanstead) but was pleasantly surprised by RAM flight.  The plane is quite large, Boeing 737 but a little dated.Going to Casa flight was 20% occupied.  Leg room in economy was good, plane was clean (unlike ryanair !) and food was served about 35-40 mins after take off.  Food was ok, beef or chicken dish with soft drinks.  Tea was also served.  Staff friendly and welcoming.  Seats were leather and comfortable.  Not much in way of in flight entertainment, some do have RAM app which you can download and then watch in flight movies, others dont, so bring something along for the journey.Change over at Casa was painless, in flight instructions are provided for transit passengers, and airport has easy to follow signs.  Was a little bit worried as it said we had to change terminals to get our connecting flight, but this was v.straight forward.  We landed, went into the terminal and through security in around 5 mins and down some steps and into a waiting area.  This had wifi, but was quite crowded.  We waited for about 35 mins and then queued to board.  Agadir flight was on the same type of plane but was full.Return journey was early (7 O'clock) and around 4 hour wait in Casa, luckily the wait is in main terminal which has charging areas for gadgets and wifi.  Connecting flight was on time and food was better on way back, fish/beef options.

"I was very worried about flying with this airline after reading all of the negative reviews.  I wouldn't have booked with them on my own, but this was the carrier that was part of a very affordable tour package, so I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.The aircraft was a newer Dreamliner.  The seats were just ok as far as overall comfort.  The seat back entertainment system worked well on both flights and had enough content to keep me occupied.  The flight attendants hand out amenity kits with socks and an eye mask at the beginning of the flight.  Food wasn't that great, but they did make sure to hand out special meals first (I had requested the seafood option). They could have done better as far as offering water mid-flight, but it was available upon request.  The bathrooms were clean (I noticed a flight attendant servicing one mid-flight).  As far as luggage goes, they seemed ok with carry-on luggage that was reasonable.  For size reference, my husband and I were able to fly with the ebags TLS mother load mini with no problem, at or just slightly above the 10 kg weight limit.  I also carried a small handbag.  On the way back we checked one of the bags (too many souvenirs) and it arrived at baggage claim in a timely manner and unscathed.I would fly with them again on direct flights into Casablanca, but would be hesitant to make connections with them due to other reviews (as this seems to be were the problems come in).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1travlgirl,1travlgirl wrote a review May 2017,1travlgirl,"Chicago, Illinois",229 contributions,58 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r482001016-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,No problems,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"NYC-Casablanca-Madrid-Casablanca-NYC in April.       1) I was shocked how naturally, without thinking, their staff serve men first and then they might notice you if you are a woman, or they might not. I never had that experience before and this is one of the things they made me feel disgust about.       2) it's also shocking how DIRTY their planes were on Casablanca-Madrid rout and back. It's not just crumbs on your seat and sugar powder on the table, it's a years-old dark dirt on plastic panels above your head, on those fans that you are supposed to touch to turn on.       3) It's awful how unhelpful their Madrid desk was. On April 23, while every other airline had its kiosk open, RAM had a sign ""will be back in 5 min"". I waited for TWO HOURS - from 9:15am to about 11:30am. I had an 18 hours layover in Casablanca and was trying to find out if there is a business lounge at the airport, if the airline provides shuttle to the city, how safe is it to take a cab in the middle of the night, etc. I also tried to upgrade to business class and wasn;t even given a price - there were seats in business class available, but the person was unable to even figure out the price. I was offering to pay and they couldn't take the money. How more absurd can it get? NO was her answer to my every question. She then got really irritated and lectured me saying that they are ""not obliged to know about any airports"". Casablanca is their major hub. They MUST know and they MUST tell. They should have flyers with basic info on them, they should have it on their website, they should make their passengers feel comfortable, not concerned and stressed out! At 4pm, that person't shift was over and I talked to her colleague who just came in. I had the same exact experience with this other person. Are they trained that way?      4)There was a lot of nonsense - can't you people give headphones simultaneously to passengers on both sides of the plane? How come left side gets them 30 min before the right side?Why do you take headphones back more than more than 90 min before landing?!      5)Why does it take almost two hours to get luggage in JFK? and no, mine wasn't lost, it's just how long did it take for the airline to take most luggage on the transporter.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/342anno,ann o wrote a review Apr 2017,ann o,"New York City, New York",69 contributions,55 helpful votes,New York City - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r480034302-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"A lot of nonsense, dirty planes, unfriendly, unhelpful staff",Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have had the WORST!!! experience dealing with this airline at Casablanca airport, having missed my bag check in time by 10 minutes I was told that they won't accept my luggage on my flight but ""I can leave my luggage or buy a new ticket for another flight. (No other option was offered but to pay more money.) Having spoken with the 'supervisor' at check-in desk 24 today she told me the same thing, when I was pleading with her to help me she then refused to acknowledge my existence as if I was a beggar and she was then trying to speak with other passengers whilst I'm standing at the desk trying to talk to her, when I asked for her name to put into my complaint she refused to give it to me. As a paying customer I have never dealt with with such rude unhelpful people in my life they showed no compassion or understanding. I was sent to buy a new ticket and the gentleman said your checked in go and talk with the supervisor about getting your bag on the flight which leads me to believe that the woman I dealt with refused to accept my baggage because she felt like it!!! I was then told to go back to the check in desk to get my online check in cancelled which they then told me they couldn't do as they have just started to board and I was sent back to the agency office, during this time I witnessed a female royal air Maroc staff member shouting at another colleague she then approached me shouting and waving her hand in my face in an aggressive manner asking me 'what flight am getting' which quite frankly was unnecessary i didn't understand why she approached me and I had to ask her to remove her hand away from my face....so having waited 40 minutes to change my flight to the one after I was then informed that I can't get the next flight as its too late now!!! I'm stuck at Casablanca airport till tomorrow morning all because of your staff and their unwillingness to help me find a solution, I offered to pay to put my bag on the next flight and tried to explain I wouldn't mind a delay in my bag reaching gatwick. Nobody cared to listen and I felt this airline just wanted my money they don't understand what customer service is.
My advice to you Royal Air Maroc is that if you want to accommodate international travelers then you need to train your staff so they know how to talk to international travelers and so that they have an understanding of what going the extra mile is all about that's how you will keep your customers. On every review site you have bad reviews because of the attitude of your staff and their unwillingness to help and it seems you don't want to change that or you can't be bothered which one is it? I will go with the latter....I will never travel with your airline again not even if you paid me!!!! The way I have been treated today is unacceptable and has caused me a lot of distress!! Also take a look at the stale bread I was served when I flew from Gatwick the food is nothing to brag about and you should lower your prices and forget the in-flight meals I would have rather paid for edible food like I do on other budget airlines, the price is high and the service is budget with this airline.

Lost one of our bags flying from Casablanca to Agadir.  Of course this had to be the bag with all of our swimsuits we needed for our SURF holiday.

was going on vacation to morocco and read horrible reviews about this airline so was quite nervous to fly with them and packed my whole family carry ons with enough clothing to last a few days if luggage was lost.   airplane was beautiful new dreamliner   Each seat had a very big tv screen with lots of movies and a phone charger attached.   the seats were very comfortable with lots of legroom and reclined more than the older airplanes.  the legroom was more than you would get in delta economy comfort that you pay extra for.   two meals were served and all our luggage arrived without any issue.   we had the same experience on the way home  the only difference is we had to wait on long line at the gate to be patted down and all are carry on bags were searched   my son waited even longer as he was singled out and his bags and person were wanded. it took quite some time for this.  landed safely and got all our luggage again!!,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/New_Yorker_In,New_Yorker_In wrote a review Apr 2017,New_Yorker_In,new york,13 contributions,18 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r477564238-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Actually better than I expected!!!,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

﻿"It was a low cost flight and meals were decent and flight was fine. You have to ask for wine and beer if you want it for obvious reasons.

The female traveler did not like the attitude of the staff.

You need extra time at the Casablanca airport for three security checkpoint s and if you are flying to USA be CAREFUL the new rules will not let you bring any electronics other than cell phone. Be sure your cell phone will start up so they can look at it. No worries on your electronics though. They will require you to check them at 3rd security point at the boarding gate. No charge for checking them. They will give you a baggage claim ticket. Be prepared to package them up cameras tablets etc. At JFK they had secured the electronics and would only let you get them if you had your baggage claim ticket so what we thought was going to be lost was secure.

Wish we could say same for baggage. We lost one check in bag. We normally don't check baggage and travel light but decided to check our our dirty laundry and it was lost. About 10 others had same problem and to there were unclaimed bags on belts from previous flights. I expect they will fed ex our bag to our home in a few days.

If you can accept these warnings and the flight is cheap go for it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imdarkside,imdarkside wrote a review Apr 2017,imdarkside,"Fountain Inn, South Carolina",709 contributions,217 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r477264975-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,SEE WARNING,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Every time I have flown with Air Maroc, I have dreaded it.  The service and experience is predictably just not good enough/ bad.  The main benefits with Air Maroc is the price, but beyond that, while the airline quality is OK, and the generally efficiency of the flight is pretty good, the quality of the service is poor, and the quality of the facilities and food is just bad- have low expectations and you are less likely to be disapointed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/18/e1/d3/vishna.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vishna,Vishna wrote a review Apr 2017,Vishna,"London, England, United Kingdom",314 contributions,165 helpful votes,Dakar - Freetown,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r476917112-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Predictably poor service,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Do NOT rely on this airline to get around in Morocco.  Our flight from Canada to Casablanca left late and we missed our connecting flight to Marrakech, along with at least 30 other people.  No effort was made to delay the departure of the connector despite that being the only flight to Marrakech that day.  Our party of 4 was able to hire a driver, but the others were left twisting in the wind with vague promises of a bus arranged by the airline.  As we left, others were giving up and trying to find the nearby train station.  No effort was made by the airline to communicate, and every time we asked an employee, we were given different information.  An awful way to start a holiday.  Our flight home departed on time and was uneventful, but the bathrooms were like nothing I had ever seen before by the end of the flight.

"We sat on the tarmac for 75 minutes in Barcelona without any announcement about why the flight was delayed. Upon arrival in Casablanca, we were put through a second security check. The metal detectors were not working and one guard was screening all the passengers while 3 guards sat around doing nothing. Finally, everybody on the Dakar flight was bumped to the front of the line, which caused a huge commotion among the passengers that had been waiting for so long. At one point, we thought that there was going to be a physical altercation. The guards continued to do nothing. Two very kind French passengers allowed us to move to the front of the line so that we could catch our connection. We were among the last 10 on the flight.

Flight from Casablanca to Dakar was very pleasant. My wife (24 weeks pregnant) was badly dehydrated by the time we boarded the plane. The flight attendants gave her a full bottle of water. Airplane was a spacious Boeing 767 with several empty seats.

Overall, Royal Air Maroc is a decent airline with reasonable prices. Unfortunately, almost all flights are routed through the Casablanca Airport, which should be shut down for inefficiency and mismanagement. I would fly the airline again but ONLY if I could avoid Casablanca.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/67/14/5a/paul-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deutschexpat3913,Deutschexpat3913 wrote a review Apr 2017,Deutschexpat3913,"Mittenwald, Germany",201 contributions,83 helpful votes,Barcelona - Dakar,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r474898384-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Chaos,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Had to be one of the longest, most exhausting experiences flying. First off, the kiosk was not printing out my boarding pass. I had no baggage to check. And they made me wait on the line with everyone checking in luggage which took over an hour( when i literally only had 4 people in front of me). After that, we get to the boarding gate, and they make everyone step outside the area, only to wait online yet again so they can search thru every ones bags one by one. Waiting in line for another hour and a half or more. No explanation and extremely poor organization added to the time dragging on. We kept asking employees to explain, and no one could answer us.
Once we got on the plane, which was already boarding late. Bathroom line was very long, as there was only 1 bathroom on our area of the plane working, only to find out the flight attendant never checked the second bathroom until after we were all done and waited 20-30 mins in line, which was not in use, it just needed to be unlocked.
Shortage of food options, I do not eat red meat, and once they got to our row they told us they were out of chicken.

"I was VERY apprehensive about booking with RAM after reading countless scathing reviews on this and other sites.  However, I'm happy to say that we had an excellent experience with this carrier.Granted, both our outbound and return flight were slightly delayed (less than 1 hr and 1.5hrs respectively), but otherwise we had no complaints.  Ground service was organized and friendly, in-flight service was timely and pleasant.  Food, leg room, entertainment (headrest TVs) and comfort were all typical.  We were provided with eye masks, socks, blankets and headphones.Many negative reviews highlighted issues with lost/ damaged baggage, so we opted for carry-on only.  We had 45L backpacks that fit very easily in the overhead compartments.No issues with on-line check-in while in Canada, but neither on-line or kiosk check-in would work while in Morocco.

First it was delayed twice from JFK. Was supposed to leave at 8 pm then they said 10 but in reality it left at midnight. Got to Casablanca at around 9 am to connect a flight to Marrakesh which they said would not be ready until 7 pm and that they had room for my travel companion but not me!We decided it would be faster to take a taxi but they gave us a 5 hour run around to intercept our luggage before it went to Marrakesh. My travel companion was even told it was forbidden for him to cross security! We finally got a decent agent who helped us getting our luggage back but he had also added that the 7 pm flight was cancelled without us even knowing! Disgusting airline!

"On February 15 I had a flight from Casablanca to London Heathrow. Checked in my luggage and seen it even on the carts outside when boarding the plane. Upon arrival in London, my luggage was not there. It got delivered 48 hours later, in the middle of the night (3AM) to my hotel. Actually what was delivered was a small amount of my dirty laundry i had in the bag. All other items, from shoes to T-Shirts, Jackets, Pants, shirts all was missing. Even medications I could not carry in my carry-on luggage went missing! Once reported to the airline finally about 3 weeks later I received an email with the request to provide all luggage tags, paperwork and invoices which I did 24 hours later. From this point on, the airline does not respond to any correspondence, phone calls are just being interrupted by hanging off on me etc. In 27 years of traveling throughout the world, I been never treated this poorly and ignored!

But suddenly, there was a day I got an email from PayPal saying that I was refunded. Zero notifications from the company and I didnt have any IDEA about what was going on. I called the Customer Support (Maroccian number, super expensive) to listen that it was an issue with my bank account. I got embaressed at the time and just accepted. Then, I came to an obvious conclusion that it was impossible to happen as the money was already debited from my account.

"Booked a last minute flight to Madrid with less than 7 days notice.  RAM came up cheapest and had the best times that worked for my schedule.  It was not till later that I realized the horrific reviews that RAM had and wished I paid the extra, I was quite nervous!!!  Flying out from JFK to CMN basically matches other reviews of the airline.  Horrible service, flight attendants paid no attention and acted like they do not speak any English.  Inflight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants would ignore service calls.  I would have to walk to the back to request water, They would only give a little tiny cup.  When I reached CMN and connected to my MAD connection, I was surprised with the connection.  I felt the staff was trying hard to deliver good service.  They did struggle with language barrier, but were putting efforts always smiling and pleasant.  The return flights were also about the same, the staff tried hard and mostly pleasant.  Two common things about all the flights I flew with RAM was the food and lack of customer service at checkin and gates.  The food was quite horrible and limited. The food was prepared with to much salt.  Portions were tiny and not appetizing.  All flights had same boring selections, that would stink up the cabin when they started serving. The bread was always stale.  On the customer service during check in/ gate, they were rude, would not answer basic questions such as seat assignments.  At the gate finding a RAM representative was inpossible.   I did give the airline an average rating, because they did not loose my luggage, seems that with RAM it is quite common.  Hopefully this airline will get it together soon, my impression was that they are trying but not getting there. I did recently read that Qatar  Airways is possibly taking 30% stake in the Airline, hopefully they will help make improvements if that happens.  On a positive not if you do fly RAM you will get the same similar service that American Airlines delivers (if you can consider that positive).",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njchris609,njchris609 wrote a review Mar 2017,njchris609,"Long Beach Island, New Jersey",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,New York City - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r467040316-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Not Horrible not good,Date of travel: March 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On February 26, 2017, my husband, my daughter and I were traveling back to Algiers via Casablanca from Marrakech.  Our Flight #AT402 was scheduled to leave at 9:00.  When we arrived at the airport at 7:00 a.m., we were informed that the flight was delayed to fog.  This was understandable as there was considerable fog at that time.  Two hours after the scheduled departure time, we were told by a gate agent that the plane would be there in 10 minutes.  Another hour passed....no word on the flight.  When I noticed that the flight had been removed from the board above the check-in desk, I inquired as to the status of the flight to Casablanca.  The gate agent responded, ""Cancelled""....no further explanation.  When I asked what we were supposed to do, he said ""a manager is coming"".  After another long waiting period, the manager arrived and we were told that we would be going by bus for a three-hour drive to Casablanca and that the bus was waiting at Arrivals.  Also, they would put us up in a hotel in Casablanca for the night.  With no explanation as to how to get back to arrivals, we headed back the way we came into the departure terminal.  At the bottom of the steps, a gentleman stopped us and after explaining our situation to him, he brought us back upstairs to the same gate we had just come from.  My husband explained to him again what we had been told by the manager.  He spoke with several employees and led us outside to an door which eventually led to Arrivals.  Once we found the bus(es), there was much confusion again as to the procedure to follow.  Some of the buses were designated for tour groups.  We eventually boarded a bus (small van) and were driven three and a half hours to the Casablanca airport.  When we arrived at the airport, the driver just put us out at the curb with our luggage...again no explanation as to what we were supposed to do.  So, we (along with four or five other vans of passengers) headed to the entrance of the airport.  We assumed at this point that we were to rebook a flight for the next day to Casablanca.  When we arrived at the Royal Air Maroc check-in desk, there was only one person who was capable of handling the situation.  Complaints were made by several of our fellow passengers, but they were told that only one agent had the ""code"".  Eventually, another window was opened and we were able to rebook our flight for the next day and were told to go to Accommodations to receive a hotel and food voucher.  Once that was accomplished, we headed outside to look for the hotel courtesy van.  A short ride to the Relax Hotel.  We were given two rooms - one for me and my husband, and one for our daughter.

When they did not arrive by 11:00 p.m., we asked again....the desk clerk said ""you have already asked"" and just laughed.

"Flew with RAM to Brazil and back with a stopover in Casablanca.
During my stopover in Casablanca -which was essentially a whole-day which allowed me to visit the city- I was provided with a hotel which was lacking quality (including cleanliness), including bad food options. However, I do not blame RAM for this as this is a nice service they provide free of charge. One can always arrange alternative options. I did not as my arrival was late at night but would consider doing so in the future.
Planes were comfortable, especially on the long-haul flights. The state of the planes on short-haul flights was subject to improvement.
I loved the fact they offer a decent food option on the short-haul flights, free of charge. Long haul food was also good apart from the second meal (breakfast) which was basically a plain sandwich.
Baggage allowance is generous (2pcs/per person in Y for long haul flights) and bags arrived in time.
Had no hassles nor problems with this company and would recommend flying with them. I have to admit, I might be a little bit overly positive due to the bad reviews one can find here on TripAdvisors due to which I expected the worst.
Points of improvement are surely there but there are companies way worse with a better reputation here on TA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/0f/4a/7e/pietertmp.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PieterTMP,PieterTMP wrote a review Mar 2017,PieterTMP,"Overpelt, Limburg, Belgium",250 contributions,47 helpful votes,Paris - Rio de Janeiro,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r465127827-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Decent airline,Date of travel: February 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"These two flights on Royal Air Maroc were my first in many years. I flew from Beirut to Casablanca and return.
I flew economy as the difference in price between Business and Economy was too big of a difference.
The flight to Casablanca was one of the WORSE flights I had taken in my life!! The service was non-existent, the aircraft was old and in dire need of a major refurbishment and the on board food was mediocre!

"Bought two tickets from JFK - Milan with an overnight layover in Casablanca to help combat jet lag. Tickets were extremely inexpensive ($500 RT in May). Called the reservations line to book as the online booking system wasn't working. Got berated by the agent and told that the JFK - CAS flight I wanted to book didn't exist. Rudely asked how I was going to pay for the hotel in Casablanca. Finally got the agent to give me the correct flight info. Was wary of the whole thing so booked with Expedia. Booked flights only to have both legs (outbound and return) modified with no protection even though JFK - CAS arrived into CAS after CAS - MXP flight departed. Return flight was changed and we were left with a 19 hour layover in CAS, again with no protection, and arriving back in NYC a day later than originally booked. Called Expedia who had to call RAM to get refund approval due to change in flights and inability of RAM to carry us to destination. RAM agent argued with Expedia agent and hung up on him.

"We started our flight on 22nd of December from Washington DC (USA) to London-Gatwick (UK) with a stopover in Casablanca. Although we had paid for the tickets to London-Gatwick Royal Air Maroc changed our tickets to London-Heathrow without previous notification. We arrived a little bit late in Casablanca; however my wife and I were able to get to the London-Gatwick boarding gate on time.
There, we were informed that our tickets were no longer valid to LGW and had been changed to LHR that was the beginning of the chaos situation that Royal Air Maroc led us during the Christmas time.
We took the LHR flight 2 hours later arriving in UK on 23rd December, but our baggage remained in Casablanca. From 23rd to 27th December I called the customer service phone number hundreds of times, getting always the same answer: nobody knew where my bags were.
Since nobody from the poor customer service department called me, I had to go myself to LGW airport again and deal with the handling company. Finally I was allowed to get into the LGW baggage storage area and could pick my baggage up. Neither a call nor an email from Royal Air Maroc was received during those 4 days waiting for my cases. That’s what I called a company which doesn’t care of customers.
Royal Air Maroc messed up my wife and I Christmas vacation, losing our baggage for 4 days and falling into extra expenses to bring us from LHR to LGW airport. But the story still remains and today 2/16 I haven’t received yet a call back or an email from Royal Air Maroc letting me know the status of my claim#275187 . When calling them they hold me for an eternity running my call in circles from different departments until somebody pick it up, then the same answer: ”somebody from our customer service team will contact on you”, of course nobody call or email me
Despite Royal Air Maroc covers the extra expenses generated there is nothing they can do to relieve us about all the inconveniences caused and the poor customer service assistance we received from the staff in Casablanca airport and over the phone. This was the first and most likely the last time we use Royal air Maroc to fly from USA to Europe.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveRodriguez75,DaveRodriguez75 wrote a review Feb 2017,DaveRodriguez75,"Bethesda, Maryland",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Washington DC - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r460341387-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EVER TRAVELING WITH AN AIRLINE,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Booking with Royal Air Maroc was a terrible mistake!!!!!! Extremely disappointing...

I booked a flight from Nairobi to Sao Paulo on Expedia for Monday 5th December 2016. Everything was OK up until Saturday 3rd December 2016. Expedia sent an e-mail reminder of the upcoming trip and gave an option for online check-in. I tried this but the airline website showed that online check in was not an option from Nairobi. I informed the passenger that he had to check-in at the airport instead. Come Monday morning, the date of travel, he called me saying that his ticket had been suspended. His flight was to depart at 9:30 AM. He was at the airport more than 3 hours before his flight. There was no way he was too late for check-in!!! Furthermore, the airline's system showed no reason for the suspension. At all!! So basically, they suspended his ticket with no prior notice, no reason, and no option to book him on a later flight or refund. They asked us to contact our agent, who was Expedia. Their systems, by the way, showed that all travel details were intact. Expedia also informed us that they had no ability to suspend an airline ticket that had been issued and paid for. Both our efforts (mine and Expedia's) to try and find out from the airline the reason behind the suspended ticket were futile. All they could say is that they could not tell why it was suspended (if they can't tell us, who can???)

Up until now, we have had no response/explanation from Royal Air Maroc regarding this matter. All subsequent attempts to reach them for an explanation have ended in the same manner, with them saying that they cannot tell why the ticket was suspended and that we should contact our agent (Expedia). I have tried contacting the head office via the Nairobi office as the airline staff were witnesses to the passenger's ordeal; I assumed they would be able to help somehow.

This matter remains unresolved, but I am still pushing to find out why this happened. And the icing on the cake? They say I cannot be refunded for this ticket as it's a ""lost value ticket"".

Royal Air Maroc should not be able to get away with such unexplained mishaps and really really bad customer service. Not even one person took time to explain to me the reasons behind the suspension or apologize for their lack of information/comprehension of the suspended ticket.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary_Matogo,Skyship C wrote a review Feb 2017,Skyship C,"Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya",2 contributions,4 helpful votes,Nairobi - Sao Paulo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r456354828-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,SUSPENDED TICKET!!!,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After reading the revviews here, we expected to hate our lives and lose our luggage, but frankly, RAM was nicer than the US Carriers we frequent.

There was a 30 minute delay in our departure from COO Cotonou to CMN Casablanca due to thunderstorms. Given our 90 minute connection in Casablanca shrinking to 60, and our reading of the horror show that is CMN, it was a source of anxiety.

There were perhaps 20 or 30 people in our 737 departing COO, so everyone had an entire row if they wanted one. Food service was a cheese sandwich, 2 rounds of beverages, plus coffee or tea. In-flight entertainment was strange, being mostly cartoons, so we played with iPads.

The connection in CMN involves a bus from the plane to the terminal, a small security screening of our carry-on luggage, and a passport check. There are digital boards with gate assignments (contrary to one report) We took 40 minutes in total to go through formalities and make our gate. We already have Moroccan tourist IDs, having been here two months ago, so it's possible that the registration causes some people delays. There were 5 teams for immigration doing the data entry, and queue was never more than 2 people deep.

There are no ""gate now boarding"" announcements, and a lot of the waiting room chairs are not in view of the gate -- so pay attention. Half the plane boarded before we noticed.

CMN-BCN was another nice run. Plane was about 75% full, so nobody sat in a middle seat who didn't want to be. Food was a tagine-like beef stew, lentils, roll, and one beverage service plus coffee or tea. More strange in-flight entertainment.

Our checked bags were accounted for, which was nice since we departed in a rush and had about 2,000 EUR in cash checked -- a no-no we usually avoid. They were at the carousel before we could get there.

Staff on both flights were professional and polite.

Our backpacks which were checked definitely had a rough ride -- I had a mesh side pocket torn by the machinery. My fault, really. There is a saran-wrapping machine in COO that you should definitely use. Both bags look like they took a tumble on the tarmac, as they're dirtier than we checked them. Dinged one star for the checked bag abuse. Every other bag seemed plastic-wrapped, so this is partly us just not knowing the drill.

Overall, a very pleasant surprise, and inexpensive to boot. The planes were clean and seemed in good repair (newer 737-800 models). Would use them again if presented the opportunity. They were 1/4 of the price for other options for this strange route.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeB3532,Mike B wrote a review Jan 2017,Mike B,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Cotonou - Barcelona,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r454786132-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,No trouble with RAM,Date of travel: January 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Do not do it!!!!!

This was my second time flying air maroc. I know, why would I do it again? I was flying with a friend to Sierra Leone (my homeland), and she wanted to kill two birds with one stone and take advantage of the 12 hour layover in Casablanca (which we did). We had a great time in Casablanca. My nightmare started at JFK, after asking several times, at booking, after booking, and the check in desk, for a bassinet for my infant, I did not get one. When I asked the flight attendant, she initially ignored me, when I persisted she indicated ""I can not answer that right now"". We got to Casablanca pretty smoothly. The layover hotel was okay, though we spent most of our time outside of the hotel. We headed back to the airport to board out 12am flight to FNA (Freetown National Airport). We first started getting notifications that the flight was 30 minutes delayed, then 45 minutes, then 2 hours. Passengers started asking questions, they told us the captain nor any of the flight crew had shown up. We asked how this was possible, they told us that the crew was outsourced and it was possible that they missed their flight. All passengers demanded more information, when the managers and other staff came they indicated to us they would take us to a hotel 15 minutes away and we would be flying at 7 am the next morning. The bus took us to a hotel an hour away and literally dumped us there. When we got there (at this point at around 2:30 am), the hotel staff indicated we needed vouchers and they did not have any record for us to stay in the hotel. He indicated that they would ""try to get us a room"", he was processing everyone manually, people were calling RAM on personal phones, it was a mess! At this point we made a decision to go back to the airport. It was already 3 am, and we figured how much sleep would we really get if the flight was taking off at 7 am. We got back to the airport and met up with other passengers who either decided to do the same thing or never left the airport in the first place. Customs refused to let us through, indicating there is no scheduled flight for us! After about 4 hours of various passengers demanding answers from various managers and staff, they told us our flight would be at 9 am. I must mention that during this whole ordeal, I went up to several staff members to ask them for help since i had an infant with me, I was sometimes laughed at, or staff would say ""I do not speak English"" with a smirk on their face. I was waved off and dismissed. When we boarded the flight at 9 am, they did not have any seat assignments, people sat anywhere meaning families got separated. There was no space for carry on luggage and they started stacking luggage in the bathroom (there must be some safety regulation against this). We finally got to Freetown and thank God all my bags were there. Let's call a spade a spade, many parts of North Africa have a superior complex with being fairer skinned and believe they are not even African and prefer to associate themselves with the middle east. For years, RAM has not respected their West African customers. Condescending, rude remarks, disregard and disdain. I do not blame anyone but the countries for allowing this joke of an airline to continue to run in their skies, but I also blame us the consumers who continue to use this airline when for a couple of hundred more (sometimes the same price), you can use a European Carrier and at the very least be spoken to like a human being.

"I thought this would be a reasonable airline, but I was very wrong.  All aspects of service are mediocre to poor, food in business class was barely edible.  Seats are barely better than economy, despite the long flights.  Cabin service was poor.  I would have scored the airline poorly even if I had arrived as scheduled, but air crews went on strike in the two hours I was in transit in Casablanca, and I was stuck there for five days until flights resumed.

"This review I sent directly to the company a few months ago and their course of action was non existent, I received no compensation/incentive to fly again with them, there was a lack of a meaningful apology. Here is the story:
So, I bought four flights which were from Geneva to Casablanca then Rio Brazil and the same again returning home. **18th/19th July - 13/14th August 2016**
""All flights with your company were horrible. The staff were utterly rude. From Geneva to Casablanca, when the food were being served, it was a meat dish. I am vegetarian and since I booked my flights through a travel agent I never had the option to notify I was a vegetarian. So I tried asking the air hostess if she had any alternatives for me and she just shouted back at me in arabic. So the lady sitting beside me kindly intervened and translated. Upon translating, the air hostess says to me 'you eat this or have nothing!' and she continued to serve everyone around me and ignore my calling. I couldnt believe it. I was so hungry. I tried to speak to a male host for help and he seemed to not care at all. He didnt even look the slightest bit interested to be on this flight nor speak to me. All our staff were rude and unprofessional. They looked like they hated their job. The women in my row of seats were shocked too which made the head manager of the plane come over to assess the problem. She said she would find me a salad from business class, which she did but during that time a vegetarian hot meal appeared from another staff member, so after all that they did have food for me, they just didn't want to try or bother until the fuss was made.
Next flight, from Casa to Rio, same issue with food and this time they had nothing for me and didnt care or try to find me anything and all staff ignored me completely, leaving me hungry for 9 hours. Half way through the flight I was so thirsty and asked for water and the staff member said no and told me to wait until coffee and tea had been served. So i waited 30 minutes gasping of thirst until eventually they came around with small cups of water.

When I was flying home from Rio to Casa, I was next faced with more unprofessional staff members. I pre ordered my vegetarian meal days before after learning my lesson the time before and the woman sitting beside me on the plane pre ordered one too, but when the ''same'' meals came, mine looked different to hers. She had more vegetables and a packet of crackers and bread. I had none of that, the staff member serving the food didnt bother to add those extras onto my tray. So i rang the bell as I had butter and jam but no bread or crackers to put it on, and I cant believe it but that light bell stayed on for the remainder of the flight (3 more hours)... NO ONE CAME. Staff walked past but completely ignored. I am utterly shocked.
Lastly, one particular staff member tried speaking to me a few times during the flight; he was very forward and tried to make a pass at me several times. I told him it was my birthday on the flight so I wondered if I could order some wine or champagne, his response was waving a bottle of champagne in my face but telling me I cant have it unless I meet him in a bar in Casablanca after the plane lands. Disgusting bribery. I rejected his offer of course.

"I was not impressed with service on this airline. The plane was delayed for about two hours, and airline staff did not deem it necessary to inform travelers as to why, or how long it would take before boarding and take-off. When asked, they were rude and unhelpful. This delay caused me to almost miss my connective flight - and when I asked for help with exiting the plane or getting to the terminal sooner (transfer was via bus service), the staff was again very unhelpful.

When I reached my destination, both my bags were missing. The rep at the airport told me they would be delivered to my home the next day. Three days later, they still have not arrived and I just learned that they were sent 'by mail', as the airline insists on doing things in the cheapest way possible. No call was made to inform me about this, and apparently bags will reach me almost a week after I reached my destination. If one wants to lodge a complaint, a letter has to be sent to a PO Box in Prague. Hm.

Food was terrible (but that's pretty normal with most airlines though), and I personally did not like that staff came through the cabin with food, drinks, duty free and so many other things for a huge chunk of the night flight. Some sleeping passengers were even woken up by the staff.

Overall, not a great experience.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyage476271,Śrīla D wrote a review Jan 2017,Śrīla D,,3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Montreal - Frankfurt,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r450362989-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Long delays with no communication, lost baggage, terrible food",Date of travel: January 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew coach (solo) from NYC to Marrakech and business (with adult daughter) on the return.  While the amenities and seating were obviously superior in business, I received better treatment overall in coach.   To start, an airline that gets me from Point A to Point B in one piece and without having feared for my life will earn at least a two.  With that said:  Coach:  Flight was packed with a ton of crying babies--last thing you want on a long flight, but obviously not in the airline's control.   Food was decent and service was pretty attentive.  Boarding was slow and somewhat disorganized, but not horrible.   Main issue on this flight was one member of check-in personnel.  She argued with one of the flight attendants (not sure what she was saying) then pushed by me as she departed the plane--I mean literally pushed me out of the way as she went through the aisle.  Left me with very low expectations of what was to come, but thankfully this was the worst of it.Business:  Seating is very comfortable.  As there were weather delays (we were initially rerouted to Boston), I was very happy to be in these seats.   Food was plentiful and pretty good, as were the entertainment options.   Issue here was treatment, and I'm sad to say that race definitely played a factor (I am African American).   When my daughter and I first headed toward Business, personnel on the ground said ""no, no--this way"" (i.e., we were directed towards Coach).   When we responded that we were in Business and showed him our tickets, he said ""okay"" (no apology).   When we began to climb the stairs to Business, the flight attendant said ""no--you're going the wrong way.""  The ground personnel then motioned to him that it was okay.   I am not one to attribute every bad experience to race, but this was clear.  I won't belabor the point, as I know people are dealing with much worse than being assumed not to possibly be able to afford Business, but I paid a lot for the experience and this definitely tainted it (service on board was fine but not as attentive as I'd expect in Business).  We'd also read reviews that Business passengers were taken to the plane in a separate van.  That did not happen (we were in a hot bus with everyone else).  Not sure what happened there (maybe reviews were wrong or I missed an announcement...).Overall, I commend the flight attendants on the flight to RAK (Coach) and the plane designers and chefs on the return (Business).

"The heading says it all.  Avoid.  Only reason I took this was relative price, and I've learnt a lesson not to do that. The food on the onward flight was barely eatable (Chicken / fish). On the return they had *only* beef - which we don't eat. Their response was basically ""in your face"" - don't eat then.   My regret was only packing only 1  sandwich before boarding - instead of 4.Their ground operations were a joke .. literally -  some of the security screening staff were just standing around cracking jokes with their colleagues. The check-in desk at Casa Blanca who were responsible for transiting our luggage on to Madrid messed up in front of our own eyes, and we lost a suitcase.Luckily Iberia (alliance partner to RAM) lost-luggage desk at Madrid are  way more efficient, and we got our luggage in 2 days.I give them a 3 star because they got us safely back home - there was heightened security while boarding at Cas Blanca to DC, given the recent terrorist events.

"Royal Air Maroc is the worst Airline flying into and out of Sierra Leone and Africa at large. Why? They have a terrible customer service in Freetown, Lungi, in flight and on the phone in the US and Morocco. They are corrupt and their corruption starts with the Manager at Lungi. Their agents lack the simple concept of good customer service. They lack simple communication skills. Most of their air attendance cannot speak proper English and as a result are unable to make proper announcements in flights. The transit process at Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport (CMN) is also the worse I have ever had. The agents at the airport do not communicate well, they refuse to provide passengers with accommodation and when they do, it’s a lounge at the corner of the airport that is usually over crowded, and dirty with no food or water. Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport (CMN) Airport do not even have proper internet connection for stranded passengers to communicate. When a flight is delayed or cancelled, passengers have to figure it out themselves by checking flightstates.com. Royal Air Maroc staff do not have the simple communication skill to inform passengers about their delayed flights or cancelled flights. The Manager at Lungi International Airport is corrupt and one of the staff that should not be serving people in Sierra Leone. He will pull passengers he likes or that pays him money from the back of the queue and put them in front of others. He did this to me and when I confronted him on December 27th, he threatened to not let me fly. I stood up to him anyway. He was rude to me and other passengers, unprofessional and not fit to do business in the hospitality business. This airline should be banned from flying to Sierra Leone and Africa. Air Morocco is losing and leaving behind baggage of passengers during every flight to Sierra Leone without compensation. I do not recommend this airline to anyone flying to Sierra Leone or Africa.

My story started when my December 26th, 5:30AM flight was delayed. There was no one to communicate the information to passengers. Someone came and whispered in my air that the flight is delayed and will not arrive until 1:30PM. This person told me there is a bus outside taking passengers to the Hotel. I had to announce this information to other stranded passengers. We walked out to the bus which was also unorganized. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff at Lungi Airport Hotel were incapable of handling all the passengers. They were also rude, unprofessional and not fit for purpose. They were giving rooms to people who they knew or have paid them money on the side. I spend more than 2hrs trying to get a simply room to sleep and wait. In the morning, the hotel staff tried to help us move back to the airport. They were collecting our luggage without tagging them which means, anyone can claim another person’s luggage without them knowing. I refused to let my luggage out of sight for this reason. When we arrived at Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport (CMN) Airport around 3PM, we missed our flight to New York. We spent more than 7hours trying to fight with Air Morocco staff for accommodation. Out flight to New York was scheduled for 3:30AM on December 28th. After hours of fighting with words, the finally gave me and another person accommodation at the Airport Hotel. We went to the hotel and stood there for another 3 hours just to check into the hotel. There was no hotel attendance at the desk. We finally got a room at 11PM and slept for 2hours. On our way to New York, a passenger was serious sick. We stopped at some island in the middle of the ocean to hand the sick passenger to emergency services. We were at this island for more than three hours and during this time, none of the air attendance said a word to any of the more than 200 passengers on board. We were in the dark and did not know why we landed, were we landed, when we will depart for our final destination. No food or water was served. After hours of waiting, I asked them the question, where are we and why no one is telling us the next steps. Their response was, we will depart in 15 minutes. We eventually departed in 20 minutes. On our way to the New York, the flight attendance did not offer an apology, they did not explain why we stopped, they did not inform passengers who may have missed their transit flights what the next steps will be. We sat there and finally arrived in New York at 9:45AM.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676tambal,Tamba L wrote a review Dec 2016,Tamba L,,5 contributions,8 helpful votes,Freetown - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r448142941-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Royal Air Maroc is the worst Airline flying into and out of Sierra Leone and Africa,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"RAM was completely disorganized in Accra (literally using pencil and paper to track seat assignments) to the point where we departed late and missed our connecting flight in Casablanca.

Ground staff scooped up soaking wet contents and rammed them back into suitcases. Passengers complained to ground staff manning the steps to plane and they made at least passengers wait in the rain for 10 minutes as a punishment I guess. Tried to get name of this female official and she more or less told me to **** off. Finally made it into plane, cabin crew wouldn't let remaining 10-15 passengers take on hand luggage. Passengers protested, cabin crew surly, and pilot came out of cockpit to shout at a few more passengers. Plane took off 30 mins late because of all the arguing - all completely unnecessary. RAM cabin crew couldn't care less - maybe indicative of airline as whole!",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattxxx4,mattxxx4 wrote a review Dec 2016,mattxxx4,London,37 contributions,26 helpful votes,Casablanca - Freetown,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r444842409-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,They get your there...

"Let me start by saying that Casablanca is the worst airport I've ever been in. It's pure chaos. There's no lines, just huge clumps of people. Royal Air Maroc canceled my flight to Barcelona, meaning they had to change my return flight, which caused some issues at work because the cancellation occurred a week before I was supposed to travel. As you can imagine, I didn't particularly appreciate that. They put me up in a hotel that wasn't anything special, and it was very far out of Casablanca proper, so I couldn't go visit it. My flight out of Barcelona to Casablanca and my flight from Casablanca to Montreal were also delayed for several hours. The good thing is, at the least their staff were extraordinarily lovely. I also really appreciated the complimentary socks offered on board. I always cold feet when I travel by plane, so I found that to be a clever touch.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178arianec,Ariane C wrote a review Dec 2016,Ariane C,"Ottawa, Canada",57 contributions,25 helpful votes,Montreal - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r444344821-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Delayed flights in a chaotic airport,Date of travel: March 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from Rome to Marrakech and back and no lag did impress us much. The fleet is rather old and planes are small and not always clean. Service is fair, but nothing to impress you much. Check in procedures are chaotic, to be euphemistic and boarding is a real mess with no assistance at all outside or inside the plane. Schedule is also not reliable as the planes are pretty much often late; we were delayed by one hour (not too bad but enough to mess up with your luggage if you have a connecting flight) as the incoming aircraft was stuck in Casablanca. And this is also the main reason, Casablanca. They are down to a single runway (both for landing and taking off) and they also host military planes with a lot of aircrafts going out at the same time. No wonder they are regularly delayed by one hour, to say the least.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/f1/07/bb/marco-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/398MarcoS,Marco Grava wrote a review Dec 2016,Marco Grava,"Rome, Italy",834 contributions,426 helpful votes,Rome - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r443697492-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Not my favored by any means,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I went for a vacation to Morocco this thanksgiving along with six other families. While there wasn't any issue with the vacation itself ( we enjoyed it in fact thanks to the tireless efforts put in by Youssef Ouibza and team from Key Travels- separate review), the travel from Washington DC to Casablanca and back on Royal Air Maroc left an extremely bad taste. Here are a few of the observations that will hopefully be of help to any future passengers and more importantly to RAM so they could improve their service levels.

Food
Inspite of advance vegetarian meal selection there was limited to non existent vegetarian options for main meals and snacks. On our outward (AT219 IAD to CMN on Nov 17th, 2016) the snack was basically a cup of fruit. When asked if there was anything else, the cabin crew basically said that I had an option to eat meat. Last time you checked, I did not delegate my rights to the cabin crew to decide on my dietary preference. On the return leg we were given a cheese sandwich in the same container as a turkey sandwich. It's not as though Moroccan cuisine is lacking in vegetarian options, it is a simple case of faulty meal planning by RAM.

Cabin
The rest rooms aren't clean and for some reason the the deodorizer doesn't exist or isn't working. The flight from IAD to CMN or verge return isn't as long as some of the flights to the middle east the rest rooms are something that are best avoided within a few hours of flight time. Contrast that to 14 hour non stop flights like Emirates, Etihad and Qatar. The restrooms in those airlines are a lot cleaner.

Check in experience
CMN can best be described as chaotic.The signage is pretty confusing and for an English speaker, a challenge that could possibly cause you to miss your flight.The airline itself doesn't have consistent approach to check in process. Case in point, we took a connector flight from Marrakech Menara to CMN and some of my friends had used a kiosk to check in. Of the folks who took the kiosk check route, some were waved through to boarding without an issue and one friend was told that the kiosk check in would not work. He missed his flight and was told hat he had to re book on a different flight home. This is entirely arbitrary making the impression on RAM that much more negative. Overall, RAM is best avoided if you do not want to have issues with your vacation.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lnukala,Zaphod wrote a review Nov 2016,Zaphod,"Ashburn, Virginia",6 contributions,4 helpful votes,Washington DC - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r440656865-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,My experience with Royal Air Maroc,Date of travel: November 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flying experience was good. Food was good and even above average in my opinion, nicely spiced Moroccan food when travelling outbound from Casablanca. Legroom above average. No inflight entertainement - but well, I could read a book finally.

Two instances I want to report, one very bad, the other good, as an anecdote.

1) We had spent 3 days in Morocco on our way to Congo, when checking in the lady says that our visa is valid from the 18th of October but that we were the 17th. I said yes, we arrive on the 18th at 3am so it's ok. She says no, we cannot fly, It's the date of departure that counts. (What? Can I see a text of law please?) She confirms this with the manager. We are a family with three children aged 0-2-4. Now imagine us. I ask to speak to her manager right away. My wife who is much more diplomatic and wise than me has a 30 seconds talk with the manager, who says ok you can go. .... I let you imagine the kind of mental strain such a situation can have. You cannot do this to passengers, I kept telling myself. How can you do this.

2) When disembarking, just before doors had opened, my son walked in front of business class passengers and so I followed him to be close to him. When the door opened, the chef de cabine asked me and my son to come near them, but it was a very nice and delicate way to let business class passengers disembark first, and then me and my son, which was very fair and I thought this was so so professional of him.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulLatam787,Paul wrote a review Nov 2016,Paul,"Biel, Switzerland",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Canton of Geneva - Pointe Noire,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r433797227-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Good experience,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Unfortunately, it was not the only time happens with this airline.
I had to use it for several years, having to travel to Morocco for work because there is no otyher fron Madrid to Casablanca. Never ever leaved on time, the treatment on the plane is bad, always leaves late and never apologize or respond for the delay.
And it was not differente on the trip to Rio de Janiero the delay was a full day, instead of going straight to Rio de Janiero as was the booking, we went to Sao Paulo and then Rio, so 4 hours more of delay and no one repond.

"The company CHANGED THREE TIMES the departure time over the week before the departure date, which made my itinerary impossible as the timing for connections were not matching anymore. I reached to the customer service to find me a solution, yet they were unhelpful and were even irritated I would call for such matter.

I finally found a new itinerary myself and decided to call them so that they could make the necessary changes. They answered and did it, or claimed they did. When I arrived at the airport no changes were made and thus I was faced with either missing the flight or buying AGAIN all tickets (more than EUR 500), which I did.

When back from my trip, I filled a complaint to have them reimburse the extra costs, but after 5 emails and multiple attempts to reach the relevant service I still haven't heard from them. It is a shame that a national company behaves like that. Avoid to use this company, it will change departure time without notice, planes are poorly maintained and customer service is the worse I ever encountered.

"where to start...

My initial flight at 18:10 from london heathrow to casablanca was delay by 3 hours. then my connecting flight from casablanca was delayed by 10 hours. i was stuck at casablanca airport with a 13 month old baby. i went to the transit desk and had to literally beg for at least 2 hours in a room full of people who flights were also delayed or canceled. after 2 hours was given a hotel then transport to the hotel took another hour. which was very unorganized in the end had to get a taxi to the hotel. extremely terrible experience!

on the way back from agadir my original flight at 23:30 AT0482 was delayed so we were rushed on to the 20:20 which was delayed to 21:30 lucky we were at the airport early.

our connecting flight from casablanca to london heathrow was 18 hours later at 16:30 on 25/10/16 when we went to the transit desk we were told we will not get a hotel. even though before I left England i called the airline who told me the airline will provide a hotel if the lay over was over 8 hours the airline would provide a hotel which did not happen i had to pay 980 morrocan dirham for a room which i expect compensated in full. the staff at the transit desk were very rude to say the least were not interested in anything i had to say and not willing to answer any questions either we were just told 'sorry no hotel if you have any question go ask manager' however there was no manager around as other staff had told us he wasn't in for another 3 hours. we called royal air maroc when we arrived in England and were told we should have been given a hotel for the 18 hours transit! which we were refused even after 2 hours of trying to tell the staff at the Casablanca airport that we had confirmed this before we set off from London as we didn't want any stress travelling with an infant!

I missed my transfer from airport to hotel due to delays and more 13 hours of my holiday wasted due to such a terrible airline honestly the worst holiday of my life. it was my sons first flight and holiday which turned out to be a nightmare because of royal air maroc the ""royal"" needs to be removed from their name! if you want a trouble hassle free travel AVOID ROYAL AIR MAROC",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulwK698FL,paul w wrote a review Oct 2016,paul w,,14 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r431719587-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,worst airline ever used 3 of 4 flights delayed terrible,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I found myself on the evening flight from Casablanca to Abidjan recently. Both my colleague and I were travelling business. Check in was easy and we made it through the controls without too much hassle. Then we made a beeline to the RAM lounge which was nice and peaceful.

The flight was on time. We had seats in the first row which was not a good idea as the legroom is obviously restricted by the bulkhead in front. As we settled in the pre flight non alcoholic drinks were distributed. No champagne here...

The 4 hour flight was trouble free. The meal was OK - I avoided the main course which looked horrible and focused on the cheese board.

The two cabin crew who looked after us were not very communicative. They seemed to be just going through the motions. My request for a gin tonic was met with the delivery of an empty glass and a can of tonic water. And when the young stewardess was wheeling the coffee trolley around at the end of the meal she studiously neglected to offer any of the digestifs.

But what bugged me the most was the seats. They were broad enough but failed to recline more than a few inches making sleep impossible for me. And there was absolutely no entertainment provided... Wow. Despite arriving 20 minutes ahead of schedule I deplaned in a tetchy, tired mood. It was in the middle of the night after all.

"Unfortunately we didn't have a lot of choice when booking our flights to Marrakech due to our dates of travel, so we rolled with it. Part of travelling with certain airlines is you will be required to travel from the gate to the aircraft (this wasn't an issue for us as much as people smoking next to the bus when there was jet fuel less than 10 metres away, that I found frightening).

Our plane we had to catch was late from wherever it flew from and therefore made us late getting into Casablanca, we had to transit there to catch our next place to Marrakech. When we arrived in Marrakech, it soon became apparent even though we had made the flight, our labelled (Short Transit) bags had not. Which meant we had to travel into the desert (for 3 days) with the clothes we had arrived in. Not ideal.

Our accommodation found luggage the following day whilst we were in transit and bags were kept at the airport until our return. Airline doesn't arrange to have your bags dropped off to your accommodation, you have to make your way back to airport at own expense to collect your bags. So this just added insult to injury. Two security checks to get to where bags were saw us both loose our sunglasses. Security personnel near lost bags were dodgy.

Staff on the return leg were very unhelpful on the return trip when trying to check in, they directed us to the wrong area and where we thought check-in was, actually was where it was.It was just a really disappointing experience. It would go a long way to improving customer service if they took care of getting lost luggage to your hotel or Riad rather than making customers (who may be tired from travelling) come and collect them from the airport.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8mum0f3,gr8mum0f3 wrote a review Oct 2016,gr8mum0f3,"Sydney, Australia",56 contributions,33 helpful votes,Malaga - Marrakech,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r428343049-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Lost Our Bags,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This flight has been slated by many other reviews, as has the airline. My experience is that RAM provide an efficient, pleasant and inexpensive option from Heathrow at a peak slot time.

The 737-800 was clean and comfortable, the staff were helpful and friendly from check in, boarding, on board and on the ground at Casablanca.

The inflight food was not exceptional but I had the beef and green beans option for my main which was quite acceptable as I had not paid Michelin star prices. My smoked salmon and cream cheese starter was a delicious morsel and a yoghurt dessert rounded it off nicely with coffee

The flight was only about 30% full so it would have been better to have had a soft drink refill without asking but I guessed that was company policy rather than staff indifference as the cabin crew were friendly, talkative and even joking.

I hope my internal flight in Morocco and my return journey prove as acceptable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/4c/c2/ff/john-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSA402621,John B wrote a review Oct 2016,John B,"Carmarthen, United Kingdom",677 contributions,312 helpful votes,London - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r427666473-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Efficient and Inexpensive,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight was cancelled without any prior notice, nobody informed me or the agency that reserved the ticket for me however we already provided them by email and phone number.

i called the customer service through my phone (International call while roaming) and informed the agent with all flight information where the agent said yes we didn't inform you because there is no number in the reservation done on the website.
asked for sort of compensation for what happened and the agent kept saying there is no phone number to call you so thats why we couldn't reach you.
then i asked for the other options and i had to take the flight for next day, confirmed my email address on the phone to send me the updated ticket then the agent put me on hold, the call lasted for 37 minutes and then told me that the shift is done and had to transfer the call to another agent.
call is transferred without explaining to the other agent who wasn't speaking english so didn't understand me and had to transfer the call to another agent who dropped the call.

"When we arrived in Casablanca we learned that because my passport had been stamped (in error) and my husband's had not, he was allowed to collect luggage and recheck it for our trip to Madrid. I could not collect my luggage or check in for our Madrid flight due to the custom agent's error in Fez. We were shuffled from one Royal Maroc agent after another being sent back and forth between several parts of the airport. Not one of them would cancel the stamp so we could proceed. Finally the customs people sent us to the office of the Royal Maroc Ticket Manager. After waiting in a long line the Manager addressed us condescendingly and dismissed us to an uncomfortable waiting area while she sat at her desk doing nothing.  At this point we were becoming concerned that we would be stranded in this airport and would miss our connecting flight while our luggage remained on the carousel in the baggage area. The Ticket Manager finally rudely and aggressively confronted us and offered no assistance. At this point we called a travel agent's emergency number even though they had not made this reservation.

"Check in at Barcelona airport was fast and the clerks very helpful. We flew from Barcelona airport to Casablanca. Inflight service was good and the stewards and stewardesses very pleasant. Seat were fairly comfortable.
We had an 8 and a half-hour wait in Casablanca and Royal Air Maroc provided a hotel with lunch and dinner very near the airport. That sounded wonderful.
The problem was that the airport staff at Casablanca airport made us waste 3 hours sending us from one place to another. Shere incompetence!
When we eventually got to the hotel, it was too late for lunch and dinner was served after we had to take the bus back to the airport. The hotel staff kindly offered us some food before we left.
Both flights were very punctual and we got to Dakar on time. I'd heard numerous horror stories about luggage being ""lost"", but we recovered our suitcase and rucksack fairly quicly at Dakar airport.

"I took a flight from Heathrow to Agadir, with a connection in Cassablanca.
The connecting flight was delayed by four hours. When the flight finally left it tried to land at Agadir but somehow missed the runway and dramatically climbed back into the air. There was only an announcement in Arabic, but I assumed as the screams stopped, that everything was OK. An hour later we landed. Again no announcement. As if turned out we were now in Maracech.
We were made to wait in the plane for an hour. No water, no explanantion.
The doors were opened and we were told to go through immigration. It was only that there were a few helpful Moroccan travelers on the plane, that I discovered there was a bus waiting to take us to Agadir (our original destination)
The bus waited for an hour, and then headed to Agadir....again no water, no explanation.
We were dropped about 4km outside of Agadir. Thanks again for the helpful Moroccans for explaining this to me as there was no help from the staff. After 2 expensive taxi journeys and a 5 hour trip that took 27 hours I finally arrived at my destination.
I don't usually complain about things as I just take it as its all part of the experience. But this was a near death experience, with no help from any of the staff and no provisions for the basic necessities of existence such as water.

"The worst flight I have ever ever been on. Both ways!! So much so that my kids were really dreading the return flight. If I had the money, I would not have flown with them on the return leg. Where do I start... No inflight entertainment whatsoever. Nothing at at all. Traveling with two kids. Not even a must station to listen to, no colouring books, I'm just shocked beyond words. A transatlantic flight. Surely some aviation laws were broken.
Food was not fit for human consumption- truly inedible. Every the rolls we're so burnt and hard the kids couldn't manage it with the spread. Very limited alcohol as I was three rows from the front and I asked for red wine and it was finished. Just beer left I was told. We've only just boarded the plane, did they restock at all.
Coming back was same thing but even worse as I was not verbally assaulted by their engineer who decided he needed three seats so he could get some sleep and I had to move. He even physically pushed me to get me off the seat. When I complained, the stewards just spoke in Arabic to him and yet did nothing. Only when another kind gentleman offered me a seat next to him, as I didn't want to sit where I could not see my kids , did the stewardess come to express some remorse and excuse the engineers behaviour.
If I could give 0 stars I would. I've been all over the world using every imaginable airline possible but this takes the biscuit. Never again. Never ever ever. It was just too horrible to really put into words properly.
Oh yes, they lost three pieces of luggage on the way out and I was the one chasing and going to the airport everyday to check. The bags came 5 days later. I arrived on a Saturday morning and the bags on a Wednesday.

The entertainment system was terrible .
The Crew was friendly and helpful.

I also did the return journey with RAM and again the condition of the plane left a lot to be desired.

At least the arrival and departure time is such that you would miss all the traffic jam etc....

The boarding out of Bamako was a shamble. Putting all passengers (business or not) into one single bus crammed full in the heat of the night with no air conditioning!! APPALLING!

The airplane is an old 767-300 with OK seats and reasonable service. The crew was solicit all time. The entertainment system does not work well. On the first flight the screen was broken and on the way back the travel map was not available.

"I travel a lot internationally and missed flights and lost baggage are just part of the game. When these incidents happen, you can learn a lot about an airline.  Most will show their true mettle and do everything in their power to fix the inevitable mishap; Royal Air Maroc airlines will not.  Every step of my journey I discovered a common theme: ""I cannot help you. You will have to ask someone else."" I saw this in Tunis, Casablanca, and JFK in NY from at least a dozen people so I don't think it was the case of a single disgruntled employee.  In the early morning hours on the day of my flight they mysteriously decided to delay a 1505 flight (Casablanca-JFK) until almost 2130 (I suspect they did this because they didn't have a full flight), they threw my entire itinerary off and 18 hours of travel turned into 48 to include sleeping on the floor in JFK. The highlite of the trip was when I asked for a hotel room in JFK. The agent told me that they only offer hotels if the delay is more than 8 hours.  When I informed her it was 9 hours she immediately responded with ""would you like the number for our complaints department?""  The second highlife was in Casablanca when the bus driver didnt close the door and one of the passenger's bags on wheels flew right out of the bus and onto the tarmac.  We all got a good laugh out of that one.  In any case, I think this is an airline that has decayed from within and I doubt they will be troubling us for much longer.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abulaith2016,abulaith2016 wrote a review Sep 2016,abulaith2016,Tunisia,7 contributions,,Tunis - Denver,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r420096974-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"""Sorry Sir, you will have to ask someone else.""",Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flying with Royal Air Maroc was not the best experience and it started off with almost 3 hours delay at the departure in Bissau. Sitting there waiting in the night at an airport with almost nothing to offer.
The first leg of the flight from Bissau to Casablanca was fairly ok but the breakfast they offered was quite poor. Also the tray didn't look fresh/clean.

Finally at the Casablanca AIrport I realized that I had very little time to get to the connecting flight and the security check took forever and was somewhat in chaos. I even saw one woman bypassing the security check and the police just shouted at her but she didn't stop and continued into the crowd. After changing to a shorter queue I finally made my way through the security check and made it just in time to the connecting flight to Brussels.

Also the 2nd leg of the flight was a bit delayed and this time I am happy about that since I might had missed it otherwise. Onboard they offered a meal with chicken or fish and it was quite ok. Alcoholic drinks were for free in the economy class and I had some red wine that was fairly good. No entertainment at both legs of this trip made it a bit boring but I slept a bit.

Finally when reaching the final destination it just got to accept that my checked in suitcase didn't arrive. At the moment when I write this the company has called me to inform that the suitcase has not been located yet.

"Good flight, the flight has the distinction of having two luggage compartments that is one more than most of the others flights, and a cabin baggage which is really handy when it's a long haul flight

"Overview:

Outbound Flight:

I asked for a drink, which took about half an hour to arrive and that was after asking two-three times. Cabin manager was very attentive on the outbound flight and the food was not appealing. Very small pieces of chicken were given to us and rice was bland. Desert was very chocolatey and quite sickening. The side dish wasn't nice and I had no idea what it was. Legroom was good for a 737. One thing that was quite unusual was the staff telling everyone that it was a full flight, but business class was completely empty. I asked if I could sit in business class, but was told that I couldn't because the flight was 'full'. We didn't even have a safety demonstration on either flights. The staff took a very long time serving meals and even longer collecting trays when everyone had finished, meaning that we couldn't get up or strech, due to the table tray obstructing the path.

Inbound Flight:

The inbound flight was better, although not perfect. Staff were more attentive, however the food was worse, with bland rice and dry, chewy meat. We went over our luggage allowance on one suitcase, however because all the other cases were below the maximum allowance, the check-in staff kindly let the suitcase through, with no extra cost. The TV's on the plane were not functioning properly and the quality was poor. The seats recline back a little bit and the arm rests can be pushed up to create more room. The seats seem to be quite a bit higher than the windows, which I thought was unsual for a 737.

Pros:

- Flights were on-time.

- Seats had good legroom.

Cons:

- Ignorant staff.

- Staff were untruthful about it being a 'full' flight.

- Bland food.

I expected more from this airline, especially as the Princess of Morocco owns it... The plane was also very dirty, as the turn-around was very quick from the previous flight, so prepare to have dirty tray tables and find rubbish around the cabin.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaiderA2000,H-Ali wrote a review Sep 2016,H-Ali,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",22 contributions,37 helpful votes,London - Rabat,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r414620518-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Return flight was better...,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me start by saying, HORRIBLE. I flew with bad airlines before, but Royal Air Maroc is by far the WORST. From the moment I booked my ticket I knew something was wrong, the horrible customer service, the horrible Planes, The horrible service on the plane, the Horrible HORRIBLE 18 hours layover in one of the worst airports in the world , it was all Just a mess, and at the end, after bribing and paying for my “Free Hotel Room” , and complaining about the Service from the takeoff till the final landing, I got a (60 Euros Voucher to be used within a year).. As If I will ever EVER set foot on one of those planes with this horrible airlines.

I take a 7.5 hours Flight from Montreal to Morocco , My seat was BROKEN, I talked to the flight attendant and he was like “Yeah, we have a lots of seats broken”.. and THAT was it… sitting for hours on a broken seat was SO MUCH FUN, and using the disgusting filthy bathrooms ( I have photos) was another treat, the garbage can was broken, the sink wasn’t working, there was no toilet paper in two of the washrooms, it was soo dirty it was disgusting. Second flight, Morocco to Beirut,

Well.. let's just say that the trip got WAY worse… on my way back with my brother we were assured we have a hotel for our 18 hours overnight stay.. I contacted and confirmed and Got assured twice we'll be getting hotel room the airport.. Got here.. they tell us the hotel is full and they can't do anything.. then someone behind the desk told me go to the hotel and see if they can find you a room there usually is.. i get there and the guy told me yes he can get me a room and I showed him my Royal air Maroc ticket.. he made me fill up a paper and then said i had to pay 60 Euros and then discuss a refund from Air Maroc... !!!???? I was beyond exhausted at this point.. pulled my credit card.. then he objected to paying with card saying sometimes it charges sometimes it doesn't and he prefers cash cause he's DOING ME A FAVOR ;!!!?????? i said i have no cash on me but 20$ .. he said FOR 20$ HE CAN TRY THE CREDIT CARD MACHINE !!! .. he wanted to charge me 100 Canadian i said 60 eur is 87$ Canadian!??? . I ENDED UP paying 60 Euros plus the 20$ BRIBE .. To enter a HORRIBLE DISGUSTING ROOM.. Floor was sticky, the bed sheets had big brown stain.. The pillows were disgusting and one of them was WET.. There was no tv remote.. no covers.. no tissues.. No internet .. and one shared filthy washroom with NO locks (shared with all the rooms) .. ( I have pictures of all of that)
I woke up early morning to two LOUD ladies on the reception screaming at each other.. i went to talk to them and again they said talk to royal air maroc it's not our fault !!
Then, after horrible 18 hours in that airport (Broken Seats, One charging station for all airport, AC barely working, huge lineups for the washrooms), We got on the plane, which was so old, No entertainment systems, no charging plugs, Not even magazines or newspapers, all our gadgets were dead because of lack of charging stations at the airport, we decided to just get the flight over with and couldn’t WAIT to land back home in Canada.... After our meal we click the call attendant button.. No one showed up for 20 minutes until we flagged an attendant down.. asked for white wine.. he asked his colleague (Mr. YOUNES) WHO appeared to get so annoyed by the request and gave us two bottles without looking at us or turning back when we asked him for glasses or cups.. the passenger sitting next to us said (what's his Problem) and got up and got us the cups himself. 45 minutes later... About almost 4 hours into the flight.. my brother asked for wine.. the same attendant YOUNIS became So agitated, made a “Time Out” gesture with his hand and said NO.. FINISHED. And turned around... I called him immediately saying what is your problem why are you so rude he came so close up in my face and pointed at the bottles saying HOW MANY DID YOU HAVE?? i could not believe what was happening and this uncalled for rudeness and said Can you stop talking to us like we're kids?? And be polite and do your job?? We had one in 4 hours and you're not allowed to point your fingers and talk to us like we're BOTHERING YOU... And i asked for his name and he said it hesitantly.. His colleague. Or manager (very nice guy who seemed like supervisor or manager) told him to go get wine.. after that.. he didn't even PASS BY OUR ISLE once.... and kept avoiding me for the rest of the flight.
I work for the Government of Canada,..I travel between 10 and 25 times a YEAR.. I've been on bad flights before but these flights combined have been nothing but horrible.. and the lack of respect and tact at the last flight just made it worse... Right after being stuck in broken seat.. been asked to bribe everywhere in the airport.. told there are no hotel rooms and didn't get air maroc hotel voucher although there were few empty ones that i had to bribe to get AND pay for… And at the end, after filing few complaints and talking to agents and emailing Air Maroc, they offer me a voucher for 60 Euros to be used within a Year.. No real compensation, No real apology, No explanations for their horrible airlines and horrible service…",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/71/42/4d/abebourgi.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbeBourgi,AbeBourgi wrote a review Aug 2016,AbeBourgi,"Ottawa, Canada",6 contributions,18 helpful votes,Montreal - Beirut,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r410978966-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Horrible Experience , Never EVER again !",Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Avoid at all prices this ''company''. Attracted by the low prices to fly to Rio, I decided to give RAM a try. I am flying around 10 times a year between Latin America and Europe for working reasons and that was definitely my last time with RAM !

- Very unprofessional staff. During the whole flight, some people were walking around, staying so much time in the place where food is stocked, talking loudly, etc., while the staff would never do anything about it. Even during turbulence's. Incredible.
- Worst was to come when arriving in Rio. ALL passengers that had a stop in Casablanca from Europe either lost their bags or got stolen some things. We were more than 10 people to be complaining ! A Brazilian had his bag opened and all his valuables/papers stolen.
- It was even worse for me and a few other tourists: our bags did not make it !
In fact, I did my 3 first days in Rio without my bag full of clothes. Horrible situation and super annoying. Then my bag arrived in my place, 3 days after making it to Brazil...
- As told by the crew in Rio, I went to buy some clothes and sent a receipt / proof to the Customer Service of Air Maroc. They NEVER answered me ! I sent around 10 emails. They were so fast at answering me when I had questions about buying a ticket but not so much now.

I wonder if they will manage to avoid an accident before going bankrupt.

"Flew from Marrakech in May 2014. My agent had pre ordered veg meals for two of our party which is confirmed on the paperwork. When the air host brought the food he accused us of not ordering it and said 'not my problem'. He became aggressive and pointed in my face saying 'I am not your slave in the sky'. I was polite and calm at all points during the confrontation but he was clearly trying to provoke me.
My 1 year old daughter was not given a meal as she was 'too young' to qualify. I kindly asked for them to give my meal which I did not take due to being meat, but was refused until I explained there were two meals not used by our party.
On my return I decided to make a formal complaint as the experience was so bad. Unfortunately this is where it got worse!
Having searched for some time I finally found an email address to send a complaint to. After no response for sometime I decided to call the numbers on the sites but they were only sales offices and could not help. I decide to contact the UK office who gave me the details for head office and the name of the CEO.
Immediatly I was contacted by the Manager of Customer Service & Quality Control, Maryam El Boury, who called me to apologise for the experience onboard and the compalint. She assured me that the air host was reprimand and dealt with. I explained I was not so sure as I was not asked to give further information or names of the witnesses I collected from around me. How can you reprimand without getting statements?
Maryam El Boury said that she would like to convince me to use the airline again and offered air miles as compensation. I asked if the miles offered would cover me and my family to make the round trip to Marrakech again, to which she said yes. I asked again for clarity.
Maryam told me that she will email me the details in the next day. After a few days I chased this up and received an email about air miles. It did not make much sense to I replied asking again for clarity that this allowed me and my family fly return to Marrakech... no response. I emailed again, this time I got a message saying the information is in the letter and print. I explained that it did not make sense, but still no clarity of confirmation.
I called a few days later and was told that I was misunderstood and in fact the air miles allowed me alone to fly a sort distance alone, but only after booking and paying for a return flight for the family!! I was furious but told nothing more can be done.
We spoke to the PA to the President, Ms. Soubaa who was also very apologetic. She asked for this in writing and we followed up weeks later only to be told that it was already dealt with and that is the end of the matter. We asked to speak to the CEO and refused... we asked for an email address and refused. We asked how to send an email to him and she replied to send it to her, but she stated it would not be passed on.
I decided to entertain my complain via social media and put the complaint on twitter... I received an immediate response saying they will look into the matter. This has gone on for months and overtime I chase it up the response it almost automated ""we apologise for the delay but head office are looking into the matter and will respond soon', but soon never comes.
I look back and think to how things may have been much worse if the air host had succeeded in antagonising me.. I guess it would have been me in great trouble.

"RAM seems to be one of the better choices for getting to small African countries, via Casablanca.  The aircraft was clean and the cabin crew efficient (though lacking a little in friendliness).  The on-board food was OK (usual choice of chicken mush or beef sludge with associated pots of salad and undefined sweet goo).  The transfer at Casablanca is surprisingly easy and the airport there relatively efficient.  The problem with many such flights is often not the airline or crew but the other passengers who may not be used to flying and break the carefully crafted etiquette of international air travel (standing up, pressing the call button, snoring, kicking the seats).",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pharehaven,Pharehaven wrote a review Aug 2016,Pharehaven,"Brighton, United Kingdom",184 contributions,108 helpful votes,London - Lome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r406500526-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,A reasonable way to get to Africa,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My trip on Royal Air Maroc from JFK to Casablanca was a nightmare.  The plane was filthy (it was the same plane in both directions--maybe they only have one plane for this route).  Flight attendants were all but absent--people dropped food in the aisles and it remained there for the whole flight.  I had my call light on for 25 minutes when I finally got up and looked for someone so I could get a glass of water.  I found four male attendants in the back just sitting around talking with one another.  When I asked for some water they pointed me toward a bottle of it.  No interest whatsoever.  I never saw a smile or heard a kind comment from any of the flight attendants. I also have never been on a flight with so many children and screaming babies.  Neither the parents or flight attendants tried to help or distract the children.  It was complete chaos.The food was awful.  For an airline that originates from the Middle East they actually served ham (forbidden by Islam) and cheese on a stale roll for our breakfast.  The ""dinner"" had mystery meats, which were supposed to be chicken or beef--neither my husband or I could eat our meals.  The tray tables were broken, the seats would not recline--the selections of films or TV were ancient or just plain silly.On our return trip from Casablanca our luggage went through an x-ray machine when we came into the terminal, then we went through normal security lines, and THEN, we had to wait on-line at our gate while indifferent agents opened every one of our already cleared bags again, tossing and churning the contents of every handbag, carryon, and/or computer case.  We were then all subjected to a thorough pat-down--men out in the open and women put into a little booth that looked like the old-fashioned photo booths with black curtains.  The flight takeoff was delayed for over a half an hour while this nonsense played out.  There was no one at the gate to explain what was going on--all they did was shove us through like cattle.I will NEVER fly another Royal (""royal"" what a laugh) Air Maroc flight again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaRyanOrange,RRO wrote a review Aug 2016,RRO,"Orange, CT",225 contributions,154 helpful votes,New York City - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r401851292-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,One of the dirtiest planes in the air,Date of travel: May 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I took this flight due to the price and wasn't disappointed.
It was a 3hr flight from London to Casablanca, a 6 hour layover followed by a 4 hour flight to Accra - both flights were on 737-700s.
I'm not the tallest (5""10) but was very comfortable legroom wise on both flights.
The service wasn't the friendliest I have ever experienced but everything was done with a smile and the crew were helpful enough.
The food was, again, not stellar but very acceptable. You'll get a hot meal at the very least as well as a full drinks service and teas and coffees.
Don't let any potential long layover put you off, there are places to sit, eat and shop in the airport as well as a transit hotel (-€40 for a short stay). There is very strong, quite fast free wifi for 3 hours per device so you can easily pass the time.

"we booked a flight with Royal Air Maroc after they launched an online campaign that they renewed their service. It was indeed renewed the flight was executed by tunis air a fairly new plane, with an outlived exterior which came strait out of a pan am plane. all worn out and not cleaned for a while.
The worst part about the flight was that is was canceled and they didn't bothered to announce it at the airport while everyone was waiting already for 2 hours. after 6 hours they gave us the opportunity to reschedule our flight to the next one, which already was overbooked so fights broke out because not everyone could board the plane.

it was a renewed experience which i don't want to experience again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrtjin,mrtjin wrote a review Aug 2016,mrtjin,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",7 contributions,,Al Hoceima - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r400391788-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,cattle is transported with more care,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Couldn't fly from southern Spain (malaga) to Casablanca without connecting through barcelona or Madrid and burning up a lot of time and more money.  It happened that Avis allowed me to drop the rental car off in Gibraltar and I wanted to see it anyway so I booked a flight from there.  Cost was about 1/3 of those out of Malaga. Originally had planned to take a ferry from Tarifa, then train to Casablanca.  Would have had to drop car in Malaga, bus to Tarifa, ferry to Tangier then train to Casablanca and then all taxi fares in between.  The entire trip only took about 1.5hrs with a short stop in Tangier and then a train directly from the airport to downtown Casablanca.

"I called the customer service of royal air maroc for a simple question and the lady on phone was just so rude I had to write this review. All I was asking for was a basic information I needed before booking my flight , I was not calling to complain or to demand anything.
When I checked online travel websites the cheapest flight to my destination had a 20h layover, the information about transit visas is not very clear on their website and all i wanted to know was if i could get a transit visa at the airport that would allow me
to leave the airport during that period or I needed to get a visa from the consulate before flying.
I wasn't asking any favors just information so that i didn't end up having to sleep at the airport.
The woman I talked to after listening to the initial request put me on hold while she asked the question probably to someone else but when she got back on the phone was not clear in her answer to my initial question and just talked super rudely without letting me speak so that i couold clarify my request , it's not like i expected her to do anyting and than at the end she just hung up on me.
I did finally find out no thanks to her that no you can not get a visa on arrival for my nationality as i'm not european so i guess i'm flying another airlines.
I mean even if you have a negative answer to someone's question , it's just information and you can use a more polite tone of voice !

"Recently travelled to Benin, West Africa to meet client and I had to use Expedia for flight booking as the Royal Air Maroc site is so difficult to make and confirm a booking!

The flight itself from London Gatwick to Cotonou with a 5 hour wait in Casablanca then onto Cotonou was okay, service was reasonable and I would say that overall I would use the airline again.

Seat was roomy although it only reclined a little making it difficult to sleep.

The food selection was pretty good too and the staff were for the most part friendly although not all of them.

My suitcase was badly damaged on the outbound flight from LGW to Cotonou and when I tried to report it in Benin no-one wanted to assist, language was also a problem as no-one appeared to speak English though that is not their fault, when I landed back in Gatwick I tried to report the damage however again no-one wanted to help, even the agent at LGW, GBS (Global Baggage Services) told me to go online and 'fill in a form'

"I booked this mission trip to Liberia before reading all the worrying reviews online. Of course, I was nervous on reading what others have said, especially when we couldn't check in online - presumably due to a technical glitch since all went smoothly from our arrival at Heathrow onwards. In fact, for our part, we couldn't fault the service. Unlike our dreadful experience when flying to the same destination with Air France a few years ago (all four separately checked in suitcases lost in Casablanca), there was no lost luggage, friendly check in desks and flight attendants, decent food (the veggie dinners were cold on the outbound flight, but at least we GOT them, unlike the unforgettable Air France experience).

When we had to change our return flights subject to a delay in receiving our mission goods at customs, their office in central Monrovia was very helpful, especially Zoe M Nuinoe who found us the best price for our return journey.

All in all, the flights themselves were perfect, and we were seated next to the lovely UK Ambassador for Liberia on our outbound journey. If it's good enough for him, it's good enough for us!

I would have given Air Maroc five stars, but for the technical glitches. Not only is it difficult if not impossible to check in online at times, but even signing up for their loyalty card is so frustrating that most people give up.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DemiDee777,DemiDee777 wrote a review Jul 2016,DemiDee777,"East Midlands, United Kingdom",26 contributions,4 helpful votes,London - Monrovia,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r396546742-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Feared the worst, yet got the best",Date of travel: March 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew with Royal Air Maroc from Nairobi to London, via Casablanca in April 2016. I spent a lot of time emailing them before to ensure that the meal I paid for would be something that I could eat (I am a Vegan) After much discussion as they didnt know what a vegan was (!) They agreed to the meal. On both flights they didnt have any dietry requirements recorded for me! The staff on board did the best they could to gather me bits to eat, however for such long flights it just wasnt enough. On my return I emailed their customer service team, who eventually gave me the contact details for their complaint department, who after I have emailed about 4 time, I still have had no reply.

"Travelled from Rio de Janeiro to Casablanca. When I got on the aircraft I thought the aircraft had actually just arrived from Morocco. Turns out it had just come from Sao Paulo, an hour's flight. Entering the cabin one could be forgiven for thinking that there had been a wild party. Pillows were lying in the aisles, on the floor, squashed into the seats, and blankets were lying allover the place, with plastic cups and other trash stuck here and there, and used head sets thrown about. Disgusting......did it ever occur to anyone to clean the aircraft?
When most people had boarded, there was an announcement that everyone should take their bags from the overhead compartments. Most people had no idea what was being said as the announcement was in Arabic and French. Apparently another passenger had forgotten a bag, so the cabin crew was looking for it. They found one that nobody claimed, and a stewardess was taking it away when a Moroccan guy said it was his. She let fly at him verbally like I have never seen anyone and was shouting and ranting at him.
The food was appalling. The bread roll was hard, the margarine tasted like industrial chemical, and the coffee was nauseating. The main meal was marginally better.
Eventually the crew disappeared after the meal, and were rarely seen again unless passing into the business class cabin. Stretching my legs down the back, I spied a trolley parked in a corner with juice and water and soda and plastic cups and half opened bags of pretzels. It was self service. I was not aware of any announcement that this was available, but we did help ourselves.
The cabin crew was singularly disinterested in doing its job-it was almost as though it was a nuisance to deign to work.
Maybe these guys are poorly paid? I have no idea but I'd fire them on the spot, and give the job to some young Moroccans who would relish the opportunity of international travel. They really let the airline down, although possibly the airline has let them down.
Next day I flew to Lisbon with RAM...boarding was chaotic, and once on board, there was a technical problem, and the AC was turned off. It was 38c outside, and within a minute people were calling for the AC to be turned on. The crew ignored everyone,until people got up, whereupon they opened the rear and front doors to allow a draught through.The also began to offer people cups of water. There was one particular steward, who when asked something in Portuguese by a passenger replied in an angry tone"" Talk English I don't talk Portuguese"". The passenger shook his head, and the steward muttered a profanity as he glanced at the guy. Incredible! Again, if you don't like your job, quit. Having said that, the head cabin crew member was incredibly courteous and attentive-a passenger in my row was acting strangely(stress?) aad she gently asked him if he was alright, and she watched him each time she passed by. The second male flight attendant was very pleasant and courteous.
I wonder if a national airline is reflective of the country that owns it? Very possibly, but someone seriously needs to teach many of the cabin crew how to deal with the public. With the exception of 2 staff, the others really let the airline down...but then,does the airline support the staff?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/ec/0a/2e/irishtreeguy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irishtreeguy,Irishtreeguy wrote a review Jul 2016,Irishtreeguy,,29 contributions,7 helpful votes,Rio de Janeiro - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r395272054-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Fawlty Towers of the skies,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nowadays, there aren't many options to travel from London to Sierra Leone with a decent level of comfort for a reasonable price.

Royal Air Maroc flies on convenient times (although the four hour lay-over in Casablanca is not ideal) from both Gatwick and London Heathrow.

The booking platform on the website, and subsequent online check in is actually very convenient and gets you ready for your trip in no-time (loved the option to add your boarding pass to Apple Wallet).

I'd say, that's where the experience stops. We've had to call customer service to change our flight and the person we spoke to was plain rude.

The planes are old (to say the least) and the staff's English leaves a lot to be desired. The plane smelled like it had been smoked in when we got on board. Food onboard is terrible, so I've decided to skip.

The Casablanca airport is not great (rest rooms are shocking), but the Paul's restaurant is a good spot to spend your time waiting (with decent WiFi for aprox. 1.5 hrs).

Upon arrival at the Freetown Lungi airport, one of my bags turned out to be missing. It arrived the next day.

"We arrived at Casablanca airport 2 hours before our flight was due to leave, only to be told that it had already left, because it had been changed to an hour earlier. No one had contacted us telling us this was the case. Many others were in the same position. Our flights were then transferred to the next flight, which was in 6 hours time.

Obviously, we thought the least the airline could do was give us access to the VIP lounge area, considering they'd completely stuffed up.

We inquired with a male manager at the check in desk, who literally put up his hand, said 'shh' and proceeded to text his friend on Viber. When we told him what we sought, he just said, 'no, it is impossible'.

We then found a female manager who was much more gracious and competent. She arranged for us to get access to the lounge, and had our special case entered into the airport's online system so that our position could be verified at the lounge front desk.

When we arrived at the lounge front desk, the woman waved us away saying, 'only business class, not you'. We explained our situation. She cut us off, telling us 'no'. She told us to 'go away' and proceeded to politely serve everyone but us. We literally had to stand there, being blatantly ignored, as the 'worthy' people were seen to.

We stressed that we had been granted access to the lounge because of a major imposition at the airline's fault. She once again, incredibly rudely, told us that we could not come in and that we had to leave. Finally, after we refused to leave, she called the manager to whom we had referred this entire time, who told her that yes- of course we had access- it was detailed on our ticket information on the online system, as we had said.

When the lady realized she was wrong, she literally threw our tickets at us, and said 'you can go in'. She was truly horrible.

We are incredibly unimpressed, and will never be flying with Royal Air Maroc again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaddyG632,Maddy G wrote a review Jul 2016,Maddy G,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",3 contributions,4 helpful votes,Casablanca - Marseille,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r390620709-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,"Truly awful, rude and incompetent service",Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Tragic folks, the Royal Air Morocco people are and it's a shame because Morocco is such a beautiful country with so many beautiful people! Along with passport control (I am an American citizen) in the chaotic Casablanca Airport, they basically kept me from boarding my plane even though I was early to the airport and on time for the plane (the plane itself was even 30 minutes late in departing..). Then they promised me a replacement flight for the next day and hotel accommodations overnight.

"T4 at LHR was great - really empty. Check-in was slow but eventually seen then found a business lounge air side which was great. Flight to Casablanca was OK - got an aisle seat. Bag wait and passport queue at Casablanca was not good but expected. Not run well - worse to come on the return.
Way back - totally pants from start to finish. Big shoving queue to enter the terminal where only travelers are allowed in - not a bad idea but not good when they surround the entrance and prevent travelers getting in. One Xray machine = long queue and lots of bad people pushing in thinking they are somebody special. Nearly had to tell a guy off who kept ramming his trolley into my legs. Two stern looks put him off eventually.
Check-in - totally dreadful - slow and at front of queue with one hour left and needing the loo. Billie-no-stars on check-in did not know his job and just took ages over everything. Eventually done and off to security and passports - passports seen 4 times, all separately. That took ages. Then finally into T2. needed the loo but, get this, only 2 toilets in the whole of that terminal and a queue. Another 15 minute wait with crossed legs. By the time I had had my pee (just two cubicles available, no urinals... and very unpleasant) the flight was boarding but bused to the plane. All in all avoid this airport.

"The flight was overall satisfactory.  As far as I know, it is the only non-stop flight from Morocco to the USA.  I would take this flight again for this reason.  There are several problems with Royal Air Maroc. (1) The website is totally inadequate.  You cannot check your reservation or change it. (2) There are no special meals, e.g., gluten free.  I could not eat the food since I have an allergy to gluten. (3) You cannot check in online.  (4) The information on the boards at the airport was wrong -- wrong gate.  They knew this & did not change it.  (5) The WIFI did not work in the VIP lounge.  (6) The speakers were very loud in the VIP lounge and in the main terminal. It was unpleasant. (7) On a flight to the USA they had no newspapers in English.  (8) The security process at Casablanca was uncomfortable, crowded, and inadequate. (9) The Business Class seat was not comfortable & was much inferior to a regular Business seat on a main airline. (10) The seat belt was too short.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway802738,DAD/BOB wrote a review Jun 2016,DAD/BOB,DURHAM,63 contributions,65 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r381421999-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,ADEQUATE BUT NOT GOOD,Date of travel: June 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had been warned against taking Royal Air Moroc as they had a history of poor service, canceled flights and late flights.  I took a chance because it was a non-stop flight.

Next time I had been travelling to Laayoune with a stop in Casablanca for a day. Despite all international rules my bag had not been issued to me to pass the Customs in Casa - it had been delivered with my next flight right to Laayoune - where there is no Customs...

"On Feb 12th, I was booked to travel to Marrakech under Samuel Springer. I was awaiting an appointment with USCIS for my US Citizenship of Naturalization. The date was unknown, so the flight was booked at the going affordable price. After acquiring my US Citizenship of Naturalization, my name was changed to Samuel Fitzgerald, which was reflected in my new US passport. Expedia was unable to change my last name on the ticket without approval from Royal Air Maroc (RAM).

RAM communicated that providing satisfactory proof of my name change on the day of the flight would have allowed me to board the plane. However, at JFK airport, RAM reviewed my identification documents confirming my legal name change but still insisted that Expedia updated my ticket to match my passport.

However, RAM refused to cooperate after Expedia continuously requested the authorization necessary to refresh the ticket.

"I prayed for the first time in a flight. I needed a short flight to return to work in Angola and R. A. Morocco had the shortest and cheapest option.
THE STAFF: The staff was somewhat rude and had wrinkled or dirty shirts. At one moment one of them dropped the a food item he collected from us and instead of picking it up he kicked it under a seat.
THE FOOD: PASS IT! BRING YOUR OWN!
THE AIRPLANE: the airplane was OLD and had tags of the Air Italia on their seats (second hand maybe?). The sound system was faulty (very loud) and the lights would not dim during the overnight flight. There is no flight entertainment. I found an employee taping the emergency light strips to the ground when we boarded. One of the bathrooms had the doors tapped and not operational. Quite a few chairs were dirty, broken, not straight, or could not recline.
THE PILOTS: a special thank you to them for taking us to our destination safely.
I do not plan to fly with them again and DO NOT recommend it for people flying to Angola.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PreciEvy,PreciEvy wrote a review Mar 2016,PreciEvy,"Luanda, Angola",1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Casablanca - Luanda,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r355945212-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Air plane was old with broken chairs and ill mannered staff,Date of travel: April 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Tunisia to Casablanca, then from Casa to Agadir. It was so confortable during the first flight, a 2h30mn flight. Crew where so nice, smiling and helpful. Food comparing to other companies is decent and tasty for an economic class. music played in the plane was so relaxing, I can hear it even now when I close my eyes.
The second flight ( 45mn flight) was so basic, a small place took us. Well I can understand that. But crew was very warm and helpful.

I wish my flight was longer.

"I flew with them a couple of weeks ago. I have previously. Everything was fine the first time just the food for me was terrible!.. I was hoping the food this time would be better, though again the chicken, while not as terrible, was just too bland with no flavour, or the wrong flavour maybe. I've never tasted anything like this in Morocco, or the world! Salt and pepper did help, but not so much! Apart from that........... the flight was excellent, comfortable, on time.

"Not sure whether I should credit Royal Air Maroc or Boeing for this! The flights - on a 787 Dreamliner - were great. As Boeing promised there was barely any jetlag, the atmosphere seemed much more congenial, the window shading was wonderful. Must credit RAM for the generous leg room, comfortable seating and very good entertainment system (even though it was not working at my seat on the outbound flight!) Food was not gourmet but appropriate to our class of service. Ground service was good. Nice check-in people. They boarded at JFK with no reference to our row assignments but it did not seem to make much difference at all. Was not that pleased with the overbearing security people at Casablanca - happily taking the water bottle I has JUST purchased, beyond immigration, and  smashing it on the floor behind them and appropriating tiny shaver cartridges and AA batteries. But only a few days after my CMN-JFK flight  Paris happened so perhaps I should not be too critical. Back to the airline - it was all excellent or at least good. And the airline provides a pleasant and quick way to get from the US to Morocco without unnecessary layovers in Paris or London or elsewhere in Western Europe and is certainly a good choice.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vox69nn,vox69nn wrote a review Mar 2016,vox69nn,"Medina, Ohio",2133 contributions,205 helpful votes,Casablanca - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729136-r352500175-Royal_Air_Maroc-World.html,Flew from US to Morocco and back on Royal Air Maroc,Date of travel: November 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had a very long flight with Royal Air Maroc from Montreal to Casablanca, to Dakar, back to Casablanca, then to Praia, and finally Sal, Cape Verde in January. I asked and was authorized to eliminate an unnecessary return Casablanca-Dakar portion before departure at the Dorval counter (in retrospect, I should have asked for that authorization in writing!); I was  simply told to collect my tagged luggage and check it in again in Casablanca for the last leg of my trip. Firstly, my brand new Roots bag had a cut about 3"" long, clearly made deliberately with a blade in one of the side pockets, which I got no apologies , nor any offer to compensate from the Company when I showed it to them. Then, when attempting to check in again as per requested, I was told it was not allowed and I would have to buy a brand new ticket! Then,after I argued and called the supervisor, he maintained his story about my flying itinerary supposedly being illegal, but claimed that he could arrange to bypass it and issue me a boarding pass if I was prepared to pay a 'cash penalty' of first 500$, and then in the end 250$, which was to be paid in nothing else but $, and upon departure at the gate!Well, sure enough, not only did the guy catch up with me and demand the said $, but when an unaware colleague of his let me through since my boarding pass was in order, the culprit sent another attendant colleague chasing me down the stairs to the shuttle bus to press me for that $ again, until I made it clear to him that I was categorically refusing  to pay any penalty in cash without an invoice & receipt and a credit card option, to which he finally let me go...

I liked the fact that you can go to sleep and wake up in Morocco. The big problems for people flying out of Florida is that the jet blue terminal and RAMs is like an hour walking.

"I flew 4 segments on Royal Air Maroc last december. Check-ins were fine, they did not mind about a small extra weight on the checked volumes. All flights were good, no delays and easy boarding. The problem is not the company, but the airports and their officials in Morocco, they are too slow. The first 2 flights, short hauls, had no meal, only beverages, even on business class. The medium haul with a stop in Munich was made on Embraer EMB195, a very nice brand new airplane. Food was about average on both legs.

AT469 DEC14 07:55 Casablanca (CMN) to Ouarzazate (OZZ) // AT441 DEC27 05:00 Fez (FEZ) to Casablanca (CMN) / AT220 DEC27 11:15 Casablanca (CMN) to Moscow (SVO) via Munich (MUC).

Company website is very basic and not very friendly. Could use some improvement. Connections are not easy, even when flying from major cities in the country, you need to wait 4 to 6 hours for your next flight.

Overall experience was good.

Super crew, nice comfy seat by the emergency exit again, the flight was over before I knew it.

It was a full-up flight, but the crew got everything done and even managed to do the duty free.

The food was fine, a good selection of soft drinks as well as Moroccan wines for those who like alcohol with their meals.

"They have never let me down. On the last trip we were on time, the crew was friendly and efficient, the food had been revamped too.

The legroom was adequate, especially as I had reserved a seat on the emergency exit. However, the pitch is fine for short-haul even without that advantage.

The planes are modern 737 aircraft on most of the routes I've been on including this one.

Prices are reasonable, although they are dearer than on an LCC, of course. However, the convenience of flying out of Casablanca and into Heathrow makes up for that.
