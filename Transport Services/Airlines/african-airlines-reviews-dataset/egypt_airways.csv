"My wife and I went to Egypt to celebrate our 28th anniversary. We flew Turkish Air 👍 from our home in Miami, FL to Cairo, EG. Within Egypt we booked our flight from Cairo to Luxor and from Luxor to Rome with connection in Cairo on Egyptair👎.

The staff is very rude and they have very poor communication skills. The airline doesn't have much handicap resources. On our trip from Luxor to Cairo international airport we flew on a 737-800 aircraft. Almost at the end of the boarding process, the flight attendant close the forward aircraft door and the aircraft started taxing while passengers were still getting seated.

When we arrived in Cairo for our connection, there were little or no staff help to direct passengers on where to go for their connection. We finally made it to our gate from CAI (Cairo) to FCO (Rome). We were 25mins from take off and nothing was happening at the gate. I walked up to the an male agent at the counter and waiting there for about 8mins and he never once looked at me or attempted to facilitate my question.

I simply walked away after he wouldn't acknowledge me. I also noticed two more passengers walking up to the counter and was treated the same. I will probably never travel on Egyptair in the future. My wife and I travel a lot within the US and international and spend a lot of money on air, hotels and car rental. I hope Egyptair reads these reviews and take take to steps to better improve their services.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Priyarah1,Shiva Raghunanan wrote a review Yesterday,Shiva Raghunanan,,1 contribution,,Luxor - Rome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r870189458-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst Airline Service,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Yes, the planes and the amenities are not super modern and high tech but both flights departed and arrived on time, luggage was not lost and delivered promptly, the crew was polite, hospitable and helpful, food was plentiful and tasty, and security procedures put in place are commendable.

"We unfortunately had no choice but to use this airline to fly back from our honeymoon. We chose to do a layover in Egypt to see the pyramids and we could not be happier to be back home. However there were so many hiccups flying back. The washrooms were filthy and not maintained during the flight. There were passengers smoking in the washroom and no flight attendants enforced the no smoking policy. Then during the 7 hour delay due to fog, we were not offered any food nor water. It wasn’t until a passenger started screaming, did they finally go around offering water.

We were starving during this delay, which was no fault on the airline. However they could have offered food and water. I can’t imagine if I was diabetic. Then when we asked for food, they only gave food to Egyptian passengers. It seems there was some discrimination.

I will never fly with this airline again.

"I have to admit I chose this airline because it was the cheapest way of getting from a to b so I wasn’t expecting much. However we were delayed for over two hours sitting on the tarmac at Heathrow due to missing our slot after a delay in boarding. This made the connection at Cairo for our onward flight to Johannesburg dicey.

Once onboard the flight crew were dismissive and uninterested. The food was dire and exactly the same on both flights. The inflight entertainment was very limited and yes I know Egypt is an Islamic country, but the drinks offering were completely dry. If Etihad and Emirates can offer a wine menu, so could EGYPTAIR.

The only thing I can say on a positive note is that the legroom was good and both landings were textbook.

"I booked my flight 8 months in advance, so I got a decent price. I have had 3 time changes in the space of two months, I was a travel agent for 7 years so I can deal with that. The last time change, they moved and confirmed my flight from Cairo to Abu Dhabi so it landed after my other flight had already left, I called to fix this and was told it's the only flight, I went on their website and they had plenty, so I called back and three times, everytime I was hung up on, they kept telling me my only option was to cancel, as soon as i mention their flight availability then they'd hang up. Now I have no option but to cancel and rebook something 4 times the price I paid.
I also flew Egypt Air to Luxor and Aswan and their boarding process is just chaos, there is no structure, instead of one line it's just a whole bunch of passengers nearly fighting to get on, so safe to say the boarding took well over an hour and we were an hour and a half delayed. The service on board is non existent regardless if you're in business or not, then they somehow ripped my lock and zipper off my luggage, it had a TSA lock so there's no excuse to not be able to open it, if need be.

"I had travelled once before with this airline and had an average travel experience so i thought to to try again. The flight was more than one and a half hours late and no one notified the passengers of the delay and what was happening. Safe to say the passengers with connecting flights (me included) were overly anxious. Just before boarding they brought in a group of about 10 families that was very rowdy. In flight, the flight attendants were very overwhelmed and kept skipping people during service and asking for options for meals.

I had purchased two extra bags for a total of 250 USD and one was lost on arrival. I reported to the Swissport office that managed such claims and they assured me that they would be in touch as soon as the bag was found. I had to keep following up, after numerous emails almost 2months later i still haven't received my bag and have little hope for doing so. No one has appeared apologetic or caring for my requests until i make email threats which take forever to be responded to.

"I have been very patient with Egypt air for the last three months waiting for them to solve the issue.

The gate agent came around checking in gate bags and we told him the security had our belongings, so he went to the security guard for it. He refused to give it to him. It was nothing illegal, just a wood walking stick. Needless to say, Egypt Air was supposedly investigating the case since 3 months ago, and I just got an email saying the security department didn’t find it. I would think that the security department would know exactly who was working that flight so why did they not take appropriate action against their employees, and return what belongs to us!

We flew multiple times with Egypt air during September and October. By far the worst airline I’ve ever travelled with. Ever single flight delayed. One was 3 hrs delayed. No apology. No reason given.

"YOU SKIP THIS HEADS-UP AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Do not ever board Egypt air from UAE to any part of Africa.

All their options including the most expensive economy have long hours of layover yet its STRICTLY no accomodation for anyone to and from UAE.

You will be forced to sleep on the hard chairs amidst the mosquitoes and the cold atmosphere.

Their staffs are arrogant, very rude and treat you like you begged them to let you fly with them.

They would shut you down arrogantly and leave you with no explanation.

Unfortunately for me I booked a round trip so I had to go through this horrible situation twice.

Their seats are dirty and my phone was all soiled up after accidentally dropping it in the pocket behind the seat.

My luggage delayed for 2days upon reaching and I had to drive for over 3hrs just to come back for my luggage.

By far this has been the most humiliating and embarrassing moment of my travel life as a blogger.

It might cost you a little extra but its worth it choosing other airlines over Egypt air.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackalphatv,Black Alpha wrote a review Oct 2022,Black Alpha,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Dubai - Accra,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r865055214-EGYPTAIR-World.html,No accomodation for all UAE travellers,Date of travel: October 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"To be fare, I used Egyptair for my yesterday from bey to cairo then from Cairo to Accra .
The first flight was on time and was very good, the portion served was very good for a 45 mins of flight.
The second one was delayed for 1 hr but it is not the end of the life it is ok and the flight was good and the portion given was very good. the chicken plate was not tasty but everything else is perfect.

So usually only the bad feedbakc are written on the website don't be afraid of using egyptair of course if you are not planning for a 5 stars airplane . I can rate them as 3.5-4 stars airline ,

Also flight attendants aren’t trained well, as soon as the plane landed people started standing up and rushing to the front of the plane (even when the seatbelt sign was on) and the flight attendants didn’t even say one word.

"I booked 4 flights with this company, one to Egypt, Cairo from Tunis and 3 within Egypt.

My first flight, Tunis to Cairo was the first problem and the most stressful situation, I was denied boarding.

The reason? My flight to Cairo was with EGYPTAIR, but my return flight was with Aegean. They did not like this, some bull**** company policy. First time EVER IN MY LIFE I HEAR SO RIDICULOUS POLICY. Of course I wouldn’t settle with this crap, I’ve traveled a lot, and see a lot and they would not succeed with their “hidden scam” of making me buy another return ticket with them. So I demanded immediately a supervisor. So the checkin person told me go to the office and complain there, without doing much more.

At the office the guy first reaction was “yeah it is impossible to get into Egypt with different airlines” both need to be EGYPTAIR. I told him that this was nonsense, that they can’t do that. My passport was in order, my VISA was approved, and I had my girlfriend on the same conditions as me, flying from Frankfurt with Lufthansa and returning with Aegean. The guy started checking my documents until he asked “are you European”, and started looking at all the stamps on my passport. So I’m Hungarian. What if I was from somewhere else? Is this discrimination from EGYPTAIR to some people?

Anyway, he started making calls and asking the Egypt or Cairo migrations. He told me go to the checkin and wait there. After 10 minutes he came and my ticket was printed. I don’t know who this guy/supervisor was but without him I don’t think I’d have travel, so thank you!

The whole situation was just unbelievable, I contacted the agency that sold me the tickets and they reacted with “we never heard of such thing”, “they can’t deny boarding if your visa is approved”.

So for me was a happy ending, if you are reading this be prepared to deal with this non-sense policy or choose other airline. Maybe you’d pay a bit more but at least you won’t need to deal with this during your vacations.

At the time writing this, I’m awaiting a response from the booking company which promised me to go deeper into this matter.

Safe travels!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucky8919,Lucas wrote a review Oct 2022,Lucas,,7 contributions,3 helpful votes,Tunis - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r862887006-EGYPTAIR-World.html,They take advantage of tourists,Date of travel: October 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In our Egypt trip we had booked 6 flights on EGYPTAIR, including international and domestic. And 5 of the 6 flights were a minimum of 20 minutes late. They don’t even announce on the boards that the flights are delayed, they just change the departure times every time and keep it as on time. It’s so bad for international travelers who don’t know the country because our transport in Luxor had left when we arrived and there was no-one willing to help us. Also, the food is really basic on the international leg, we got a roll with 1 slice of cheese for breakfast, like it didn’t even have butter on the roll and the cheese was so small that I was mostly a dry roll. The female air hostesses also need some serious training in people skills, they are simply OBNOXIOUS! I had one literally scream at me for the whole plane to hear that the toilet I was waiting in front of was for Business class only, this was at the end of our flight and my seat was at the front of the economy class section, and throughout the flight other passengers from economy kept using that toilet with no issues. I mean there are no signs either way. But you would never be spoken to like this by hostesses from Qatar, Emirates or Singapore Airlines whose staff are so excellently trained and friendly. I was appalled. I hear other hostesses shouting at other passengers for other things throughout the flight as well, how do you treat your guests in this manner? To make matters worse, the aircon in the plane does not work properly, we were all boiling hot in the 7 hour flight back home trying to fan ourselves and not being able to breathe. I felt like I was on a cheap tour bus honestly.
We only used this airline because it was best for the trip to Egypt, but I will never recommend them or use them again. I will stick to the other brilliant Middle Eastern airlines even if it means I have to travel for a full 24 hours to my destination.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochellev993,Rochelle V wrote a review Sep 2022,Rochelle V,,2 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r862556122-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst airline I’ve travelled with,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I started on my 1st flight on the morning of the 23rd September, 1st off, the flight attendants all male bar one, old, and not a smile on one fac at all, not welcoming in any way.
I thought they were pilots doing some sort of punishments as they seemed to hate their jobs. Of course the plane was a 777 or something like that so it was old and the infotainment system was a disaster. it hardly worked for a start and when iot did there was nothing but old shows and rubbish to watch.
The plane did not have individual aircon and it felt like I was in a Sauna for 12 hours. Being hot as hell they do not offer drinks, only water and juice and only 1ce in a 12 hr flight.
I had to get up, waking the old man next to me, just to get water, and when I asked the guy for water it was like I asked if I could sleep with his wife.
Oh My word what a horrific flight.

Then, flight 2 from Ciro to JHB, the plane was a 787 so it was up market, but we had a 1 hr delay on the plane before take off, with only the captain coming online telling us we have a 15 min delay and he was sorry, well he is quite clearly not aware of how time works.
Again, only male flight attendants and the same thing, we got someones soggy sandwiches for food wrapped in plastic and then no fluids on the plane.
Then offering coffee they ran past us not even giving you a chance to ask, when I did finally catch them, again, I could have been asking to sleep with his wife.

Mornings breakfast was an unbuttered role with a thick slice of cheese and some stale fruit.

I can say in over a thousand flight internationally, this may have been the worst experience in travel in all my years, we will never book EgyptAir, they need to be grounded until they sort these things out and remove these rubbish old men from their planes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/26/2a/c8/c3/tonydel831.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonydel831,Tonydel831 wrote a review Sep 2022,Tonydel831,South Africa,51 contributions,9 helpful votes,Toronto - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r862144386-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Travel cannot get an worse than this - EgyptAir should not be in operation,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was on a vacation with my family consisting of my mother, father and my grandmother. We were on the plane and the doors had closed when my father and I realised something horrific; we forgot the handbag at security check. Unfortunately the plane had already took off, and I had gotten into a panic attack with the staff calming us down especially me, crying hard while my the wonderful stewardess told her they would do everything they can to track the bag down. In the midst of my tears i could hear him say the captain would take matters into their own hands, that reassured me. What also assured me was the measures they told us they’d take and the security services of the airport.
“No one who works here can ever touch an unattended bag, don’t worry we will find it”
I had placed all my faith in God with these words, praying so hard.
The steward and stewardess gave us their numbers so when we land we’d know how to contact them, the security on the plane was on the mission of contacting the head of security in sharm el sheikh airport. After we landed, we were held back a short while for questioning of how the bag looks and its contents. I had them memorised and there were marks that show that it is indeed our bag. We rejoiced when we heard they’d found it and it would be on the next plane to us. I will never forget this experience with EgyptAir and probably might never fly with any agency except there’s. They kept reassuring us and truly helping us calm down and get to the bottom of this. Even checking cameras to see how my father looked and double checking it is indeed him with the bag.
i’ve flown with many agencies before but none have proved this efficient, caring and professional like egyptair did today.

"Starting from the booking the booking was smooth but some important information i cannot find it easily like if i need to amend my flight date do i yhave to pay service fees or it will be free of charge as i booked with the airline directly by it self not through third party companies!!
2- while I’m trying to do online check-in unfortunately I cannot save any changes specially the seat number and when i called the call center unfortunately again they have very poor system which is the staffs using the same system the customers using as well so the agent told me I cannot do any thing from my side as the same message came out for u is the same message came out for me and I don’t have any extra tools to fix it from my side and u have to do it at the airport. I said but i need to choose my seat and now i’m on the last 48hrs before the flight and i can choose it for free he said i cannot do it from my side for free otherwise it will be chargeable . So howcome u have some issues in ur system and when i calling the CC i cannot find any solutions and i have to wait till the flight boarding time to check in then i will find my self sitting in Sandwich!!!

3- During the boarding i have very bad experience with the agent who checked in me.. to be honest i have little bit extra weight and my friend have the same weight but he flew from DXB but me from Sharja.. he passed by his weight but for me he let me pay for extra weight and i asked to talk for some one he let me to talk to some one at least he doesn’t know how to respect the customer as i talking to him and he talking to the agent till I stopped him and notified him that he has to look at me when we are talking together and nothing happened from his side and he said this the rules and we have to follow i said its okay no worries later on i find the supervisor and i informed him about everything he said why u didn’t come for me from the beginning i said i asked about u but they let me to talk to another one I don’t know who he is and nothing happened and I paid then moved on .

4- flight was very delayed and because of that I reached other side and the person who has to pick me up has been left because he has work and i came very late because the delaying from the beginning and to receive the luggage’s as well and what happened that i found my self between the taxi scammers!!!!

5- after landing I waited a lot approximately 45 mins to receive my luggage and i found the wheels has been broken.

6- during my vacation i called the call center again to amend my flight back date he informed me that i have to pay change fees which is i booked directly with Egypt Air to get some features like changing the timing easily with out extra cost except if i will pay for the new date rate .

Finally.. the plane wasn’t clean enough specially the front pocket and the window .

My advise that before u choose Egypt Air take ur time and choose properly.. Egypt Air wasn’t bad but not good specially in the small important details.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AhmedMegahed2022,Ahmed Megahed wrote a review Sep 2022,Ahmed Megahed,,1 contribution,,Sharjah - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r860700545-EGYPTAIR-World.html,No business standard to follow!!

"Flew economy from London Heathrow to Cairo and then Business Class on the return leg.

Enjoyed both flights, check in was no hassle on either occasion and the planes were clean and the staff did their jobs. The business class lounge was quite pleasant at Cairo airport and had a relaxed atmosphere.

Had zero issues with baggage at any stage and the booking process worked fine.

Only slight complaint is that we sat at the terminal for almost an extra hour - which was a pain with everyone boarded and ready to go. We were eventually told there was an issue in the luggage area which was no hassles really - just would have been nice to have been told before 45 minutes had already elapsed!

But other than that small hiccup there were no hassles and given the huge network this airline has I'll probably fly with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/72/d4/a3/paul-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulL148,Paul L wrote a review Sep 2022,Paul L,"Cape Paterson, Australia",729 contributions,339 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r860510828-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Enjoyed both my flights,Date of travel: December 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our bags were missing on arrival on July 2nd, and we’ve been calling and emailing EgyptAir every day but no answer. We were visiting Toronto for 3 weeks and our trip has been ruined due to this incident. We have been informed by the airport claims desk that 2 bags is arriving on 7th July (5 days late), then another 2 bags arrived 10 days late and the last bag arrived 14 days late. This is unbelievable that EgyptAir has never had any empathy concerns to write back to one of the emails and apologize for what happened.

My family and I have suffered from this delay which caused us extra money to purchase all necessities due to this delay and finally, EgyptAir is not accepting any claim for compensation despite providing them all the supporting documents they requested, the reason they said that I am Canadian and traveling to Canada.

I believe that this shall be escalated to IATA and Star Alliance to review such repeating cases with EgyptAir.

My advice to everyone, pay extra money for your convenience, it is worthless to travel with EgyptAir as your plans will get missed, and you will have bad times getting ignored by a careless airline team who doesn't understand the basics of customer service and compensation policies.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/645bassams,Bassam S wrote a review Sep 2022,Bassam S,,1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Cairo - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r859879888-EGYPTAIR-World.html,EgyptAir is the WORST airline EVER!,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Onboard crew were welcoming taking time to explain all the seat and light settings . the flatbed seat configuration was comfortable I did manage to get some sleep though I wish other passengers tried to do the same instead of talking . The meal was very good better than other business class service on other European airlines .

"I have been flying in aeroplanes for 30 years now (flying more that a dozen different airlines in that time). However the recent experience with Egypt Air was the worst of my life (which includes low cost carriers like Spirit Airways, Air Arabia, etc). During my recent vacation in Egypt, I flew with them 3 times. And it was the common experience all the times. First off, the checkin process (if you can call it that) is a mess.              They dont put the correct flight details in the counters at the airport, so finding them is a challenge in itself. And if you ask anyone for help, it is like you are scolding them and they shout back at you (rudeness of the staff is a common theme with them). Then once you board the aircraft, the experience worsens.               The airplanes themselves are in a bad condition. The entertainment systems do not work. To ask this, I pressed the ""Steward help"" button and waited. Nobody turned up for 20 minutes. So I walked up to the attendant and asked her what the problem was. She just rudely asked me to go back to my seat and wait. ""It will work soon"" is what she shouted back. Well it did work, after almost 1 hour that is. And this is on their international route between Cairo and Mumbai.               And this rude behaviour was from all of the staff onboard. The aircraft was almost 45 minutes delayed, and there was no ""Sorry for the inconvenience"".              And when one child sitting next to me spilled some popcorn on the floor, the attendant came and rudely scolded the boy. And she just pushed the popcorn on the floor to under the seat where the child was sitting.Overall this was the last flight I will ever take on this aircraft.

"PLEASE DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE. I cannot state this enough. Please do not. Their flight leaves Nairobi for Cairo everyday at 4.25 am. On July 09, 2022, I arrived at JKIA at 1am, went through check in. The checking officer struggled with her system for a while, but managed to board me for the flight from Nairobi to Cairo which was my connection to Madrid. She did not provide a boarding pass for Cairo to Madrid, her excuse, she couldn't access the systems in Cairo to issue one. BIG RED FLAG! I proceeded to the business lounge. At 3.40am, I stood to go to the gate only to be stopped by the lady at the reception to say that the flight had delayed and would leave at 7am instead. Mad is an understatement. I had no choice, I waited, at 6.30 am, headed to the gate and we boarded. Their business class is not anything close to it. It's economy with bigger seats. They served a glass of fruit juice. At this point, I only wanted to reach Cairo. We arrived and of course the connection flight had left. They said that is such nonchalant way that it's just baffling that they're still in business. They catered for all the costs and we caught our flight the next day to Madrid. Did I add the racism? Since we're black, it meant we couldn't afford business class, right, the boarding officer came around in Cairo looking at us saying that economy class queue was the other one. I, of course, knew why we were being picked out of the crowd. Same old same old. Old aircraft, bad bad (profanity) business class and overall bad service.

"Most people who work for Egyptair really try to help, but a lot are limited by the organization that makes things weird.
The plane out of NBO was delayed by almost 3 hours and most people would miss their connecting flight. The Nairobi staff could not make decisions, but had to wait for Cairo instructions. But Cairo was overwhelmed and didn't react to calls, creating unnecessary angst. Just before departure, most of us got a solution, which we accepted by that time. Arriving in Cairo, the staff from Transfer desk and Customer service were very helpful and put me up at ""le Passage"" for 22 hours. The next day, I took my flight to Brussels. The plane was quite new and I was looking forward to watching a film, after having spent 18 out of the las 22 hours sleeping. I requested earphones, but the staff said that they were unavailable for economy class. How weird is that?

"I have traveled the world with multiple international airlines but this is one of the worst flying experiences I ever had in my life. Everything from getting the boarding pass, to customer care, to taking the flight, to transit at Cairo airport is the worst experience. They are not bothered about passengers.

I am a vegetarian and emailed them to pls arrange for veg meals on flights but nothing was done.

I tried to call the call center in London and no one answered the call for 25 minutes. Finally, I hung up.

I requested the staff issue boarding pass, at the boarding gate and also the hostess inside bit all went on deaf ears. Though the hostess on the other aircraft (Cairo to Dubai) accommodated my request because she was willing to help not like all her other counterparts.

My Flight from London to Cairo was delayed for more than 1 and a half hours and I had a transit flight from Cairo to Dubai. I told this to multiple hostesses on the flight and everyone assured me that it will be taken care of and someone will assist as soon as I land in Cairo. But to my worst nightmare, no one helped. Help is very far no-one was even willing to answer properly. I was on my own running at the airport as only I was bothered that I shud not miss my flight. Noone else. Bad staff bad people, worst airline.

The Check-in gate at London was hell. It took passengers more than an hour to drop off their luggage. What's the point of doing web check in? Their luggage escalators were not working. They put all luggage in front only and it was looking like a fish market. Passengers had trouble even walking there but they were not bothered. Highly untrained and non-empathic staff.

The same thing happened at boarding gates. Passengers were treated like a herd of cattle. Kids are crying but they are not bothered. This is the only airline in the world I have seen who doesn't let families with kids go first inside the aircraft.
Poor parents gave to be in queue with crying kids.

Lastly, they missed my luggage in Cairo during transit. How careless an Airline can be? I didn't receive my luggage at the belt and was delivered 2nd day despite a promise of same-day delivery. Honestly, they were not bothered. I didnt get any help from anyone at any step. Even D-nata is not bothered

All in all, I will never recommend this airline to any traveler unless it is absolutely necessary.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayank831,Mayank G wrote a review Jun 2022,Mayank G,"New Delhi, India",60 contributions,24 helpful votes,London - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r844501900-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst airline in world,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very rude customer service, the worst I have ever encountered. They gave me and my friend lot of suffering.

We had valid entry to Canada and they denied us boarding during transit in Cairo. They didn't like us from the start and made up lot of excuses to the Canadian authorities why we shoukdnt boars. The story is long...

We were treated like trash and ignored and left in the airport for a long 60 hours. They didn't refund us either and we had to fly back on our behalf.

"This is by far the worst airline I jave traveled on and I have been to a few countries. The air hostesses are rude and act as though they are doing paying customers a favor. Yet people pay lots of money to be on this airline. I recall a flight attendant rolling her eyes at a passenger and there is just no way of speaking. The staff on Egypt seriously need more customer service training and how to approach people. On the return flight home a male flight attendant was so arrogant to a passenger and it got pretty intense. To get through to this airline is a challenge as I am struggling to get a refund after hours of a delay in Cairo and no re issue of a connecting flight back once I landed in Johannesburg. Yet I was promised a refund should I purchase a flight on my own. It's a pity that this is one of the only airlines to Travel to such a beautiful place but I will never ever recommend air Egypt to anyone. The food, the service and the online response are pathetic.

"Flew from LHR to Nairobi. Flight late in departing, missed connection in Cairo (also Egyptair). Re routed via Ethiopia. Total delay 10 hours. Egyptair refused to pay compensation because ""LHR was busy"", so no slots availible. Looking at flight history, this flight had the same issue 13 times, in the previous 14 days... But apparently not Egyptair's problem.

7 Hour delay on the return trip... No compensation from Egypt air because they are not regustered in the EU....Similarory... same delays 13 times out of 14 days in the fortnight...

"Solo female traveller. I had an Easter holiday trip all booked from Abu Dhabi to Cairo, round trip tour from Cairo and then stopping off in Sharm El Shekh for a week with return flight from SS to AD.

Went to check in at AD airport to be told that check in had closed despite the people in front of me still checking in and it not yet being the given time for last checkin. I tried to make this clear to staff and was told no. I ended up having to book with a different airline.

Internal flight from Cairo to SS was fine, but unexpected stop at Hurgadha which then confused my pick up people who were left waiting at SS airport for two hours wondering where I was. No notification and no announcements made prior to checking in.

When going to take return flight from SS, I arrived at airport to be told that airline has cancelled my flight. Was given no warning but reason given was that I was ‘no show’ at AD airport on outward journey. Didn’t get told anything or sent any notification that return journey had subsequently been cancelled. I was left at SS airport alone, with no access to cards to book a flight again online (verifications needed by AD phone number) and two smiling check in attendants asking for my cards to rebook the flight without explaining first the situation with what I had already booked.

I booked a single flight from SS to Cairo so that I could arrange for someone to help me further when I got there. The treatment at Cairo airport was appalling. No help offered, people shoving past me, two security guards hassling me for my boarding passes and taking passport off me and holding for long periods numerous times in the interest of ‘checks’.

In the end I booked with airarabia but such a shame as the rest of my visit to Egypt had been fantastic and had felt safe as a solo traveller.

"I had 4 trips with Egyptair
Amsterdam - Cairo
Cairo - Luxor
Aswan - Cairo
Cairo - Amsterdam

On the first trip they explained de emergency door to everyone expect to me (a women) THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD FOR EVERYONE who would need my assistance during an emergency.

When we asked the vegetarian meal they told us; just take the chicken and throw the meat of.

The toilet was disgusting everything wet of water I hoped, but the smell told me otherwise.
After cleaning the nessecerry part to releave myself I thought how upset I would be if this plain would be my investment. Piss walked all over the carpet of your plain and the health hazard for people/children on-board.

The other flight was no different only that it left very late. They started boarding and busses were already bringen people to the plain just to bring them all back again after 15 min. due to technical failure of the plane so the told us. Well that felt like a comfortable thought. We think an could see something else going on but I don't want to go there because it is more speculation than fact on my part.

Iside note
n Aswan some guy from customs was standing before the toilets and whispered money money just before I walked in showing some bills he was holding in his hand. I know this is not allowed so I pulled up an eyebrow and asked him a bit to loud money?!?! he then replied no toilet mam toilet en left.
Will be sending

"I would like to inform you that we are totally disappointed with the service received from Egyptair in Bahrain. We were scheduled to be on the flight from Bahrain-Cairo-Johannesburg last night MS921 but we denied access because of a PCR test. We explained to the guy that South Africa required either a PCR test of proof of vaccination which we have but he refused to board us. We tried for hours to contact egyptair offices without luck so we are stranded in Bahrain as a result.

Nobody responded to assist us to get on the next flight out because we had business meetings in South Africa that we missed as a result of this mess up. I really don't know who Egyptair employs. The people at the business class counter by the airport are useless and could not assist. After an amazing journey to Bahrain I am saddened by this experience and lack of assistance.

"I don't usually write reviews, but I think I have to warn people about the awful customer service they will experience if they fly Egypt Air. I recently flew with Egypt air during a trip with family. We were meant to have five flights: one from the US to Cairo, two from Luxor to Amman, and two to get us back to the US. Before our trip, we were notified that the second flight from Luxor to Amman had been cancelled, and we had been rebooked for a flight five hours later. Because it was a connecting flight, this meant we had a layover five hours longer than we had planned. We were given no reason why our flight had been cancelled, no apology for the change, and no compensation offer. While this was frustrating as it changed our travel plans, we did not complain. However, in the middle of our trip, we were notified that the first of our flights back to the US had been cancelled, and we were rebooked for a different flight 2 DAYS later. Note that the second, connecting flight, was still booked for the original date and egypt air had not changed that. Again, there was no explanation, apology, or compensation. After hours (of vacation time) spent on the phone with and in the offices of Egypt air, we learned that both our cancelled flights were cancelled simply because they were not fully booked. Egypt air said the only thing they could do was refund the cost of the flight that we had not yet used (the return flight). This could not possibly cover us booking flights with a different airline for our original date, as this happened only a week before we were flying and all flights were more expensive at that point. Egypt air refused to provide housing for us or rebook us on another carrier. I’m not sure how they expected us to make our connecting flight that was still for the original date. In addition to all of this, at the airport, we approached an Egypt air help desk to ask about our flights and try to get compensation. After being ignored for several minutes by 6 agents not doing any other work, we were finally helped. However, in the middle of us talking, the agent took a cell phone call and ignored us again. Finally, we were told they could not help us at that desk, the only desk that we could be helped at was outside the terminal (which we couldn’t get to), but they couldn’t do anything anyway so not to bother. Overall, this was by far the worst flying experience any of us have ever had. Horrendous customer service. Egypt air has guaranteed that none of us will ever be flying with them again, and I urge anyone else who wants even a halfway decent flying experience to avoid Egypt air at all cost.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8233SUclare,Clare wrote a review Jun 2022,Clare,,1 contribution,,Washington DC - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r841174761-EGYPTAIR-World.html,The worst flying experience I've ever had,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I rarely write reviews, especially negative ones, but this review needed to be written. EgyptAir is the absolute worst airline I have ever experienced. Staff that absolutely don’t care about travelers. I’m absolutely disgusted by the way I was treated. I had a flight from Luxor to Alexandria via Cairo. I showed the attendant my boarding passes while checking in my bags. He told me that the boarding passes were no longer relevant because the flight changed. Without any explanation of what actually changed. Then he gave me boarding passes to Cairo only, and marked my luggage to arrive in Cairo. I stopped him and tried to explain that I’m going to Alexandria. He corrected me and said that I’m mistaken. That my flight was only to Cairo. I explained that I have proof I have two legs on EgyptAir from Luxor to Cairo and then from Cairo to Luxor. He insisted that I was wrong, despite the ticket I presented. Then another attendant started searching for my ticket at the next counter over after seeing how frustrated I was. New information emerged. My flight from Cairo to Alexandria was apparently canceled and I had supposedly received an email. No email was received. The attendant then proceeded to explain that I needed to stop in Cairo, pick up my luggage and then file a complaint. No attempt to book me on an alternative flight was made or secure accommodations for me. I’ll be landing at night, around 9pm. I don’t live in Cairo, and don’t have a hotel reservation there. I argued that this isn’t how airlines should handle cancelations. I asked to speak to a manager, and Mr Kamal Mohammad Ahmed (my attempt at reading the scribbled name he gave on a torn piece of paper), the first attendant, ridiculed me by saying he’s the manager and that there is nothing further to discuss. Just like those comedy shows where everyone is the manager. I picked up my boarding pass to Cairo and walked away. I felt humiliated. I felt ashamed to be an Egyptian. I felt disgusted by the staff at EgyptAir. So much for Egyptian hospitality. I plan to drive from Cairo to Alexandria. I will be making no attempts at booking another flight with them. In any event, be careful when booking and safe travels!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmattar1981,kmattar1981 wrote a review Jun 2022,kmattar1981,"San Francisco, California",3 contributions,,Luxor - Alexandria,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r841024166-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Avoid EgyptAir at All Cost,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"For my vacation to Egypt I flew Egypt Air from Johannesburg to Cairo, Cairo to Aswan, Hurghada to Cairo, and Cairo back to Johannesburg. Great experience on all FOUR of my flights. Leading up to my trip, I’d read terrible reviews about Egypt Air- people had lost luggage, damaged luggage, delayed flights, unpleasant staff experiences… I experienced NONE of those things.

My bags, which I checked through on every flight, were never lost. Damage to the bags was minimal. Staff at check in and even on the flights was friendly and helpful. Only on one of my flights was there a flight attendant who wasn’t as helpful as the others. All of my flights arrived and landed on time. The planes were perfectly fine.

"The staff at check in were very nice, easygoing, accommodating and engaging. They were the friendliest and most genuinely spirited check in people I have ever worked with.

The easy onboarding was managed smoothly.
Efficient staff
Water was offered a few times
Restrooms were kept clean during flight
Seats comfortable enough for a ten hour flight
Food OK. Bland but enough for a meal
Stewards don’t all understand English. Can’t object to that. This is not an American airline.
Seats in the 40’s not over the wing so you can see more

Entertainment system a little funky. Touch screens didn’t always respond. Navigation could be more intuitive. There is not a great range of movies. Enjoyed West Side Story.

Plane arrived within 30 minutes of ETA.

I easily bought a oneway way ticket $551 USD purchased the day before flight. All seat selections had some price, but not exhorbitant. $15 for a window seat.

I had to reload website a few times to get it to work. The date function on the first screen does not always work.

The day of the flight the website stated that they do not have updates on departure time. That is an easy to develop and useful function for flyers.

Overall a good experience in contrast to what I expected from all the negative reviews.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/7f/avatar066.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grumo,Grumo wrote a review May 2022,Grumo,"New York City, New York",833 contributions,174 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r840292660-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Pleasantly surprised/ better than I had expected,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They stole my luggage and claimed it was lost. How do you lose a luggage if it's on the same plane you're traveling on? Rude customer service and flight attendants. Food was nasty and not fresh.

"Absolutely terrible. Worst 10h 20 mins of my life. I asked for water several times for 2 hours straight, I felt like I was gonna faint. They kept telling me they were coming back and never came back. Don't get me started on the bacteria, stains and dirt everywhere. I had to clean everything myself. The flight attendants always seemed like they hated their job, except for one of the male flight attendant. Food was fine but if I didn't have an eyelash in my cheesecake I would give the food 4 stars, but it made me want to puke. Seats were obviously so small no space anywhere. Some movies and music to watch and listen. There's no wifi on the plane. I appreciated the packets they gave that had socks, wipes, toothbrush and sanitiser, but thats about it. The pilot freaking landed so bad, it felt like it had crashed, everyone was off balance. Now, arriving to the airport was just confusing, there were such vague signs of where to go for what. I needed my visa and I did not know where to go, the visa sign was what seemed like 1,000 steps away from where the actual place to get your visa was. We got there at 5 am they took 2 hours till they brought back my luggages, everyone was waiting for so long, some were still there after I got my luggages. Again no wifi in the airport. To give you advice, please improve your airline, stop neglecting travellers because you are not only losing customers, but you're making Egypt look bad.

"I took an 11 hour non-stop flight from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York to Cairo International Airport, and then back from Cairo to JFK almost a week later. Never have I had such an utterly miserable experience with an airline as this one.

I tried to call to help schedule my flight and then to confirm it. They never answered their phones either time. The flight times of both the departure and the return trip were changed without me being notified. I was not wearing a mask when boarding the departure due to the United States mask requirement for public transit no longer being in effect, but I was not allowed to board the flight without a mask and was told by an airline worker at the gate that masks were mandatory. ""It will be better for you,"" he said to me, quite obnoxiously. However, on the flight, several flight attendants were not wearing masks. I eventually took my mask off, along with more than half of the other passengers, and nobody said anything. The flight departed for Cairo 90 minutes late. No explanation was given to the passengers.

The return flight was also terrible. A relative of mine called to confirm the departure time. Unlike me, he managed to get through and speak to someone on the phone. However, the person refused to verify the departure time unless the call came within 24 hours of departure. That does not make any sense to me. On the flight itself, the cabin was very warm and we were given an insufficient amount of water. I was told to close my window almost immediately after takeoff. That was ridiculous. It was a day time flight and hardly anybody was trying to sleep. If someone elsewhere on the plane was trying to sleep, they would probably have been able to do so simply with the lights of the plane turned off. I opened the window a crack so that I could read and then was told to close it, again, even though hardly anyone anywhere on the plane was attempting to sleep. I was later told to open the window before arrival. For what reason, I wonder? There were children on the flight playing a computer game without earbuds and with the volume turned on. Several flight attendants walked right by it and did nothing. It wasn't until another passenger got up to complain that something was finally done about it. Me having a window open a crack to read was a problem, but this wasn't, apparently. The flight took off about half an hour late, but was somehow still early. On both flights, announcements were made in Arabic and English. This ought to be expected, as I was travelling between an English-speaking country and an Arabic-speaking country. However, for some reason, there was one announcement made on the return flight which was made only in Arabic.

These people don't care about their customers. They are terrible. Only fly EgyptAir if there are absolutely no other choices.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E453UOwilliamp,William P wrote a review May 2022,William P,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r838853991-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Two-way 11 hour flight between New York and Cairo,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I traveled Business Class to and from Dubai with layovers. This airline is totally inconsistent. From food to service to cleanliness. Some planes required masks others didn’t.

"Let me start by saying you definitely do not care about your travellers and definitely not about customer service.

I had been travelling with EgyptAir several times and every time something goes wrong, but this last trip was just the deciding factor to avoid your Airline as much as possible and try to let people know about it.

On Friday, 6th May I had a flight booked from Hurgada to Cairo ( MS 049, scheduled for 20.40 ) and then to Duba ( MS 910, scheduled for 22:45 ).

Because of the delay of the first flight from Hurghada to Cairo, we have arrived in Cairo a delay and after waiting for customs to actually appear on yet another security check to enter International Departures, running to the F5 gate, and actually arrived there to find your staff laughing at me that Aiport doors are closed and I need to wait for another flight, which was scheduled to 5.35 in the morning hours of 7th May.

Of course, they have sent me to the wrong information desk and after finally reaching the Customer information desk on the level below, a very rude employee shouted at me that I am not entitled to anything not even a basic voucher for food or drink like it was my fault that I missed the flight. All of the people seating there doing nothing just being on their mobile phones were willing to do anything about it. He said I need to get to Immigration to get my stamp cancelled and leave the International space to go talk to the Customer Centre of Egypt Air in the outside office of Terminal.

After the heated argument, I got my new boarding ticket and headed to the Lounge where I paid 40$ for the worst service and selection of food and drinks possible. Internet speed was the only good thing.
To my surprise there was a couple coming on the same flight from Hurghada, they did not pay for the lounge, they got complimentary food from outlets outside Lounge, and they were fluent in Arabic.

Boarding the morning flight was OK and after coming to Dubai, of course, my luggage was not on the flight, DNATA services ( DXBMS95140 ) could not even trace it and advised me to wait for the next flight in the afternoon. Of course, again, the luggage was not there and only got information that my luggage came with the flight on Sunday morning, I finally received my luggage on 8th May at 23.15.

Definitely, I was treated as bad as possible, your airport staff do not even have basic English knowledge or any kind of customer service skill, definitely would make a difference if I would speak Egypt Arabic but at International Terminal you should have people with some common sense to at least pretend to be nice.

EgyptAir does not care and I am avoiding it in future definitely.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133matejk,Matej K wrote a review May 2022,Matej K,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Cairo - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r837797161-EGYPTAIR-World.html,They do not care and do not even try,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I arrived at Cairo Airport on 4th May at 1300 hrs for our flight at 16.35. After arriving at the head of the security queue, before being even allowed to get to check-in, we were told by the police our flight had been cancelled and to go to Customer Service at the far end of the concourse. After queueing there for about 15 mins we eventually got to the head of the queue to be told the flight wasn't cancelled but was delayed to 0300. No explanation was given. After waiting a further 40 mins, we were told we would be taken to a nearby hotel and to return at midnight. We were  bussed to a Novotel and allocated a basic room where the tv didn't work. We were told someone would come to see to it when they were less busy. No one came. At midnight we took the shuttle bus back to the airport. Exactly the same happened again, ending up at Customer Services after being sent there by the police. Again we could not get any explanation for what was happening. Eventually we were told the flight would go ahead at 0500 that day (5th May). At that point we were told the police would let us through, but even then confusion reigned until the police got the message and we proceeded through to check-in. As 0500 neared we were informed our flight was delayed yet again to 0600. We were allowed onto the plane at 0530; but did not take off until 0700. This was a total of 19 hours from first arriving at Cairo Airport until take-off. When we got home I complained to EgyptAir: their ""Care Team"" apologised, but still gave no explanation and offered a discount of 30% off my next international flight within 12 months. As this was intended to be our last long-haul flight due to age, health and other reasons, I said that the offer, though appreciated, could not be accepted and asked for some monetary compensation. This was refused.

"I flew from Johannesburg South Africa to the Netherlands with my transit being in Cairo Egypt.
The flight was fine, food was not good at all, raisins in lasagna and unflavoured chicken with rice isn't really my thing, however that I could handle.

Upon arrival at my final destination (Amsterdam) I waited 1. 5hours at the baggage belts( the only on left from the flight) awaiting my luggage, my suitcase NEVER arrived!
I reported the ""delayed"" luggage immediately and was told it would be delivered to my home address within 1-2 days.

After 3 days, I checked the Worldwide tracker, where details of your luggage was loaded on and you can see if there has been anything found, still nothing... keeping in mind that literally all of my clothes, toiletries and sentimental stuff and camera is in the bag! PANIC! I did relocate to the Netherlands so pretty much everything I needed was in there!

I called and sent emails regularly, the only response is wait until 21 days and keep invoices of items bought so I can be compensated later... people at the airport in Amsterdam had told me that the chances of finding my luggage decrease as the days go by (we're at day 12 at this point) how does this airline expect you to magically catch money from the sky to go on shopping sprees for underwear, work clothes, shoes and make-up???

Like, I'm baffled!

I'm all the rage for cheap flights, but WOW! I will definitely throw the coin going forward.

Yes! This could happen to any airline but atleast have some dignity about it, show EMPATHY and try to be a responsible airline.

It's been 12 days, and nothing! If anyone has experienced this with this useless and embarrassing airline please let me know! Or if you have an idea of what I can do next please feel free to email me at; que.anissa30@gmail.com.

Please spend the extra cash on an airline that will help you when they actually mess things up and not sit back and make it look like its normal for your valuables to go missing when its within their control.

"On Sunday 27th of March I had a flight from Cairo Airport to Barcelona  The initial flight MS767 was supposed to depart at 11.05 am but after waiting 1.5 hours , departure and then going back to the airport the craft was landed again due to technical reasons. To sum up the flight was delayed in total 5,3 hours that meant we left at 16.30 pm instead of 11.0 am.The problem with this is that I had a connecting flight from Barcelona to Alicante (Spain) which of course I lost because of the 5,3 hours delay.                                 Because of this I had to stay 1 night in Barcelona and incur in additional expenses such as accommodation, dinner and another means of transport to go to Alicante the next day.There was nobody at the airport representing the company to even ask if we needed any assistance, what would happen to passengers who had other connecting flights, it was 21.00 pm and there was no other flights, buses or trains and I had to organize that night in Barcelona all by myself and apart from that I had to take one day leave from work and as I said with no one at the airport or in the plane asking if we needed any assistance because of the 5,3 hours delay.I have been writing to customer service ever since but after just one apology and lame excuse they did nothing and have not responding to my emails ever since.They just dont care",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlinaT633,Alina T wrote a review Apr 2022,Alina T,,1 contribution,,Cairo - Barcelona,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r836508695-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Terrible experience,Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After a 2 year break we decided to go back to luxor, boy wish we had not.
Firstly check in at Heathrow was a joke even for business class passengers.
Plane was no time for a change.
As I said we were in business class nothing special wasted off money in fact only one bottle of water given out one one coke I asked for food was OK entertainment very poor one of the smallest TV screen I have seen needs updating.
As for the crew well I have never meet a more miserable crew than this the lady was miserable the whole flight not even a goodbye when leaving the plane.
But worse was to come they lost our luggage no one was interested in trying to find it after we reported it to egyptair handling team at luxor and they lied all week to ask saying its in Heathrow and its coming tomorrow and so on 3 week since we have been home and guess what still no luggage just lies from egyptair about who as it joke airline so be warned if you use egyptair customer service is very very very important to them but they all need retaining big time because once they have your money they don't give a toss about you.
They completely ruined our holiday for me and my wife have to go around charity shop for some clothes for the week.

"On 10/04/2022 I was travelling from Erbil airport to London Heathrow via Cairo.
Just before boarding at Erbil airport I was pointed by one of their Iraqi male staff from a distance to wear cover mask, I replied I do not have any. Then he asked me to go and get one from the cafe which was close by the gate. I went there and I was told 1000 IQ dinar for one which I paid for.
When I went back to the gate I told the staff members that you as airline must provide your passengers face mask like every other airlines not just tell people to go and buy before boarding.
Then to cover up their mistake the staff all went quiet , only Iraqi staff started giving excuses that sorry they should have given you one from checking disk and I have one I could have five you.!!! he did not know how to cover it up.
I said if you have one then why did you ask me to go and pay for it? then he just went quiet.
He misguides people to spend money to buy facemask instead of providing the passengers facemask form the desk or before boarding.

"I recently flew EgyptAir from Dubai to Canada via Cairo. My experience with them has been stressful/ traumatic at best.
During the 1st leg of the trip, at Dubai airport, Egyptair check-in staff (they're from an outsourced company called Dnata) took my phone to verify my COVID vaccination proof and ArriveCan forms and never bothered to return it. As the phone was not in my line of sight, after a bit of back and forth with the woman on my trip and baggage info, I forgot to ask her to hand me my phone back. I then proceeded to Security check, immediately realized I don't have my phone on me. This was like within 10 minutes from when I left the check-in desk in Terminal 1, Area-2. I requested to talk to the police, hoping who may be able to escort me out back to check-in desk to retrieve my phone. But the security woman on duty was downright rude, and yelled at me asking me to go to the boarding gate and then report it at Lost & Found (you have to take a train to get there. Very far way from the check-in desk). At this point, I knew this was getting nowehere.
Without a choice, I hopped on the train, proceeded to boarding gates, located Lost & Found and reported there. They called some numbers and said there's no phone found anywhere. I took the L&F person's number and kept it touch with him from my business cell phone (luckily I was carrying it). I had an hour to board at that point of time, and hoped I may get it back.
When the EgyptAir staff got to the boarding gate half hour prior to boarding time, I let them know the situation. Again, nobody tried to help. They just said the check-in desk is closed and they don't know how to follow-up on this. Also, I was told they'd check Vaccine proof and ArriveCan again in Cairo, so it is not a good idea to travel without them there. I did have a copy of those on my business phone, though no hard-copies.
Long story short, Lost & Found updated me that nobody handed over such a phone to them, and EgyptAir has no idea about these check-in staff as they're from an outsourced company called Dnata. Their staff seemed inexperienced from the way they were conducting business. Probably experienced workers were replaced with newbies for cost savings.

Moral of the story: Please do not rely on your mobile device for important travel documents.
Even if it's a momentary slip on your part, when something valuable is lost at Dubai airport, no one - Airport staff, EgyptAir, Check-in staff - will do their part to help you with the situation. You'd be stuck in a limbo in places like Cairo where there's no free wi-fi (sms passcode was never sent to an international number) or an option to pay for wifi, if you don't readily have Vaccine Proof, PCR and other covid related documents. The officials may treat you with suspicion if you tell them you lost your phone with these myriad forms, rather than trying to help you.

Be extremely careful with your belongings including gadgets and travel documents at Dubai Airport. You'd be in for unpleasant surprises once things get lost.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781techm,Tech M wrote a review Apr 2022,Tech M,,2 contributions,,Dubai - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r834177423-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Phone lost at EgyptAir check-in desk in DXB,Date of travel: April 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My family and I booked tickets for travel in the summer of 2020 with Egypt air through expedia.  Due to covid restrictions Egypt air cancelled our flights . We were are given 12 month to use them. However we were still in restriction and even Egypt air said they would give an extension for travel around this period.I have tried to chase up a refund or even an opportunity to use the coupons and Egypt has not responded to any of my emails. Expedia says its up to Egypt air to decide.  Those tickets cost us almost £2000. I cannot believe they think its okay to keep our money in such circumstances. I would not recommend anyone using this airline.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655helenaj,Helena J wrote a review Apr 2022,Helena J,,1 contribution,,Berlin - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r833791621-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Refund policy,Date of travel: April 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The customer service is horrible! This is the worst airline ever. Buyer beware. Our flight was cancelled after waiting for 4 hrs then they told it it was not cancelled but rather a delay (which will last over 24hrs) due to a missing piece for the plane. The piece will be flown in from Egypt. Many had connecting flights and others no longer feel comfortable on the airline. The airline refused to allow passengers to get their bags. Over 300 people left at the airport until 2am as the managers scurried to try to find hotel accommodations (which they only found for half the passengers). They had papers of people writing their phone numbers and said they’ll contact passengers with a time to return to the airport. Other customers rummaged through the boarding passes of passengers who finally went home and some added their names to lists that they have no idea what the list was for. There was Poot communication and no end to this nightmare.  They are not sure when or if the flight will actually take off after 24 hrs but still refuse to release the baggage to customers. They are not offering refunds. The scene at JFK airport was chaotic and unprofessional. PLEASE DO NOT FLY EGYPTAIR!!

"Booked EGYPT AIR via edreams website. What a shambles edreams are, for the following reasons:
Never informed me my second leg CAIRO-ABUDHABI had been canx. I found out by mistake from EGYPT AIR. When I confronted edreams about canx flight, they had no idea, in fact I understand EGYPTAIR had canx this section of flight BEFORE I had made my booking!! On their website my booking was still CONFIRMED!!!. When I asked edreams to change my date of flights, due to canx of my booking, they offered me flight times CAIRO-AUH before flight time of LCA-CAIRO!!! and wanted to charge an exorbitant fee, saying it was EGYPTAIR that was charging this fee. In fact EGYPT AIR had no fee since they had canx the flight. In the end, I canx both legs of journey with edreams and they took a sizeable chunk of my booking cost, which they say will be refunded in SIX MONTHS TIME. What a con company.
Then I wanted to canx my edreams PRIME SUBSCRIPTION before the trial period had ended so they would not charge my credit card a renewal fee. Again the chat people were a discrace.

"After booking a flight with Egypt Air and THEN reading the reviews I had braced myself for something dismal.

In fact I had a lovely flight with kind and attentive staff, a good meal and drinks, easy check in and a clean and well organised plane.

The only thing I would mention is the seat rests don't stay up as they are too big to fit between seats and I like space 😂

Other than that I couldn't fault them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melonies505,Melonie S wrote a review Feb 2022,Melonie S,,1 contribution,,London - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r828022529-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Easy flight, lovely staff",Date of travel: February 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew them as I had no choice!  Believe me I would not have bothered otherwise.  Direct flight to Cairo easiest option.  Cheap.  Staff were very unfriendly and rude.  Really poor customer service.  Planes were very basic.  I was not expecting anything five star anyway.  Reasonably clean.  Food was awful and bland.  Thrown at you.  If you did not make eye contact with the staff, you may not get a meal as they assume you don't want it!  Might be a good thing as it was awful!  Limited choice of drinks including very sweet juice.  Limited in-flight entertainment.  Leg room was not great and seats were tight.  Thank god, as I had a seat by the window, the middle seat was empty and then there was a gentleman on the isle seat who decided to pick his nose the entire flight!  On my return flight where I had to change with no choice from Luxor to Cairo and then to London, the flight was delayed which meant I missed my connection and ended up landing in London nearly ten hours later!  Annoying.  The only good thing they did was put me and the other people in a nice hotel in Cairo Airport with a free meal.  This was the only well managed part!  To be honest, I would have rather been home earlier.  If you are desperate as I said and want a direct quick flight to Egypt.  Flight time from the UK to Egypt is short so this was fine.  I would not do a long flight with them.  They also have a bad safety record and planes are quite old which made me nervous.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liveandsee23,Abovetheclouds wrote a review Feb 2022,Abovetheclouds,,1492 contributions,407 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r827863780-EGYPTAIR-World.html,If you are really desperate and want a direct flight to Egypt!,Date of travel: December 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm back and forth between 3 and 4 stars here. I was concerned when I read prior reviews but glad to say my experience was better than the consensus. I did not have to deal with customer service because I was on a tour so can't speak on that. I can say that check-in at JFK airport was friendly and reasonable. Though when I showed the agent the QR code for covid negative test she asked if I had something written out. In Egypt as well they saw the QR code and ignored it (bring some written proof of test date!). Food was good both ways, not great. Flight crew was friendly, when they were available. The in-flight entertainment was outdated. Hopefully you can sleep on your overnight, lack of legroom made that difficult. In flight they turn off the seat belt much earlier than usual flights.

"This is a review focused only on the Customer Service.

I booked by trip from Toronto to Jeddah (with a layover in Cairo), scheduled to depart on Feb. 4th., 2022. After talking to the airline and getting a confirmation quite confidently that I don't have to quarantine in Saudi Arabia after arriving. Behold, after I contacted the Saudi Visa center, they confirmed that I indeed have to quarantine because of the layover in Cairo. It's almost impossible to get hold of someone in the customer service department and after getting touch with them, they're very inflexible for either refund or adjustment.

I don't care how decent their food or flight service is, I could have been potentially stuck in Saudi Arabia and would have to figure out how to leave the country to go somewhere else due to quarantine requirements. I'm not even sure how this airline is still in business.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/470muhammadw,Muhammad W wrote a review Jan 2022,Muhammad W,"Toronto, Canada",8 contributions,1 helpful vote,Toronto - Jeddah,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r826129793-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Hoorendous customer service,Date of travel: January 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I’ve been traveling Egypt air for almost 37 years and have had the worst experience. I have always tolerated them because it’s a direct flight to Cairo and since I’m Egyptian, I travel a lot! However, this last trip was the last straw. They have no compassion and treat customers horrible. Even though I’ve been a loyal customer all these years, they still did not care and did try to help me and my family. I was traveling with 2 small children and they didn’t care to help me and treated me very badly. My story is a long one to get into but my point is simple, DO NOT FLY EGYPTAIR!!!! It’s not worth the money or time.

Horrid horrid airline. The flight crew is very curt and not at all friendly so don't expect decent customer service. They do not and will not enforce their own mask policy. You can't get in touch with customer service. They lost our luggage and didn't notify us at all. We had to go back and forth to the airport in Lagos 3 times as our luggage trickled in without so much as an email from Egyptair. Many members of their own flight crew didn't adhere to Dulles Airports mask policy and walked through the airport maskless.

"Everyone has that ONE place that always wanted to go. Place they dreamed about their entire life. Egypt was that place for me. Seeing the pyramids , swimming in the Nile, my childhood dreams, finally were about to become reality. JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME I told my friends. As they sighed in envy wishing they could join. Everyone wanted “ton of pictures and videos “ and of course a piece from the Grand Pyramid. As I started searching for airline options, Egypt Air seemed to be the perfect fit. Direct flight out of JFK. I get to experience the culture and the language even on the plane. It is part of Star Alliance, which meant I can use some of my 1.3 MILLION miles to upgrade! Is googled the number and called the NY office immediately. After waiting on hold for 2.5 hours finally someone answered. I asked her how so can purchase a ticket and use my miles to upgrade. She told me the steps, I paid $2400 dollars for an upgradable Economy ticket , got my confirmation number and hang up. I then called United Airlines to upgrade. Entire process took less then 10 minutes. I am done ! Well, so I thought.

Fast forward to September , original tickets were purchased in July for December 26th departure, I call Egypt Air back. I am trying to confirm my flight and pick seats but the system will not let me. Same person from the first time answered the phone after another 1 hour and 45 minutes wait. By the way , I am pretty sure she is the ONLY person who works in that office. She said “ I do not see your reservation at all. Must have been canceled. “ After my heart skipped couple of beats, I asked .. How could that be possible ? She blamed UNITED and told me not to worry! We just have to repeat the same process all over one more time. So we do …. Nope. It’s not over ! December comes and I want confirm my ticket and my reservation one more time. YES. You are right ! System once again lost my entire reservation after multiple e mails from Egypt air confirming flight and upgrade. Now I am in complete panic mode. I am literally supposed to fly in 10 days !

Does anyone want to guess her response ? If you are thinking she is about to say “ Don’t worry we just have to repeat the process one more time “ you are CORRECT but there is a caveat, they no longer have upgradable seats. I have to fly Economy… I ask for a manager , who seemed to be on vacation repeatedly every other day , he gets on the phone and says I need to contact the main office in Cairo. They very next day, he forwards me an e mail from Cairo stating there is NOTHING they can do because it’s a system issue. I called him back as soon as I finished reading the e mail, no response. So call the main office back to ask for him and the same person told me he was on vacation AGAIN !! His system must have automatically forwarded the e mail. Who knows considering how terrible their entire system seems to be. Finally I call United. They take over the issue and fix it. It’s December 26. It’s THE DAY. I arrived at the airport with incredible excitement having forgotten about all the countless problems. I go through the line , get to the gate and there is a 2 hour delay. OK. Fine no big deal right ? We are all used to airport delays.. I am not going to let a minor delay ruin my dream vacation !! NO WAY. Remember, UNITED fixed the issue got me a window seat in Business class from the very front of the cabin .. REMEMBER? Well my assigned seat was a middle seat , next to new born baby and the very last possible row in the business class. As I started to wonder, is this a message from above ? Is GOD telling me NOT to go on this journey ? I see bunch of flight attendants and supervisor , obvious from the way they were dressed, I run over there to explain my dilemma. Frustration and at this point pure anger obvious from my behavior and attitude , one of them says. “ Do not worry , I will get someone for you”. Boarding process ends. Cabin door locks. No one shows up. This might have been the only vacation I have ever started crying in disappointment. Disappointment in how an airline representing EGYT , a bucket list destination for many around the world , can so clueless and careless about WHAT THIS VACATION MEANS. Not JUST for me but for millions who visit ? How can they not understand THEY set the tone for what is to come ? How can they be so indifferent to a nightmare they created ?

So dear friends, my journey of a lifetime unfortunately became the biggest nightmare I have ever had in 20 years of travel.

Take my advice. Find ANY OTHER WAY to get to Egypt. At least they won’t be able to ruin your dreams.

By the way , 11 hour flight , they had NO WI-FI service and brought out plastic utensils in Business class. I know I could not believe it either so I took pictures.

One of the worst flights I’ve taken during covid. My flight was Jan 2022 during the fast spread of Omicron. So many passengers unmasked during the flight or even masks down below the nose and stewardess just walking by without asking them to follow the mask policy. Many people coughing the whole flight still not masking. 1 stewardess was without a mask the whole flight himself. DO NOT FLY EGYPTAIR! unless you wanna risk getting Covid.

As dbl check I called egypt air who told me first leg LCA-CAIRO had been canx in NOVEMBER 21!!! but we were still on flights CAIRO-ABUDHABI!!!. I communicated, via chat with edreams who cfm first leg had been canx. I inquired why we were not notified and given alternative dates. Responce from edreams, you can change flight dates for a fee of 240euro!!!! or canx your flights and get a refund of 612.60 in 180days. Wow why should i pay for a flight that EGYPT AIR CANX and i had paid 693.65!! Plus i pad extra to become prime member (in my opinion a rip off). I asked for full refund, chat host sorry only can compensate you 612.60 in 180days because u are canx your itenary. I asked three times what the extra 240e was for and was told EGYPT AIR was charging this for your change of itenary!!! I asked about 4 times what were the new flight dates suggested and i was told ""24APRIL"" original booking was for 23MAR. Host, sorry i meant MAR. Iasked for more details and i got
24MAR CAIAUH 0905 1410
Then 24MAR LCACAI 1910 2035.
I pointed out this was stupid, my second leg of the journey was before the first leg!!! Host u can canx the flights and get 612.60 in 180 days!!!! no refund on the prime subscription.
In my opinion EDREAMS are professional con group taking advantage of the misfortune of pax that book through them. When i booked, money was taken from my visa card the same day, they want 180days to return canx booking which was not my fault, also they keep the prime subscription money as part of the deal. you get short changed for the canx flights, or u pay an exta 240 for flights that the second leg leaves before the first leg!!! I pointed this out to chat host who kept on responding canx your itenary. it looks like their policy to make extra money. My opinion, dont trust EDREAMS, OPODO who i used their website to book. It looks like companies like these and airlines like WIZZAIR have thought of ways to make extra money, by canx flights and keeping some of your hard earned cash. I emailed EDREAMS a complaint but i doubt they will respond, just like they never responded to my request to canx my prime subscription.

"I think my title says all. Having travelled in 52 countries and total having done 179 flights before using Egyptair I was struggling to find something that was a serious issue in any of them. Finally this week i used Egyptair for the first time in my life and unfortunately 4 times in a week because of the needs of my trip. My review might be long but worth to read it as to know what you are about to face. On the first flight from Athens to Egypt one passenger as we were waiting at the bus to take us to the aircraft went out and light a cigarette. Crazy!! The aircraft was old, dirty and a total mess inside from the passengers because staff didnt care to say or to do anything. Not any announcement from the pilot either on departing or landing or during the flight. This first flight delayed almost 20 minutes and the so called food was bad quality of empty sandwich, no coffee, no tea. The second flight from Cairo to Aswan we had to pass so many controls that they didnt know what they want, they were asking different things in every control and staff of the airport those with red shirts asking for money to pass you from the control. Be aware of them. Staff very rude. They didnt check electronic devices or liquids but their problem was our shoes. The aircraft was the only new one that we used but were flies roaming inside. First time in my life happened this. The flight delayed for 20 minutes again and only water was served. The airport of Aswan was old and no staff to assist you if you needed anything. Luggages delayed also. On the third flight from Luxor to Cairo the only good thing was the airport of Luxor which was new one but the same mess situation with the control. At the gate was noone most of the time and 25 minutes before the scheduled take off nobody said anything and suddenly announced a 40 minutes delay on an airport with two flights only!!! At the gate was passing everyone during that time with any control or security. Finally when we entered the aircraft we realised again that it ws again old and dirty and you might guess it with flights inside. There happened something extremely crazy thing. Passengers they argue that they didnt like the seat and they didnt want to sit, shelves abpve us where open, many were standing and the aircraft started to taxi. A completely chaos. Local passengers were talking on phones without anyone saying anything. Finally on last flight there was an adventure. On the fisrt control they took us back and forth 4 times trying to find if we had something on us without reason and still the guys with the red asking for money. After we finally passed the first control, the check in lady was very rude asking to connect our phones on the internet which cairo airport didnt give us access because we are tourists. then was the second control which they send us back to fill a form that noone said we had to fill it before. then was a third control right after the second. Why? Proceeding to the gate a staff member of a restaurant literally begged for money. Then it was a fourth control and after this a fifth. All rude and talking arabian only. Finally we reached the gate were again was noone there even 30 minutes before the flight and ofcourse many people passing the dorr of the gate again. Suddenly we saw some staff coming and we were amazed that we will not have delay. No not at all. When we entered aircraf the same total mess situation, flies again, old and dirty aircraft and then as door closed they opened them again for other passengers and on that time they started to load the luggage and some othe packages by throwing them, some of them also fell down but they were laughing. The delay was again 20 minutes, food again was crap. This company is the worse of all that I have traveled. I hope that I will not need to use it again.

"Picking egypt airlines was a choice to provide best choice for elderly passengers (my parents) in bussuiness class which turned to be the wrong decision .
Coming from cairo it was moderate taking in mind flight 855 on20 december (our flight) we took more than 1 hour in the aircraft which could not take off due to mechanical problem and we gad to switch plane ..till now its ok

Due to the age and miderate health of my parent i asked for wheelchair...i also take 2 wheechairs of my own just in case ( which was perfect in that delay in cairo)
Arriving to khartoum e were provided with the worst wheelchair ever ....the back waa laining the was no eough room for legs it was not just uncomfortable but harmful.

Talking to the khartoum station manger was a complete disaster....by the was these are the worst wheelchairs on khartoum airport since all local airline has good and better wheelchairs for sick, old and dusabled passengers

We refused thier chair and he was rushing us out which was his main concern...when we told him about wheelchair condition he told us thats land servises handling company which was poor explanation

I asked for my own chair , and he again refuesd they sudanese custom will allow him to take back from lugguage to gate which was BIG LIE

At the end he was so rude and he did not cooperate and tlld me i can complain at egyptair website ...can u imagine that kind of rudness.....for a buissness old passenger ....we took thier wheelchair teeling him he should be held responsible if anything goes wrong which he refused

The wheelchair has so little space for legs which was
unusable so we had to HOLD the paasenger legs with my hand all the way to gate which so painful to her.

Her back suffered great pain as her neck too so since yesterday she could not sleep of the pain i thought she might collapsed any time on me at thr airport due to sever pain at the gate ...a sudanese worker broght our wheelchair from lugguage passing customs with no questioning at all ......So the station manger was telling false information just to threw us out of the plane .

The airlines that was suppose to be most comfortable was the most terrible...the manger who was suppose to be most cooperative was the most rude, unprofessinal
I would not leave him without complain due to pain and suffering he caused me and my family

In the attached picture due to no place for legs the passenger (a woman 70 years old) is putting her legs on her walker on a moving lift car just imagine the pain.

I didnt want superior buiessness class treatment or good wheelchair seats i just want my own wheelchairs which is allowed at every airport
Paying 1500$ for buissness tickets should cover 100 or 200 of egypt air to buy new good wheelchairs or force handling company to provide better ones. Staff should communicate better with problem solving not problem making behaviour if not for buissness class reputation for humanity reasons

I was in Egypt when Canada banned flights from Africa due to Omicron.  My flight to Toronto was cancelled.  Egyptair was very accommodating and switched my flight to arrive at JFK in New York so that I could return home through the United States.  I ended up in the Cairo airport at the gate with what I had researched as the recommended PCR Covid test but the United States had changed the rules to the 24 hour Antigen test the day before and unfortunately I was unaware.  I was denied boarding due to the new rule.  Egyptair booked me on the next flight in two days and did not charge me to change it again for me despite it being due to the test error.  All of the staff at the airport were so helpful.    I have flown Egyptair for years and have always found them to be pretty good but this time they really went above and beyond to help me in this frustrating and stressful situation.

"Egyptair is by far the worst airline I have flown. Checkin is extremely slow for the business class, which is ridiculous. Staff is unfriendly and would rather chit-chat than check in waiting customers. We were running 30 min late for the checkin in JFK and even though the flight left 1.5 hrs late, they still. closed the counter 1 hr before departure. We called ahead and asked them to wait for us at the checkin counter for 30 extra minutes and the supervisor was rude to us and hang up the phone several times.
My wife needed a special meal due to her health condition, I followed directions on Egyptair site to email them, yet no one responded to my email after I emailed them 4 times.

"I had the worst experience ever with Air Egypt and I highly DO NOT recommend it as an airlines.
I was travelling with my 2 and half year old baby to USA via Air Egypt from Lebanon; I have called the airlines 2 days prior my flight and they have confirmed that my son doesn’t need a PCR test for the flight. (The call is recorded and can be checked by Air Egypt)
While checking in, I was astonished that a PCR test is required for kids under 2 years old and I was obliged to take my son outside of the airport without any car seat with a complete stranger to do the PCR and have the result on time in order to catch my flight.
After all the rush, our flight was delayed for 1 hour in Beirut.
On our way back, I was shocked; I have received a phone call from my husband in Beirut telling me that our connection flight from Cairo to Beirut having a layover of 3 hours was cancelled and the first available flight from Cairo to Beirut was after 10 hours .
Imagine having a 13 hours delay in an airport with a kid! I was once again forced to buy another ticket with another airline to avoid w huge layover of 13 hours that I had no fault in it.

"They cancelled the flight from Alexandria to Cairo without telling us and we had to go to the office to check it out as we were unable to do online! When we went to the EgyptAir office they informed us the flight to Cairo had been cancelled with no reasons given which caused us a lot of problems. I asked for a refund - the flight cost 45 GBP so the value of two tickets was 90 GBP but after taxes would only give us half of the money. Why the hell I have to pay taxes on flights that they have cancelled and only receive half the money. Even then, we were asked to return the next day to collect the money which meant yet another trip to the office and additional hassle for us, when Egyptair had created the issue to begin with.

Unlike Air France Egyptair manages to board its planes in an orderly manner though it may be a good idea to board business class AFTER economy since all economy passengers cross the business section which is not good in Covid times. Both flights were uneventful, the attendants were courteous both at check-in and during the flight, the snack was served promptly.

"To whom it might concern,

My name is Zorana Vucicevic, my booking reference is 24CFI2 and on November 16th I had flight with your company from Budapest to Cairo, and then from Cairo to Jeddah.

Moment when they took my passport on Budapest airport they said I can’t travel. Officers on check in did not even ask about my vaccinations or my visa or my PCR test. They refused me when they checked my passport. Gentlemen from their office upstairs get down and said I can not go because there is some big restrictions for travellers going from Cairo to Jeddah.

My husband in Jeddah wanted to make some arrangement for me to land there. But it did not work out.

Later on, gentlemen said I did not have PCR ready and that is the reason they refused me and everywhere said even on web page and my visa restrictions it is enough to have vaccine or PCR up to 72 hours before flight.

Budapest office is offering me new ticket and they said it is going to be free of charge but I get bill on $120 for exchange of ticket.

Route is the same Budapest Cairo Jeddah but honestly I do not feel safe with your company it is super unprofessional what happened to me on airport and now you asking for more money.

I have AirBnb reservation too and I can not cancel it, so I payed for no reason and I lost money here too, then on my transportation from Osijek to Budapest and back.

I wish to request for money refund from airplane company Egyptair on my account because I am scared to go the same route and then get stack in Cairo and what then??

I hope you will consider this email because I will complain more!

When I wanted to tip him 100 LE as a small token of appreciation he adamantly refused stating that it was his job -- a completely surreal situation in a country where tip extortion is a form of art. The highest level of professionalism.

The flight was good.

"My experience flying in business class, on my outbound flight on EgyptAir, was disappointing to say the least.  I was expecting a friendly, inviting atmosphere, however it seemed to me the attendants were more interested in sitting and talking amongst themselves than attending to their customers.  They literally ran to their gathering place to continue talking and sitting.   Not one time did anyone greet us personally, I asked for a menu of the meals, which is typically already at your seat on international flights, and was told it was coming.  Instead food in aluminum containers marked A, B and C were served from a rolling cart.  Do you want chicken, beef, etc.  I was stunned.  The place setting was amateurish! I forgot, no place setting.  I understand caution with COVID but the service wasn't even from training class 101.  My return flight was much better, service, smiles, food and settings.

"Flying to Egypt had been my 40th country I've visited in the past 10 years. I say this in order for you to be aware that I have been on numerous flights, coming and going on various airlines.

My flight home from Cairo was horrendous. I have never been on a flight where Flight Attendants were so lackluster.

Many people on the flight were not wearing their masks and were not approached by the staff to rectify. There was complete disregard for any of their COVID regulations. As more of an annoyance, one person's alarm went off for a series of minutes, to the point where I had time to get up and ask the Flight Attendant to address the issue, alas I was deflected.

As we were approaching landing, there were 4 people in scope from my seat who were not in their seats (three in a row were missing, left their backpack in the one seat, and showed up after we landed - where could they have been??) One family, with two young boys, were in the row near me and weren't even seated during landing!

Upon landing, there was no tray check, no seat belt check, no reclining and armchair check, no walkway clearance, nor was there a garbage pick up - all of these are fine reasons to not recommend your airline. Egyptair clearly has very little concern for the safety of your passengers.

As we were deplaning, I was disgusted by the amount of trash left behind on the flight. There was very little regard for passenger's comfortability, with the complete lack of removing garbage from peoples seats.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiepani,Katie P wrote a review Sep 2021,Katie P,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cairo - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r809830402-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Horrendous - lack of care for health and safety of their passengers,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst experience ever.
I frequently fly Dubai to Sharm with layover in Cairo. This time, without any notice flight has been changed to Dubai - Cairo - Hurgada - Sharm.
Upon arrival in Hurgada (same time as usual arrival in Sharm) I have been told I am in Hurgada (tickets timing and location do not mention Hurgada).
I have been told it was my fault and they charged me 2100 Egyptian pounds for a new tickets. Furthermore, this trip took additional 12 hours that nobody even cared that I spent at the airport’s bench. I would not wish that experience to worst enemy. Lost 160 usd and 12 hours of my life.

Furthermore, despite legal requirements to wear mask on board, many people do not follow. The crew does absolutely nothing to speak to such passengers. Terrible and not safe.

"The first clue that I was going to have a horrible trip was the way the agent at the gate was screaming at passengers. Service on board was ok ( but honestly i slept through 80% of the flight). Once in DC I noticed my checked bag was missing. I immediately tried to file a claim, unfortunately the agent taking care of baggage claims was an employee of Dulles and not for Egyptair. She was unaware of the claim process and had me fill out a general lost baggage form with the promise that someone would call me in 2-3 days (1st lie). After not getting said call, I called the airport number multiple time through out the day, no one ever picked up.  I sent multiple emails to their  lost baggage claim email that went unanswered. I ended up calling their reservation number in order to at least get someone on the phone, that was un-helpful. Its been more then two weeks now and I have yet to get anyone to tell me where my bag is..

"My experience today with EgyptAir:
Honesty and credibility require me to tell my experience as I said my bad experience and the rupture last Friday with Egypt Air.
This is my perfect experience today as well.
The flight takeoff was supposed to be 7:20 pm, and to be arrived an hour later, but as usual, I found out when I arrived at the airport that they had changed to be 7:35 pm, At 7:10 pm, they announced their apologies for the delay. The plane was delayed and took off at 8 pm. The important thing is, they apologized.
The trip that was supposed to take an hour but it took only 45 minutes, looks like the pilot increased its speed 😂😂😂😂
Egypt Air stuff at the airport, and the flight attendant was wearing masks, and safety glasses, and they insisted all the passengers to keep wearing masks all the time.
The treatment is very good and professional

"Here I tell my experience today with EgyptAir, as usual: Not the cheapest company, of course, and it is definitely the most expensive. I have a very important commitment in Cairo for one and half day and I have no time to drive to Cairo for 7 hours and go back 7 hours and alone, so I booked a flight from Sharm to Cairo, The flight time was supposed to be 3:25 in the afternoon, and arrive one hour later, I got surprised when I arrived to the airport that the flight was delayed to be at 4 pm without and notice, At 3:55 in the afternoon we got on the bus and moved to the plane and stood on the front of the stairs, after 5 minutes locked in the bus and we would die from the heat, the bus back to the gate again, when I asked why we back they told me the Cabten ask engineer to check the plane, what they didn’t checked yet  I asked the counter of EgyptAir to register my complaint in the presence of the tourism police and without any interest or consideration for anything and in a very bad manner. He told me to go outside the gate and lock for it and do what you want to do. I asked the gate guard to ask the tourism police in the airport hall to come to see him and of course without any  Attention and procrastination in the hope that I will be bored and forget and walk away, I called police emergency on 122, and the world turned in one minute. The airport police, tourism, the official of EgyptAir and the official of civil aviation all attended and tried to reconcile the matter, claiming that is normal, but with my insistence the airport officer say its your right and he brought me a paper and wrote my complaint and it was registered in five minutes and they stopped the last bus for a while  until I finished everything, The take-off was supposed to be 3:25 pm, and the plane actually take-off at 4:55 pm.Also all Egypt air stuff in the airport and the flight attendant don’t ware face masks and the safety procedures in flight was not presented and they just said all safety information on the the paper in front of you in seat pocket. The question to EgyptAir is that; your price is very expensive, with no quality, system, or anything good. Whoever wants to be a large, respectable and expensive company offers what suits that. The worst company, as usual, and its employees do not have any knowledge of how to serve customers. I am going to fill a complaint with EgyptAir itself, Star Alliance Group and Civil Aviation here.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/98/e3/55/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mohmed_elghawaby,MAG wrote a review Aug 2021,MAG,Egypt,262 contributions,57 helpful votes,Sharm El Sheikh - Cairo,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r802795433-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Unorganized and not professional,Date of travel: August 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Don’t fly with EgyptAir unless you don’t mind getting your flight canceled and no refund. We had a group of 13 that had our flight canceled from Hurghada to Cairo. We had to take a bus from Hurghada to Cairo so we could leave because EgyptAir wouldn’t get us there.

"Flight MS 996 July 24th 2021 2:05 pm from Toronto to Cairo was AMAZING.

I coukd see hiw much effort they put in making their meals so delicious and full of variety. We got an amazing hot dinner choices of chicken, beef or fish and dessert and fruit as well as soft fresh breaf, once we took off wer then got multiple drinks across the 10 hour flight. Then we were served a very delicious snack like a club sandwich of turkey and cheese. We then got a yummy breakfast before landing, fresh croissant, cheese, fruits, butter, eggs....i felt like i was in a hotel.

Seats were spacious and extremely comfortable and the crew were out of thus world especially Iman El Khouly if I remember correctly. She kept checking on my 17 year old daughter who had a terrible migraine and offered her srunks then said she can ask for a doctor. They all had an amazing smile on their faces the whole time very decent and professional.

"Before I start just keep in mind that my experience with Egyptair is simple: I call them, book the flight, pay for it, and go to the airport on my departure date.

Traveled with the airline on four occasions (international flights), never regretted it!

The staff are very friendly (I was sleeping on one flight & the attendant left me the meal on the seat beside me)
legroom is good (I'm 183 cm), never had any problems with it.

When there is an onboard entertainment system, it is great, although they will probably have any sex scenes removed 😂 , but my most recent flight didn't have it, instead, it had Wifi, but I didn't really use it, so I can't help with that.

They don't usually serve alcoholic beverages on-board, but they said I could buy duty-free items (which are usually alcoholic beverages) on board by credit card, but I don't really need to drink on an airplane, let alone pay for it.

Do remember to ask about the cancellation fees, because I have seen plenty of reviews by people upset about not getting a refund.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fady_Ibrahim,Fady A wrote a review Jul 2021,Fady A,,1 contribution,,Budapest - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r800872665-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Great experiences, just know what you want before you book",Date of travel: July 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was travelling to Dubai on flight MS 905 from Cairo at Terminal 2 on 9 July 2021. The immigration supervisor at terminal 2 was rude and harassed me by doubting my passport and extremely rude. I am a frequent traveler and never been disrespected like that. I complaint to another supervisor and he apologized and told me that he will speak to this arrogant and ill mannered individual. The immigration male supervisor at terminal 2 was not old and came to the immigration counter after being called by an inexperienced female immigration clerk at the counter.
This is not the way to treat visitors to the country who bring and spend money. Be grateful and have some manners. This is the way duty is done by professional immigration people around the world. Do it with Egyptian people, not with selected internation travelers.

Also, avoid this airline at all cost and don’t get fooled by the pyramid pictures and brochures in the west. These people are untrustworthy and rude, especially the immigration supervisor officials at Cairo airport. There are far better airlines and countries.

"I booked with Egypt air through their own website on the 1st of May my business tickets for me and my family, total of 4 business tickets, one way route from Johannesburg to Dubai. My booking reference is RNGZK2. Attached is pictures of my booking and email I received cancelling my tickets.

On the 6th of May, only 24 hours before departure, I received email from Egypt air cancelling all my tickets without obvious reasons and without informing me or calling me. I called the Head office in Johannesburg where they told me that flight is still on, but my tickets is been cancelled without them knowing whats going on. I called the head office in dubai where I was told that my tickets been cancelled because its coming from South Africa and we are not allowed into dubai. But I told them that I'm  Emirati citizen and its stating in Egypt air website that all Emirati are excluded and we can enter UAE without any problems. They agreed on that and told me my business tickets were taken by someone else and only economy seats ane available for the 7th of May! Or I can reschedule my flight for the 14th after Eid! 

I told them that I booked and fully paid my 4 business tickets for the 7th as its even more expensive than the 14th because of Eid season and I would like my business tickets back as I didn't cancel or request cancelling and I still wants my tickets.. long story short, I wasn't given my business tickets and I had to fly economy class despite paying full amount a week before for business seats.

"On March 30, 2021, I arrived at Washington Dulles airport to catch flight #MS932 to Cairo Egypt  (booking reference # M4GU0D). When I arrived I observed a chaotic situation without any social distancing and barely any resemblance to crowd control or customer. There were many passages that, did not have their Convid-19 negative verification certificate printed out. Because we are in the digital age I can understand why passages would assume that they would be able to just show an agent digital results on a mobile device. The agents were requiring passages with their results on digital devices to print them there at the counter, Egyptair had a single laptop with a malfunctioning printer at a counter that all of the passages had to share. Again, there was not any social distancing, no hand sanitizer, no assistance for passengers who were not computer literate and the male ticket agents had extremely bad attitudes. This created a situation of chaos. As a result of all of the chaos, some passages miss the closing of the boarding gate including myself. I was told that I would not be able to board the flight and I was offered to have the flight rebooked for free. The gentleman at the counter whose name was Mohammed told me that I would not have to pay a change fee. When I got to the counter to arrange for a new flight the attendant who was making arrangements for other passages was charging what he called an upgrade fee. I watched him as he did this to three different passages, with each of the fees being different for each passages sitting in the same section. It was now my turn. He told me that I had to pay a fee. I asked, ""What is the fee for"". He said that it was upgrading the service. I then asked him what are the upgrades and what do I get. He looked surprised that I asked that question and had no explanation for it. I then asked him will I be getting something extra and what I will be able to pick my seat as I did in my original booking.  He said no. He seemed to be angry and told me if I did not want to do that then I should call customer service in New York. I left the airport and called New York customer service and I was on the phone stuck on hold for approximately two hours before I was disconnected by their telephone system. I had no better luck with their customer service. Today March 31, 2021, I once again tried to contact the ticket agent and customer service by phone with the exact same results. I now have a return flight two weeks from now which I will not be in Cairo to on. This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I am so grateful that this was not an emergency travel situation.

"I bought my tickets, and the day before my flight I got covid positive test results. What should I do? I had to apply for a refund. Later they said I can rebook my tickets (cuz I wanna travel once I cured), I agreed for that, but in 2 weeks I got a refund 95$ out of 250$!!It's less than 50%!! Seriously? Is Egypt air trying to get the advantage of this whole covid situation? And it's unpredictable, I didn't c ancel it with my will, I had shown them my results even, they just said sorry, we can't refund more!
Before I used to like Egypt air, however, heard bad feedbacks, no wonder why people say it's the worst Airline in Africa.
I'm disappointed, I will never use their service again, and wouldn't recommend to anyone!

"I booked the Egypt air flight to go from/to Cairo - Sharm El Sheikh. On the way to Sharm the schedule was changed 45 minutes and in addition to that the departure was late, which is not that critical. However, on my way back the flight was cancelled at all and moved to another date which i couldn’t accept due to a second flight that date departing from Cairo, different airline. Thanks God there were 2 flights from Sharm and i was lucky to book the flight. The schedule was not convenient for me, but it’s ok. The most annoying thing is that when changing the booking the Egypt air rep (operator) told me that it’s not a fault of an airline but airport!!!! What??? Of course it’s an airline who does the flight schedule changes. So, planning the flights with Egypt Air leave some additional time, may be even extra day not to be in the bad situation.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/b4/3e/1f/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArtM457,Artem wrote a review Mar 2021,Artem,"Moscow, Russia",113 contributions,71 helpful votes,Cairo - Sharm El Sheikh,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r783954694-EGYPTAIR-World.html,The flight was cancelled!,Date of travel: March 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Used their online booking system to manage my booking and add extra luggage.

The system took payment three times, and didn't provide the service of extra baggage.

The payment system took my money in GBP and converted it to dollars. I repeatedly asked for a refund for 4 months and got no response, except excuses.

I reclaimed the dollars from my credit card company, but by that time the exchange rate had caused me a loss on the original money I had stole from me.

"Contacted to cancel as I had booked directly with the airline, no middle party, provided the option to receive a refund instead of credit which in my circumstances I did take as I couldn't commit to credit , relentlessly made SURE I wasn't forgotten by countless emails to office in UK, made sure they realised the seriousness of me not receiving my refund. They said once the flights had resumed the refund will be in my account. Despite recognising the flights had to resume, I pestered over FB and email and sure enough once they updated on FB flights are resuming during 2020, I contacted again via email whether domestic or international, I received a refund on my debit card.  Based on the reviews I have read, I will book directly instead of through Travel agents as information gets lost and causes more distress under limited working conditions. Thank you for my refund.

"The flight from CMN to CAI (2.15 pm on 12/08) was delayed by 5 hours. The connecting flight from CAI to ADD on 12/09 was cancelled. It took them 4 hours to give us proper information. They told me they would put me on the CAI to ADD flight the next day (24 hours later). 45 min. before departure the Egypt Air transit desk told me that I could not board because my Covid-PCR test had expired. 30 min. before departure they realized that it was a mistake, because they had confused the day of the test with the day of my birthday. By that time, the boarding of the flight had closed. It took another 6 hours for Egypt Air to figure out where I could do a new test. I got a special permission to do it within the terminal and had to pay EUR 90. I never received a receipt for this test although I asked several times. By that time, I had spent 34 hours in the transit terminal, without proper information, without accommodation, without communication (there is only 30 min. free internet). It was very cold and they did not even give us a blanket. On 01/10 at 12.30 pm I was put up in an airport hotel. I was rebooked on a flight CAI – NBO – BJM 2 days later. I left CAI on 12/12 9.30 pm and arrived in BJM on 12/13 10 am. The scheduled arrival was 12/09 1 pm, 4 days earlier. Of course, my luggage did not show up and I put in a claim. It finally arrived in BJM on 01/21, with a delay of another 8 days. Egypt Air (in the transit terminal in CAI) was not helpful at all. The staff was extremely rude, impolite and incompetent. They took our passport “to process the new tickets”, they let little children sleep on the floor without even a blanket, and no warm meal in nearly 35 hours, not able to communicate with anyone with only 30 min. free Wifi. No one listened to us and no one ever apologized. Of course no refund for anything was given. You cannot reach anyone by phone and e-mails are being left unanswered.

The aircraft was in good condition, clean on the whole and reasonably comfortable for a four hour journey. Ample legroom as well as footrest available. If booking economy seats aim for those numbered in 20s.

Screen blurb before take off was a bit OT. In flight entertainment of good quality. Charger facility available.

If vegetarian, one needs to book in advance. The quality of meals provided was very much below standard.

"The rudest customer service officer I've ever spoken to. My flight got cancelled due to restrictions against travel from the UK so I called to request a refund of some sorts. After a long wait, the lady was extremely rude and offered no help whatsoever, saying they're waiting for new govt guidance regarding refunds vs changing bookings etc. She ultimately started fobbing off responsibility and said this is not the number to contact for refunds. She then failed to provide a contact number for refunds but did offer an email address. Before I could add anything else she hung up the phone. This was my first and last time resorting to Egyptair. I would like to add that the only reason I booked a flight through them was that my Turkish airlines flight was cancelled the day before and their service was great and extremely straight forward. Turkish airlines offered a full refund or an open ticket to the same destination valid for 1 year. What makes matters worse is that Egyptair cancelled the flight prematurely even though my destination was accepting flights from the UK for 2 more days.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8252VAahmeds,Ahmed Sh wrote a review Dec 2020,Ahmed Sh,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,London - Khartoum,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r779875004-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Terrible customer service,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First, I want to make clear that my one and only experience with EgyptAir was during the COVID pandemic ( 03 flights in November 2020 and December 2020). Therefore, I believe that the context of the pandemic should be taken into account for what I will report below.

My wife and I have read on the internet a couple of times that EgyptAir frequently cancels flights or changes them very often sometimes without giving the passenger enough time. For that reason, we were advised to buy tickets through our travel agency that we've hired for our trip in Egypt because in case of cancellation or flight changes, the agency would do everything and there would be no more headache.

Well, we used EgyptAir on 03 flights:
1. Cairo to Aswan - Boeing 737-800
2. Hurghada to Sharm El Sheikh (via Cairo) - Airbus A220-300
3. Sharm El Sheikh to Cairo - Airbus A220-300

We were warned and it actually happened: 02 of our flights were canceled. As they were morning flights, I believe that the cancelation was due to the lack of passengers. And again, I don't want to be unfair: we are in a pandemic time. But the cancellations occurred two days before the flight. Thank goodness we had extra time planned, so that didn't hinder our trip at all. So take that into account.

Now, details about the flights in general.

The Check-in process was very quick and our checked bags were not weighed anytime during the trip.

We used Boeing 737-800 and AirBus A220-300 aircraft. In both cases, the flight was very smooth. The cleanliness of the cabins was reasonable. There was no dirt on the seats or on the ground, but on the LCD screens and windows, there was a lot of grease and fingerprints.

There were only USB-A (common USB) ports, with no other ports for charging devices.
Good legroom.

On all flights, we received 01 bottle of water of 300 ml and 01 sachet of hand sanitizer. Nothing else. Consider that flights in Egypt are always very short, due to the size of the territory.

Even though there was space left in the back of the plane, we were not allowed to change seats. They said that it was forbidden due to the pandemic. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because it is much riskier to squeeze passengers all next to each other at the front of the aircraft than to let people sit with social distance. What's the point?!

On a single flight, from Hurghada to Sharm El Sheikh (via Cairo) there was a passenger who refused to wear a face mask. The cabin crew requested repeatedly, but he said he would wear it but he didn't. In the end, nothing happened. The only thing I think should have been done was to tell the passenger that he would be removed from the aircraft if he didn't wear his mask. But that did not happen. Not only did he not wear his mask, but he also walked to the toilet without it. Well, I think that airlines should be more rigid in cases like this.

The overall experience with EgyptAir was good. Two flight cancelations could have ruined our trip if I hadn't put aside extra time for this unforeseen event. But for the third time I want to make it clear: we are in a time of the pandemic. And I just wasn’t too bothered because traveling in COVID times can really bring about these hassles.

So plan your trip and reserve extra time for surprises if using EgyptAir.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/75/1c/8f/kaducarrasco.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaducarrasco,Kadu Carrasco wrote a review Dec 2020,Kadu Carrasco,"Sao Paulo, SP",626 contributions,174 helpful votes,Cairo - Aswan,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r779598678-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Watch out for cancelations and changes to your flight (Dec 2020 and pandemic updates),Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Due to the covid flight cancellations the communication with Egypt Air in Egypt was non existent and they frankly could care less including the social media team. They just copied and pasted answers irrelevant to questions. However the office in Abu Dhabi even though they had their hands tied did the best they could and maintained good communication and refunded me as best as they could.

"Pros:
The inflight service was great on Cairo to DC route. The crew were very nice, they gave a lot of disinfectant supplies, the meals were well-portioned (small) for a night flight, and were generally very good. The EgyptAir’s brand new 787 is cool! I disembarked totally wowed in DC. The airplane was only 20-30% filled (probably due to covid), and so I had 3 seats to sleep on (and so did everyone!), it almost felt like business class flight. In 10
hours of flight, I had a good night sleep as if I slept at home in my comfy bed (thanks for spaciousness of the airplane and the increased pressurization) - I didn’t feel tired at all in the end. The price was also very attractive, and I also did not become subject to Europe Travel Ban, and that’s why I went through Egypt in the first place.
Domestic flight from Sharm-el-Sheikh to Cairo was fine also, although I wasn’t as wowed as on US-bound flight. I still found it above what I expected. Ground crews in Sharm-el-Sheikh were very polite and truly helpful - they even waived the box packaging fee because I had no cash on me at all (I had a box not a bag). They also waived excess baggage fee (I had 2kg overweight) to show Egyptian kindness!
After a 6h30m flight that I had earlier that day with SCAT (Kazakhstan-based low-cost airline), the EgyptAir made me feel like a truly valued customer and get from A to B with minimum stress and maximum comfort - all kudos to them, they went above all my expectations!

Cons:
1.) They never pick up their call center phone. I wanted to make an upgrade to business class, but they did not pick up. I tried both US and Egypt call center.
2.) Airports in Egypt are terrible (cleanliness wise, and bureaucracy-wise: they make you go through X-Ray 4 times in Cairo) - not airline’s fault. I found both Sharm-el-Sheikh and Cairo airports to be terrible.
3.) If you go to their airport ticketing office and try to pay with your credit/debit card - be sure to really prove you are who you are, they will ask you 100 questions about it, I guess they have credit card fraud problems in Egypt, and that’s why they are so suspicious about it.
4.) Their flights are unfortunately only bookable at their own website at the lowest fare. If you try third-parties, fares are much higher. I saved $$$ by booking at their official website.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeankF7737XL,Jean K wrote a review Nov 2020,Jean K,"Anchorage, Alaska",8 contributions,,Sharm El Sheikh - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r777861270-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"In flight service was great on a CAI - IAD flight, not so great on the ground",Date of travel: October 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently flew business class with Egyptair and was extremely unhappy with the poor service. My seat was broken and didn't recline.

So I called and was placed on hold .... and YES I’m still on hold.There was no ZERO for recommending option... You should NEVER use that airline even if you HAVE to go to Egypt.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/6e/c6/4c/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9516WYdavids,D.

"I booked a friend of mine to travel with them. It was a journey with a few hours transit.

5 days before flying I called to check if everything is ok and I was told that the first flight is ok but the second is cancelled. I asked why I didn’t get a cancellation email, they said I will get it the next day, there is something wrong with the system. I called again 3 hours later, was told the same thing. Long story short, for 5 days they kept saying one flight is going the other cancelled which makes no sense because if one flight is cancelled, the whole flight should be cancelled. Then again some staff say all the flights are going. So I ended up booking another flight which required a covid test! Then guess what, a few hours to departure they call me and tell me that now all the flights are going!!! After days of about 5 people telling me the flight is cancelled and 2 saying its not, this is the response I got!! The other new flight with another airline I booked was leaving in 2 days and my friend just wanted to get out of the country asap so we had to scramble and pack and run to the airport at very early morning! Needless to say the queue waiting was the worst. We were in queue for more than an hour yet there were like 10 people in front of me which isn’t even much! I wasted my time and money booking another flight and taking a covid test which was useless because the results were sent days after my friend had already departed. The heartache and headache this airline caused me I’ll never forgive nor forget and never again will I ever book with them even if it’s the only flight existing! That was the worst travel experience ever!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/7f/e8/b7/jenna-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennaGlobeTrotter,Jenna J wrote a review Aug 2020,Jenna J,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",405 contributions,121 helpful votes,Dubai - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r763167381-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst experience ever!!,Date of travel: August 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It is so sad that Egypt Airlines is more concern about money and more money instead of their customers. I am disabled and I used this airline because it was more affordable for me but you get what you pay for. I arrived before they closed the check in station but was held up do to my inability to walk. they closed and I was told I had to call they plane still had an hour before it was to depart and Egypt Airline left me and my family. I was told I can return the next day and board the next flight but she made it seem my ticket or standby will be the case and it was not they billed me yet again and my prior tickets voided I was so discussed and upset. I required handicap accommodations and seating which I did not get I was placed in regular seating.  the area i was to get was offered to a woman with a child why I was crushed for 12 hours and when I tried to stretch I was ordered to please sit down. Several other issues took place like the bathroom which I was near smelled horrible before we even left and as the bathroom was used the smell got worse who could eat and relax. I tried to speak to the staff for help and better seating but was ignored. I reached out to Egypt Air corporate for help or at least a partial refund and that was a joke this company knows they have a very bad reputation and they just do not care. Egypt Air closes there windows an hour early they do not care what your situation is but  there have a phone number listed where you cannot reach anyone and they love to bill you more money do not expect any help. All the bad reviews I read after my experience I honestly believe because we experienced the same issues.

"I rarely write reviews but I simply have to share my experience with EgyptAir for those who are choosing between two options - EgyptAir and other airline. Please choose the other airlines, it surely can't be as bad as Egyptair.
Simply stop replying - that's how Egyptair's customer service solve issues and it didn't happen to me once, not twice but three times therefore I'm not exaggerating. I won't be naming the individuals as I don't want them to get fired during these difficult times but Egyptair won't be providing a good service until they learn how to value each and every customer. I could be a potentially loyal customer as I have a family in Egypt and I grew sick of stopovers but I will rather stick to Turkish Airlines as it never disappointed me in any way. I fly at least 3 times a year, this means six flights in total every year and let's say I'll be probably flying for the next 20, 30 years as I'm young. This is around 41000 euros approximately over the course of 30 years - at least. May not be so much but if every disappointed customer did the same Egyptair would eventually run out of business.

Now to the issue which the CS team hasn't resolved in 14 days. I was adding my frequent flyer number into the section but it didn't work so after few attempts I just took a screenshot so I can resolve it with the CS, I had other issues with the information but that was resolved. So I contacted the CS, unfortunately, the first employee did not read the email so I kindly replied that she already received all the info in the previous email, her reaction was simply to stop replying. I decided to contact her again in two days, I got an immediate response from someone else - yet again not resolving my issue and providing me no help whatsoever. As I've been working in the CS myself I made a few suggestions on how we can deal with the situation but unfortunately, I didn't get any answers. I sent another follow-up email before my flight which hasn't been answered. I'm deeply disappointed and I will rather waste a lot of my time on stopovers than flying with Egyptair.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabrielafaithj,Gabriela Faith J wrote a review Jul 2020,Gabriela Faith J,,4 contributions,4 helpful votes,Cairo - Vienna,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r759211914-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Where do I even begin..,Date of travel: July 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked a ticket in October, it was two ways ticket Cairo-Berlin. I called after I travelled to change the date of my ticket, the return way, they advised that I should book a new ticket and ask for a refund because it would only save me 2500 EGP but instead I saved literally nothing!!.
After this, I booked a new ticket and while booking a new ticket I found out that it was the worst advice ever, I wasted more money because the ticket doesn't have any value when it's refundable, below I'll attach an email suggesting that I should change my ticket and forget about refunding it and that it's valid till 3rd of October.
Today, my friend called the call centre from Egypt, they told her we can't find enough info regarding this ticket no. she should buy a new ticket and refund the old one.
The question is how is this possible to lose a ticket. based on their advice, I keep losing money. How ticket info is suddenly lost, the call centre isn't replying to my emails. They can't change my ticket.
What company is this, why I can't just travel easy, book a ticket, give me the right advice, change a ticket for me? how it can be that ticket info is lost
Is this what we get for supporting our country and its airlines. is this what we get for choosing Egyptair. Losing money and tickets without any reason, what kind of database or system is this! AND I DON'T know how a ticket that was going to save me 2500 EGP doesn't have any value when refunded. Really, you are getting on my nerves, I get headache every time I need to book a ticket due to your unorganized unprofessional call centre team.

"It's a very short flight however, it is spectacular with good visibility. We flew on a new Airbus 320 which is very comfortable. In Hurghada and during the flight the Covid-19 imposed precautions were respected. Once landed and safety belt light off though, passengers stood up and did not respect physical distancing while waiting for the door to open. The flight crew said nothing. Much worse was at the exit of the terminal where hundreds of people were waiting for the passengers from other flights. It was difficult to pass by them and some were not even wearing masks!

"We had round trip flights on Egyptair via JFK New York – Cairo Egypt. Typical coach class comfort. We always use disinfectant wet wipes on every airplane, and it was good thing because we saw lots of dirt on the wipes after wiping down the entertainment screen, tray tables, armrests, and seat belt buckles. Egyptair provides typical long-haul flight amenities such as, in-flight entertainment, pillow, and blanket. In addition, they give each flyer a little pouch containing a toothbrush, toothpaste, eye mask, socks, hand sanitizer, fresh-wipe, ear plugs, and earbuds (two-jack style) for the entertainment
The flights were uneventful and on-time. The food was decent. No alcohol. Flight attendants were okay, but not as friendly as US flight attendants. The only negative things about the flights were 1) the restrooms became very dirty – it looked like the only things done were adding soap and towels – water (I hope) and toilet paper littered the floor, and 2) the flight attendants did not come around very often to offer water or anything else.

"After reading several negative reviews, I had no high expectations and was ready for very low standard of service and facilities. I have to admit instead that my short haul flight was better than I thought.

"Me and my husband were travelling with a 8 month old baby and I was 5 months pregnant at the time. There was no option for us to choose our own seat when returning back to Dubai, so even after requesting the baby seat we were still placed at the back of the plane during a night flight. We asked the staff if it was possible to move since there was empty seats and no babies at the front and we wanted to use the baby bassinet area. We asked the staff on more than 1 occasion and our request was completely ignored.
During the flight we had several encounters with staff that were rude and disrespectful regarding our needs. We even asking for the baby meal that was never actually delivered to us, so our son never got the food we paid for.
Airlines are supposed to make you feel comfortable and relaxed during flights however this was the complete opposite.

"Late leaving Nairobi for Cairo w/connections to London & Los Angeles, we missed our CAI/LHR connection (the agent in Nairobi told us that they would hold the plane).

"I was supposed to travel to Aswan on flight number 94 at 5:55 am and I arranged for a transfer to Abou Simbel afterwards to catch for a Nile Cruise .
My plan was to go early to avoid any surprises.
Because of bad weather I arranged to go 3 hours before my flight .
The first surprise was that they cancelled my flight and postponed to the next flight at 7:15 , ok maybe because of bad weather which is just some heavy rain by the way.
They called for the flight on time, we got on buses, suddenly they asked us to return back to terminal as they discovered there was no crew on the plane.
It is 10 am now and I had to ask them when will they solve the problem , though I think professionally they should announce what will they do .

"Already at boarding the priority was not respected for business passengers, as soon as I entered the plane I realized that maybe I was on ""jokes aside"", or I had boarded a plane of a truly fourth world airline.
the welcome drinks were just plain fruit juices, the VERY VERY dirty seats, to be honest the whole cabin smelled of dirt, I was so disgusted that if I could get off I would have done it willingly.
in order to avoid getting intoxicated with food I preferred to go to sleep (hahahaha) sleeping is another fantasy that cannot be attributed because the seats were not even 180 degrees wide, in no business class of European and / or American airlines had I ever found a similar seat.
constantly in the cabin there was a stench of unpleasant food, never as in this trip I counted the minutes to get to the final destination, normally traveling in business class means being served and revered with quality products and with good perfumes and branded spirits (otherwise why pay crazy numbers to travel in business), here is none of this, therefore if you really have to travel with egyptair put your heart in peace otherwise you change airline and very quickly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/91/c2/a4/dp60.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dpsenior2605,Dpsenior2605 wrote a review Mar 2020,Dpsenior2605,"Florence, Italy",209 contributions,158 helpful votes,Mumbai - Rome,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r750612395-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Absolutely to be avoided at any cost,Date of travel: March 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Heathrow to Cairo on Ms777 on 14th February. Check in was really simple with adequate staff available if help was needed. Boarding again was straight forward being row block method. Every seat had a pillow and blanket and was spacious with good leg room which is important to me being 6ft 2in. The only problem was on take off, the plane was fully boarded and ready to go at 2pm,its original departure time, but we waited on the tarmac until 2.40 before departure. Their drinks service was good (non alcoholic only). Their in-flight entertainment was excellent with charging points and wifi links. The meal was also really good one of the tastiest of any airline I've flown with. The plane was a modern wide bodied 777.

"In brief:
Unpleasant, unclassy, uncompliing to international laws.

Really low standards, onflight was average, but 6 hours delay from bangkok. Issues about ongoing flight at check-in (im european, final destination was istanbul, i had to speak with a responsible to make the check-in stewardess comply with international laws to board me and consider istanbul was close enough to bulgarian/european border to land there without any ongoing flight. Maybe a lack of training or geographical knowledge, a shame, though.)

"I flew Egyptair flight number MS759 on February 28, 2020 from Cairo to Copenhagen. I boarded the Boeing 737-800 just before 10:00 a.m. which happened to be the scheduled take off time. I was received by very friendly and extremely polite hospitality staff. My seat 9A, second row window seat. Business class seats are roomy and very comfortable and is much better than business class seats in other international airlines. I requested air hostess to move to a window seat in the first row. I was moved to the seat after takeoff. First row is usually blocked for a reason that I cannot understand. You can read my previous posts on the same issue: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r731932060-EGYPTAIR-World.html

Actual takeoff time was delayed about 10 minutes, which is not bad, and arrival was on time.

A welcome drink was served before takeoff. About 20minutes after takeoff a snack, a small pack of small cookies, and drink were served. Lunch was served halfway through the flight. I got to choose from a menu that had limited but good selection of food. After main course a desert was served. Selection of bread and drinks were offered during and after the meal.

Flying conditions were very nice. It was mostly sunny and no turbulences. The flight arrived to Copenhagen on time with no delay.

In short, Egyptair offered wide and comfortable seats on this flight and served yummy meal. Staff are very friendly and polite.

"I was a bit hesitent about booking with Egyptair initially but needen't have worried.
Booked all the flights online with Egyptair themselves and the process was just as easy as any other airline. Booked flight to Cairo, then a seperate flight to Luxor and then a return fight from Aswan to Heathrow via Cairo and it was very easy to package everything together.
The flight out to Cairo was very comfortable in the normal economy seating. The flight back was on a much smaller aircraft and felt more like an economy service than a regular flight. Bit disappointed there. Certainly not as comfortable.
The internal flights were all fine and as you might expect.
Although it's a rather tortuous process to get a visa in advance it might be worth it as it's a real ""bun fight"" to go through the process at Cairo airport.
It's worth noting that no alcohol is served on Egyptair flights but the food is fine and soft drinks may be had at any time.
On-board entertainment is good with recent released films as well as a quantity of others. Headphones are supplied.
If you book economy you might find that your ticked is listed as ""restricted"" but don't panic. On the international flights you're allowed two checked bags but on the internals, only one. So you could still do the main journey with 2 checked bags but you then have the problem of what to do with one when you travel on.
Overall our experience with Egyptair was Good and I'd have no trouble flying with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveofTellus,David J wrote a review Mar 2020,David J,"Dursley, United Kingdom",64 contributions,11 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r749237808-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good way to travel to Egypt,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I was worried that he would have issues because after I bought the ticket,  I then seen on the website that the credit card holder had to be one of the travelers on the flight and that Egyptair had the right to refuse the traveler boarding if they could not present the card the ticket was purchased with. I called Egyptair and explained the situation to them. The rep told me to make a copy of the front and back of my card & driver license and to write underneath that I was the owner of the card used to purchase the ticket and I authorized the use.

"I was really happy with this trip on EgyptAir because everything was smooth-sailing, from start to finish. This was a refreshing change from the previous flight that had taken me to Cairo, (but that's a whole nother peculiar experience! 😄). Check-in was fast and there were no delays. I think we took off at exactly 9:30 a.m, with boarding commencing at approximately 9:00 a.m prompt. In fact, by the time I arrived at the gate, (9:10 a.mish), boarding was complete! I think I was the second to the last person to board the plane.

One of the crew told me it was a Boeing 737-800 plane when I asked. Hallelujah that this type of plane has a T.V!!! 👏💃🏾The series of planes that fly to and from this itinerary almost always never have a T.V, so I was quite chuffed that I would get to enjoy some in-flight entertainment! The seats are unfortunately the ones that don't convert to 'bed-like' flatness. They just recline back a little, but the seats are comfortable nevertheless. This, and the fact that no food menu was provided, were the only issues I had with this particular flight. Apart from this, I had no problems on Egypt Air this time around.

The food was very impressive. A yummy shrimp, dill, lemon and cherry tomato appetizer was served on a bed of greens. A nice cheese selection, (3 types) came with an apricot and de-seeded prune. The salad, (with a 1,000 island dressing pack) had quinoa, sundried peppers, cheese, cucumbers, walnuts, cherry tomatoes and crisp iceberg lettuce. It reminded me of, and tasted like a Waldorf salad- which I absolutely love. For the mains, it was a choice between shrimps with fettuccine pasta, lamb chops with mashed potatoes & vegetables and chicken with rice. Since I had had chicken on my last trip and I had had my fill of pasta in Cairo, I decided to go for the lamb chops. Besides, I hadn't had chops in a while. They tasted amazing! Cooked to perfection and glazed with a hearty and robust rosemary flavoured gravy. The chops went so well with the roasted carrots, eggplant, marrow and creamy mashed potatoes. This is easily one of the best meals I've ever had on EgyptAir! 😋

For dessert, it was a choice between what looked like a plain New York cheesecake and a strawberry tart, plus a selection of exotic fruits and of course, tea and coffee. I went for the tart, because it looked so appealing, and it did not disappoint at all! The pastry was excellent, and the dainty treat had all the 'custardy' goodness that I love about tarts. The toilet was very clean. Service was also really good on this flight. All of the staff did a great job, but most notably, GHIAN GAMAL was excellent. I've had lackluster experiences in the past, (to say the least) with EgyptAir's service on business class, including, but not limited to a stewardess removing all her clothes and changing on a seat across from me, to another sleeping on the floor, and hence obstructing the aisle, etc; but this time around, everything was on point! They seemed to be very interested in the quality of the service because 2 air hostesses came to me with a clipboard and asked about the service on the flight, to which I gave them very positive feedback. I hope all my future flights on EgyptAir will be this enjoyable. This makes me look forward to flying with them again. Kudos to all the staff for providing awesome service on this flight. Keep up the awesome job and PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, endeavor to maintain this very impressive standard!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/a5/0d/fd/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaijaBabe2016,Naija Babe 2016 wrote a review Feb 2020,Naija Babe 2016,Nigeria,3669 contributions,176 helpful votes,Cairo - Kano,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r747552890-EGYPTAIR-World.html,A significant improvement from my last trip! 👍🏽,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My trip didn't start well at Amsterdam due to some confusion as to which lounge I was allowed into. The KLM Crown lounge 52 sent me to the Aspire lounge 41. They then sent me back to the KLM Crown lounge who then sent me back to lounge 41 before they agreed to let me in.
On boarding the plane I found what were to be the worst business class seats I have ever had. They are not electrically adjustable and several did not recline. I couldn't get the footrest to extend, but neither could anybody else. At least it was only a 5 hour flight.
You get a welcome drink (no alcohol) and hot towel. Once the seat belt signs had gone off and the screens unlocked to the movies I went through the selection and only found a couple that looked interesting. There were many I had never heard of. Again, at least it was only a 5 hour flight.
Dinner consisted of 5 courses: a salad, starter, main, cheese selection and dessert. The main was meant to be chicken, but didn't appear to be any part of a chicken I recognised. It was ok and I finished everything as I had not had lunch.
On landing, I saw passengers recline their seats, continue to watch movies and even get up to open the lockers! This was right infront of the stewardesses who did not seem bothered by this.
It was quite an experience and one I would not want to repeat anytime soon.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/63/3b/64/damasinnas.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damasinnas,damasinnas wrote a review Feb 2020,damasinnas,"Norwich, United Kingdom",203 contributions,73 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r747370020-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Leaves a lot to be desired,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Seats are old and dirty, hardly recline when not broken, aircraft is an old 737.
Food is bad and no wine, beer or spirits at all.
Boarding has no priority for business class. Pre-boarding means you stay an hour in a boarding room. No WiFi in terminal.
Toilets are disgusting with urine on seat, floor AND walls.
Pillows had old pillow cases on. I had to cover mine with a t-Shirt. In flight entertainment is very limited.
Business lounge in Cairo is a joke. Still no drink (and this applies to all airlines), food looks like you should stay away from it. Seats and floors are old and dirty.
I will never fly Egypt Air again. My Turkish airline fight was canceled last minute and Egypt Air was the only airline to get me to destination on time, which meant arriving in the middle of the night. Flights leaving just slightly later (but too late for me) with KLM, Kenyan Airways or Ethiopian were all cheaper.

"I should start by being fair as this was only my second business class flight on EgyptAir. The first occurred 3 weeks ago flying from Toronto to Cairo. If I was to review the first flight I’d give it 3/5 only because l got what I expected for the price I paid! But then came flight 2! I wish I could have given 0 stars!! Check in was a mess even on business “ gold track”; one hour before we were in our seats. The plane was a 777 and they had only 2 scanners. But let’s for fun not blame them rather the airport; if only I could. As I sat down in 15 A and C and our companions in 14 A and C we were visited by Ms cranky pants (CP from now on) who angrily it appeared , offered juice and her mood worsened if her tray didn’t have the kind you wanted. The remote didn’t work, table not clean, servers almost invisible, food horrible because for BOTH dinner and breakfast they ran out of choices of meal ( leaving an almost inedible something)and even at breakfast ran out of that rarest of juices , orange. The bathroom had NO PAPER of ANY kind in it 2 hrs prior to landing; a whole other story. CP was angered when my wife asked for extra milk in her coffee and when she returned frowned as I requested a refill but she had to go back and get the pot. In her frustration she knocked my cutlery on to the floor then picked it up and dropped it on my unfinished plate of food. Mind you then I had another reason not to eat it. The entertainment selection of movies was horrendous by any standard. The pretty close to lie flat bed did afford some restful sleep on the 12 hr flight when the 2 children seated across the aisle weren’t running around unfettered. I suppose the parents are more to blame than EgyptAir. Departure from the plane went smoothly. Well done EgyptAir :( I hope this was a one off as some on the flight looked like they enjoyed their job and cared. CP may have lost her dog that day ; who knows.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898lauria,Lauri A wrote a review Feb 2020,Lauri A,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 contributions,5 helpful votes,Cairo - Toronto,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r745683228-EGYPTAIR-World.html,What a disappointment ,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I arrived to Sharm El Sheikh abut 2 hours ahead of my afternoon flight (MS306). After I passed the security check and checked in my small suite case, I headed to the business class Lounge. I was very disappointed as the receptionist told me that being an Egypt Air traveler I am not entitled to access to the lounge. I was told I have to pay 750 Egyptian pounds in order to gain access. I decided I will skip the lounge as I had about an hour for boarding. I thought it is not good value for money.

My seat 20K is a window seat in the first raw of the small Embraer 170. The flight was full. We were served ready packaged juice as welcome drink. A modest meal of 2 small bite size cheese and salmon sandwiches, cake, cold and/or hot drinks were served after about 10 minutes of takeoff. The flight duration to Cairo Airport was 44 minutes.

In short, this flight was a very short flight in a small commercial jet that was almost full. Business class seats are small. Given that and with no access to the lounge I do not think that traveling business class under these conditions would be very good value for money, but if you can afford it why not. I have to mention that business class passengers were given priority upon arrival as we boarded a separate buss to the terminal before the economy class passengers, but we had to wait about 15 minutes for the luggage anyway.

"Arrived at Nairobi Airport to take flight MS850 to Cairo and when I was going to check-in, they informed me that my ticket was cancelled. Why? They did not tell me.

Hours before checking-in, I called the Nairobi Egyptair line, and they told me that I had my ticket confirmed and should show on the airport for check in. I also received Egyptair’s e-mail regarding my booking.

When I asked Check-in agents for a customer service number for Egyptair to solve my issue, they did not give me any number, moreover they did not have an Egyptair office in the airport who could assist us with my situation.

When I asked if I was able to purchase a new ticket, they told me it was possible but I only had 45 min to decide. Once I told them that I wanted to buy a new ticket, they told me that it was not possible and they only accepted cash. Check-in agents showed no empathy to my problem and their only answer was “we don’t know, call your agent.”

I showed them proof that I have received an e-mail confirming my reservation, and they said it was cancelled and could not board the plane.

After trying to reach Egyptair phone number for customer service on their website, the numbers provided did not work. 5 hours later after trying to call 50 different phone numbers that are listed in their website, I was able to get connected with a phone number in Abbu Dhabi.

+97144358444 this phone works.

Their phone service was cold and did not accept any responsibility on their mistake and only blamed AIR CANADA(Agent who issued ticket)

I asked for more juice and she brought it.Comparing to the second airline I flew with, the plane was relatively clean.Remember, the economic situation in Egypt is far from being good . I guess it isn't the airlines fault , but be aware that I  took 4 flights during my 6 nights tour in Egypt (TLV-CAI-LUX/ASW-CAI-TLV), all of them were late to took of in an hour or even more.

"It wasn't a great trip. Unfortunaetly I reserved a place just beside the exit and I didn't know about it it because exit doors was not clear in the plane chart when I reserved.
The seats beside exits of course is so narrow,no room for leg and can not be bent. The other problem is that there was a couple sitting infront of us who was bending their chairs so it was really tight. when we told the hostess she said sorry but I can't do anything, when you reserved it was shown that those seats are beside the exit door so I said no and if I have known, probably I wouldn't have reserved them.

"I flew Egyptair as part of a luxury package holiday, and although the holiday itself was wonderful, it was spoiled by the flights. The worst of the 3 flights was the return from luxor. We were delayed and the security, although seemingly repetitive, didnt apply to everyone. I had my bags searched and had to sign a book 3 times whilst people behind me just walked through. The plane was tatty and grubby, and the av didn't work. The food was cold vegetables and on the flight out they didn't have a meal for me at all. The plane was freezing and the staff looked thoroughly miserable. Worst of all the toilets were disgusting. They were not clean to begin and bits were broken. 2 hours into the the flight water was swishing around the floor. On the flight over the tap nearly came off in my hand. For such a wonderful country and a people in desperate need of the return of tourism, egyptair gives them a bad impression.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redshaz23,Redshaz23 wrote a review Feb 2020,Redshaz23,"Heathfield, United Kingdom",35 contributions,18 helpful votes,Luxor - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r742955841-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Will never fly Egyptair again.,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight out to Egypt was on a dirty plane but the airline staff were nice enough, the food was all mixed up and although we asked for chicken we were served beef and when a passenger queried it they were told it was chicken but just dark meet until another member of staff came along and said we had been given the wrong food but too late to change.  The flight back was on a clean plane but to say the airline staff found the passengers an inconvenience is an understatement!

"My sister and I travelled with Egyptair to go to and from Toronto to Cairo this month and it was the absolute worst flying experience we have ever had. We have travelled countless times through out our lives with many other airlines but I could have never imagined prior to booking with Egyptair that we would experience such discomfort and disappointment.

Let me start with the lack of hygiene on the airplane, both to Cairo and back. It was beyond obvious that the airline puts no time or effort in sanitizing the seats or bathrooms prior to take off, as the seats were tainted and smelled very foul of body odour from previous flyers, and the booklets stored in the sleeve in the seats in front of us were sticky and dirty. They do not provide any paper bag or anything of that sort to store your garbage so if you had garbage and needed to store it somewhere your only option was in the sleeve across you. I had required tissues during the flight, and not only did it take forever for the flight attendant to respond to the assistance light I had turned on but it was when I realized the only place available to put any garbage was in the sleeve in front of me I was mortified at the idea of all the built up germs and dirt from previous flyers.

The bathroom. Now it is expected to walk into a horrifyingly dirty bathroom especially during a 12 hour flight, but what blew my mind away is that when we were returning from Cairo to Toronto, there was a delay in boarding and take off and so by the time we got on the plane I needed to relieve myself. My sister and I were one of the first people to board the plane and the flight attendant lock the washroom before take off so I had kindly requested for them to unlock it and they did, and I could not believe what I had walked into. Initially I had thought I was privileged to be the first to use what you would THINK is a clean washroom before a flight, but instead I walked into dry pee literally ALL over the toilet, tissues and dried up God knows what on the counter and floor and soap that you felt you needed to wash your hands after using before the dispenser was dirty and half empty from the previous flight. I wish I had my phone in my pocket at the time because the first thing I thought is Oh God I need to take a video of this but unfortunately I had left it with my sister. In addition to this the seats were so uncomfortable and the tv's are so outdated and not all of them work properly. Even just picking up the remote you can feel how dirty they are, so unacceptable.

This is absolutely unacceptable in my opinion, especially given the fact that there is deadly virus going around right now and just because we are flying economy it doesn't change the fact that we are still paying thousands of dollars to this airline and the very least that they should be able to deliver is acceptable hygiene.

The food. Oh God the food... I have never experienced such a lack of quality in airplane food, especially for a 12 hour flight. Let me include that we had travelled to Egypt for a 5 day transit, then continued to Lebanon on Egyptair where we spent the majority of our stay, and then came back to Cairo for a 5 hour transit before returning to Canada. On the way to Cairo initially, the food was awful. For the main course you pick between chicken or beef and we always feel chicken may be the safer choice. We received half of a very old tasting chicken breast, along side pasta with no sauce that tasted overcooked and like it was boiled in unclean water as it had a strange flavour to it, and a couple of boiled carrots and broccoli that tasted just like the pasta. The buns they provided were so stale and old that I had to really put my tricep into trying to cut it and it was literally crumbling on the inside because of how stale it was. The desert was the only part of the meal that was acceptable and that's because it was very clear they were some commercial brand cake. On the flight to and from Lebanon, being only an hour and half long they serve you a simple sandwich and garden salad, and from Cairo to Lebanon the quality of the bread was acceptable, but I kid you not coming back from Lebanon to Cairo, they had served us the exact same lunch they did on our way to Beirut, except the bread was so stale that we couldn't even eat it. The cucumbers were so old that just by smelling them I knew there's no way I was eating that and both my sister and I were certain that they were serving us whatever was left over from the flight we took 10 days ago. How in the world is that acceptable at all? Even the breakfast that they served us during both 12 hour flight from Toronto to Cairo and back, were so gross that we kept returning our meals as they were served and only eating the stale bread and desert. Imagine eating a rice pudding desert only to witness stains on the bowl you've reached the bottom of... disgusting!!!! This took place on our way back yesterday as there was no commercial desert served that time.

On top of that the I kid you not there were only TWO friendly flight attendants during all 4 flights we took. The rest were mean and so unapproachable that you couldn't help but feel anxious every time you had to communicate with them. Being someone who has travelled countless times in my life, I have never felt so discouraged to communicate a need or request with flight attendants before. They act like you've bothering them or asking for the impossible. From the way they look at you to the way they respond.. where is the customer service??? I can't help wonder is the lack of effort and hygiene and quality all due to the fact that we flew economy? Because I have never experienced such things on any other economy flight I've taken before. I paid thousands of dollars to hold my piss in, skip my meals and sit in B.O. smelling and extremely uncomfortable chairs for 12 hours.

Honestly I am not one to put time or effort into writing such a detailed review and this is my first time spending this much time doing so but that is how shocked and disappointed we were with our experience on Egyptair and I will NEVER EVER do business with Egyptair ever again. I have already warned all of my friends and family not to bother wasting their money on this Airline either.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/481randb,Rand B wrote a review Jan 2020,Rand B,,1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Toronto - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r741775024-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Our first and absolutely last time flying with Egyptair,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Delays and lost luggage all along; below for more details.
Well, this was the first time I ever travelled with Egypt Air. I was super excited to be stopping over in Cairo even if it was just the airport and had good expectations for the airline. My sisters however, weren’t happy at all, given their last experience flying with this carrier.
In Nairobi, our flight was delayed 4-5hours. Obviously we missed our connecting flight to Madrid. So we were put on a flight to Rome from Cairo and then a local Spanish airline to Madrid. (The aircrafts to Cairo and Rome had no televisions, but there was a common television that played Lion king during one sector so that was do-able). Once landed in Madrid, mine and my sisters bag didn’t show. Eventually mine turned up but my sisters didn’t and couldn’t be tracked on the world tracker for 5 days - poor thing had all her winter stuff in that bag and we went straight from Hot to cold weather. The bag turned up one week later.
On the way back to Nairobi from Madrid, our flight was delayed for 45 minutes and almost missed our connecting flight to Nairobi. Once landed in Cairo, we were given the wrong gate number; after rushing to this gate, we literally ran across the airport to the right gate.
Once landed in Nairobi, my luggage didn’t make it - luckily, it was found 2 days later and was delivered to my preferred address.
My aunt was very familiar with the lost (& damaged) luggage procedure, as it has happened to her and my sister on their previous trip to Amsterdam via Egypt air.

The service is somewhat good, so is the food. The seats aren’t the worst and I found this aircraft to have slightly more leg room compared to the other carriers I’ve flown with.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaaira,Shaira M wrote a review Jan 2020,Shaira M,,7 contributions,13 helpful votes,Nairobi - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r740651410-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Oh man ...,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Such an awful airline. Booked some tickets for work with Egyptair because it was very good priced. Well, so much for being cheapskate. What a terrible airline. The food was awful, planes just grimy. As for the staff - ranging from very unprofessional to just plainly rude. On one of the last flights i flew AMS-CAI and had two pilots on the other side of the aisle on row 1. I asked them if they would not have to stow their bagage since they were seated on row 1. In response the pilot mentioned ""just like when you went to get something out of your backpack when the belts-on-light was still swithched on?"". Sooooo incredibly rude but then again with an airline such as this I just regard upon this as being part of the game.

"I've flown EgyptAir many a time, but never got to write a review till now. This particular flight was delayed due to so much fog, which made visibility terrible, so the plane couldn't land. They landed in another city and returned later in the evening, so we took off the following day. This is a short haul flight, so the seats on the plane don't convert to bed-like positions because of the type of plane. Since I've flown EgyptAir more than I can count, this time around, service wasn't good at all. And to top it all off, there was a lot of turbulence, so it interrupted the flow of things. The crew forgot to serve drinks and water! The food was bland and boring. I picked the fish as my main, (from a chicken and beef option), and got served a meal with frozen rice! This is understandable given what happened with the delay of the flight due to unforeseen circumstances, so the food must have been kept overnight in the freezer, thawed and reheated on the day of our flight. The crew lady did exchange my plate with another dish which was hot. The dessert was also nothing to write home about; a dry and tasteless mass of fluff pretending to be a chocolate cake. Like I said, I've had far better experiences on EgyptAir, but this flight was bad on so many levels. I'll continue to fly EgyptAir because I know that all the aspects of this flight that were negative can sometimes be a lot better than what I experienced this time around.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/a5/0d/fd/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaijaBabe2016,Naija Babe 2016 wrote a review Jan 2020,Naija Babe 2016,Nigeria,3669 contributions,176 helpful votes,Kano - Cairo,North Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r740275471-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Delayed flight because of bad weather. ☹,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I fly often and this is one of the worst airlines I have traveled on. Poor service, rude staff, terrible food and an uncomfortable flight. I used this air line three times while in Egypt. Not once did we leave on time. The last flight to London let one and a half hours late with no explanation to passengers and no apologies. It seems to be a matter of course with this airline. Staff were abrupt and at times rude. An unaccompanied child spilled pop in front of us that soaked the floor and when we asked for assistance the flight attendant threw some paper napkins at us and told us to just “deal with it”  Not the child’s fault but some help would have been nice. We were told never to check our luggage withi this airline so we carried on and after hearing from other passengers and their experiences we are glad we did. Egypt is a wonderful country to visit. It’s too bad this airline is its ambassador. It tarnishes a wonderful experience. Time for the CEO of this company to take a good look in the mirror.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8240LEpeterm,Peter M wrote a review Jan 2020,Peter M,"Glacier National Park of Canada, Canada",4 contributions,,Cairo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r740103316-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Stay away,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Whilst the aircraft is perfectly fine, large and maintained, comfortable at exit seat row (except for in-flight entertainment), the service leaves much to be desired. Interior is grimy and dirty however, making you want to disinfect everything around your seat.

We did on-line check-in, as we'd booked and paid for exit seats up front. So all we needed to do was drop our bags at the fast track bag drop queue, right? Wrong....... this queue took nearly two hours to serve 4 people in front of us ""dropping"" bags. Pathetic to say the least. This was at OR Tambo in JHB. The automated bag drops in Munich are WAY faster and better, so the gripe here is more aimed at the lack of tech at OR Tambo (and a little at the slow ground staff employed by Egypt Air in JHB)

So on the topic of in-flight entertainment, almost none of the new release movies to be seen anywhere, it's more a bunch of old movies dating back to the 70's and 80's with a smattering of newer movies (circa early 2000's maybe?), plus a bunch of foreign language films. Egypt air desperately needs to bring their entertainment standards into the 21st century!

Food is dismal, beef that can crack a tooth, chicken drier than the Sahara desert! Can't say much more, except, food is horrible.

The air hostesses all look miserable, as if they don't want to be there. The stewards are all as friendly as Charon taking payment for crossing the river Styx! They bark at you when asking if you want to eat or drink anything, and heaven forbid you ask them for extra water, it all seems such an effort to them. If you choose this job, at least have the interpersonal skills to make your passengers enjoy their uncomfortable, ""stuffed-inside-a-metal-tube-for-9-hours"" experience.

And yes, I know that the staff on board are there primarily as Safety Officers and NOT as waiters and waitresses to heed your every beck and call, but it takes nothing to be pleasant and polite to your passengers. If other airlines can do it, nothing stops Egypt Air from trying to emulate.

We flew Jhb to Cairo and from Cairo had a Lufthansa operated code share to Munich. The staff on board this leg were SO much more pleasant, smiles on faces, engaging with their passengers.

If Lufthansa and even Emirates and Qatar can smile, why can't Egypt Air?

But then if you book the cheapest ticket around, I guess you get what you pay for.

My recommendation - pay a few pennies more and fly with one of the other airlines who at least make an effort.

Waiting at Cairo airport for our return journey home - 2 hour delay standing in the boarding queue, with ground staff standing in front of us, watching us getting more fidgety by the minute and not ONCE having the decency to at least do an announcement as to why there is a delay, to apologise for said delay and to give us a time-frame. They stood there ignoring us completely. Apparently Egypt Air has a reputation for always being delayed, go figure.

Oh and airport security at Cairo! A joke. We left JHB with our rechargeable AA camera batteries and cigarette lighters in our carry-on luggage. Not questioned once about these, as they are part of the ""allowed items"" (I've checked and double checked this subsequently) but must be in carry-on.

Arrived in Cairo for lay-over en route to Munich, all good. When going through security at Cairo to catch the leg from Cairo to Munich, we had to give up our lighters, as these were ""not allowed"" according to staff. We did so, not having much choice in the matter. No issues with the batteries here, please note.

In Munich, obviously bought new lighters. So now cue return flight Munich to Cairo a week later, again went through security with lighters and batteries in carry-on, no issue.

So after our lay-over we find ourselves again at Cairo security check for leg Cairo back to Johannesburg. No surprise, we were asked for the lighters, which we again handed. But here's the kicker, now they suddenly demanded I hand over the rechargeable AA batteries I had loose in my bag PLUS the ones in my camera. When I questioned why, as these were brought into the country and out again en route to Munich, I was met with ""not allowed!""

Now I don't normally fight or put up a scene at airport security, as the last thing I want is to be taken into a room somewhere and subjected to heaven knows what, but this time I was not prepared to have my expensive batteries seized so I simply told the security officer that I was not prepared to relinquish these, that they were expensive rechargeable batteries for my camera. He shrugged, and let me through! What gives? Was this an attempt to score some expensive goods for himself?

Needless to say, arrived back in JHB with my batteries I subsequently also discovered the second lighter I had tucked away still in its packaging, in my carry-on. So much for their security standards!!!

Flew with Egypt Air twice before, once in the early 90's and once in 2009, and both times we had very pleasant flights. However their service standards have worsened since, making me never want to fly them ever again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/5b/3e/00/gmansa.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GmanSA,Gys dB wrote a review Jan 2020,Gys dB,"Midrand, South Africa",137 contributions,61 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Munich,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r740031324-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Horrible service and bad food,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The online check-in, ticket booking and payment process are a mess. I'd recommend a different airline to be in the safe side. Below you can find more details.

Keep in mind I'm not a frequent traveler with them (twice per year), therefore, it's quite astonishing that I alone encounter these issues.

Here's my latest problem:
Nowhere on my ticket does it say how many pieces of luggage I'm allowed on board (apparently, you see it once when booking the flight which happens months in advance), but I like to be on the safe side and called several times to make sure with the customer service on the phone, in which 2 times I was assured that I'll be allowed 2 pieces. I call for the third time on the night before the flight, after having bought all of the stuff that I can use for the second piece of luggage, to be told that I am only allowed 1 piece and the second piece will cost me around 100 euros. I'd like to empathize again that nowhere on the ticket (and I'm already checked in) does it say how many pieces I am allowed, only that I need to contact them to ask.
Like I said above, safe yourself the trouble, and just go with a different airline.

I had another incident in which it was not accepting my Egyptian passport details because of a bug on their booking system, which always gave me a very clear feedback that my ticket was consequently not booked, only to discover later by my bank that I had made 3 purchases with the same details, which means I triple booked the ticket that was always giving me an error.

Another time, me and a friend (German passport holder) couldn't manage to do online check-in, which means you have to wait more than an hour in line until you can reach the counter to perform check-in before the flight. Yes, more than an hour!

Your luggage gets broken, but I guess that is expected, so I don't need to add more here.

I once didn't find place for my carry-on luggage (because they didn't regulate the carry-on specifications for the rest of the passengers), and had to give my stuff to be divided randomly somewhere on the plane.

Again, I can't stress this enough, it's not worth it with all the hassle that you might encounter.

The Dreamliner has the business class pods with the fully reclining seats. The enclosure has lots of room and a USB port in addition to a power socket. A pillow and plush blanket were provided as well as headphones.

When i asked the crews about the sound, they said it is normal because the aircraft is overloaded with passengers and their luggage.I was under the shock because we talk about 10 hours flight from Bangkok to Cairo flight and then 4 hours from Cairo to Tunisia.

"Many of my friends (and online reviews) had warned me that flying with EgyptAir is a mistake. Based on their own experiences, some of my friends laughed when I told them who I was flying with and said ""You might get there in one piece, but your luggage probably won't"" or, ""Add at least a day to your expected arrival date- you'll definitely miss your connection"". I naively thought that everything would be okay, we couldn't all have such bad luck. My error, of course, was assuming that the poor experiences of my peers with EgyptAir were anomalies and not (largely) unbroken rules.

In the interest of fairness, I will attempt to begin with the most positive elements of my trip. After thinking for a long time I have come up with 3.
1. The seats were similar to other airline seats - they were very standard seats of an economy class budget airline.
2. The food tasted like airplane food. (On the menu was a miscellaneous brown meat, which the crew optimistically referred to as 'chicken'). My expectations were low here, so I could not be disappointed.
3. I arrived at the destination eventually (albeit 26 hours later than intended).

- No alcohol served on the flight to take the edge off what will inevitably be a terrible experience: instead, they have warm fizzy drinks and juice, many of which ran out quickly.

- The second leg of the flight (Cairo to Nairobi) had no personal inflight entertainment. The safety announcement was shown on overhead screens and was difficult to hear.

On my first flight (Heathrow to Cairo) the cabin crew were reluctant to help with requests. After realising that the 'call' button, had absolutely no effect on the crew, I quickly learned to walk to the end of the cabin for any assistance. The cabin was freezing cold, and when I asked the crew for a blanket, I was told, with a snigger that EgyptAir does not stock enough blankets for everybody on the flight. Though I find it odd that for a fairly late and cold flight, they only have a few blankets, I take more issue with the fact that I was spoken down to for even having the audacity to ask.

There was absolutely no communication on the flight that there had been a delay on the first flight that would mean that some of the passengers would miss the second flight. When the plane arrived, I was not aware that there had been a delay. It would have been so simple for the crew, in the knowledge that there were passengers that would be missing connecting flights, to have announced that there was a delay. I was so stunned by the lack of communication, that I checked my clock 4 times before fully comprehending that my connecting flight would be boarding. A large part of me assumed that perhaps I was confused about the timezone. Expecting a higher level of customer service, in my naivety I still assumed that the airline would not close the connection without communicating something. When running to the gate, I was met by an Egyptair representative who somewhat helpfully (though not entirely in an organised way) was calling out to the crowd “connections to Nairobi?” He then asked me to follow him. We stopped several times for him to speak in Arabic and shake hands with airport staff. I had to ask repeatedly what was going on before finally being told with a casual and broad smile, that I had missed my flight. I was left as a single young woman in Egypt, surrounded by people who were not speaking English to me or explaining what was going on. I felt completely vulnerable.

When I reached the ‘missed connections’ desk, to my relief I was informed that I could stay in 5* accommodation in Cairo for 24 hours. However, the on ground crew were rude, and aggressive-mannered and once again gave very little clear communication throughout. After waiting for around five long hours (including a 20 minute wait outside in the dark, alone) our shuttle bus finally arrived at the airport to take us to Novotel Cairo hotel. Following a long wait at the hotel reception, we were escorted to our hotel rooms. My room had dirty tissues strewn across an unmade bed, and dirty coffee cups on the side. I had not hoped for Egyptair to provide luxury, but I had expected a clean and safe room. Whilst at reception later, I met a woman who asked me what room I was in since she had been given the key of my fellow passenger. Upon realising that they had the same room, this woman handed back her key; but somebody else may have not been so honest. This was an extreme breach of safety, leaving us feeling even more vulnerable. I informed the hotel of the untidy room, and was thankfully moved to another room after a wait. However, on arrival in the second room, I discovered that the bathroom floor was covered in pubic hairs. I was absolutely destroyed by tiredness by this point, and keen to avoid moving yet again, in the full knowledge that I would have to try and get some work done the following day. However, if there was such visible human filth, I was uncomfortable sleeping on the probably equally unclean sheets. After over 30 minutes, I was finally moved again and able to sleep. The next day, I checked under the bed to see if I had forgotten anything and discovered that under the bed was absolutely covered with balls of dust. So, yes- if you miss your connection in Cairo, you will be provided with a hotel room and below average meals but don't expect safety or cleanliness.

When I arrived back at the airport, we were moved between five different desks before finally being given our passports back. Once again, there was no respect, no politeness, no communication.

Once through passport control, I asked at the “PR desk” if it was possible to claim compensation and what my rights were. I was told, with a smirk that I had no rights to anything.

I have not ever made a public complaint like this before but in this case I think it is necessary. I urge you to either lower your expectations significantly when flying EgyptAir- or spend a little bit more money on another airline to ensure that you are safe and well-cared for on your flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UKtraveller202,UKtraveller202 wrote a review Jan 2020,UKtraveller202,,1 contribution,,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r737900277-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Do not fly EgyptAir!

"We planned an awesome vacation to Egypt for people on one confirmation code/itinerary. I would typically have flown a US mainline carrier like Delta but instead I was convinced by one of the party to use Egypt Air because of the non-stop from IAD versus a layover if flying from our preferred DCA. NEVER AGAIN.

I bought the tickets through Expedia. Four of us were traveling together. I created a login on the EgyptAir website so that I could select our seats. I also joined their frequent flyer program. The separate websites weren't that great but not the worst. I was able to figure it out. I selected seats for the four of us for both legs (going to Cairo and returning). It is a 10 hour flight there and a 12 hour flight back. The hassle of creating id's on their site to select seats together was worth the effort. i selected window and middle seats on neighboring rows going and coming. The plan is a 3-3-3 configuration. I get the checkin email a day before the flight. I discover that EgyptAir as reassigned us to two rows in the middle seat of 3 seats farther back in the plane. No notice, nothing. Completely overrode the seats I selected over a month in advance. There were no other seat selection options available at this point. Needless to say, the same thing happened on the way back. Except this time one of us was put in a middle seat on one side and the other 3 in a middle set of 3. Absolute disregard for the fact that we went through the hassle of selecting seats in advance via their website.

Let's talk about the in-flight service. There's not much to talk about because it was mostly non-existent. The crew acted as if they had a checklist of things do do, checked them off, and spent the rest of the time lounging in the back chatting. I honestly felt like they didn't want us to hydrate so we wouldn't be up and about. For a 10 and 12 hour flight they service a meal that comes with a small foil covered cup of maybe 5 oz of water and they offer another drink,in another very small cup, maybe 6 oz of water/soda/juice. Then again on the end of the trip. Does this airline not understand the basics of keeping passengers hydrated on long trips?? On standard carriers I'm used to walking in and being handed a big bottle of water for a shorter trip to Europe - PLUS they come through the aisles often with more fluids. We were offered maybe half a bottle of water on the whole 10/12 hour flight. On the way back we planned to buy a bigger bottle to take on with us - NOPE! The boarding gate is in an extra-secure area that doesn't allow liquids through security with no shops to buy more.

A final note, on the way there it look like someone had spilled water (I hope it was just water) in the bathroom shortly after take off. So much so that it pooled along the wall. The entire floor was wet. It stayed that way the entire flight - I guess the water seeped out but no one ever took time to clean the floor.

The food itself was ok. Fairly standard. It was economy so I didn't have high expectations of food quantity. Obviously, water quantity on a long-haul flight was a major issue.

I haven't had such a bad experience on a flight in a long time. Probably the first time I've ever taken the time to review an airline. Thankfully one of our party is Star Alliance Gold so we were able to board early. I'm Sky Team Platinum myself. This experience certainly tells me that Star Alliance has little regard for providing consistent quality.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herschelc2018,Herschel C wrote a review Jan 2020,Herschel C,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",8 contributions,7 helpful votes,Washington DC - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r737846160-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"No regard for customer service - horrible, long flight.

"I don't even know where to start.. our flight was delayed an hour and then when we finally got on the plane they had us wait before take off for and hour and a half ..and didn't tell us what was going on, we were so panicked that we were going to miss our next flight it was insane..the food was not bad.. obviously chicken/beef option (I wish I could roll my eyes in this review) The seats were horrible getting on the plane was a mission.

Our seats didn't work at all they couldn't go down they were stuck, so we asked the staff to help us to adjust them. And she looked at the seat said no sorry it's stuck and we had to sit in an upright position for 9 something hours.. and avoided us for the rest of the flight.

If you have to fly with EgyptAir please also be sure not to stop over at Cairo for a transit flight.. what a disaster we felt so unsafe.. the ladies cleaning the bathrooms were terrifying.. asked us for money and were trying to look in our backpacks and tried to take them so ofcourse we tried to avoid the bathrooms and cleaning ladies.. fun ... This is only the half of it. If you are going to fly with EgyptAir or if you stop over in Cairo... GOOD LUCK!!!

"When you review an airline I guess you can not just review after 1 flight. So now after 4 times BRU/CAI/BKK/CAI/BRU i guess can give a fair review. Over all price /quality it is my preferred carrier. Their frequent flyer program is very interesting/ fast gold status and at least 200% miles flown distance in business class.Out of the 16 flights there was 1 flight when experiencing the flight crew not that friendly,  but all the other 15 flights staff was utmost friendly and helpful!  Very happy with their service. Inflight meals were on all flights good, ok, not 5 * but for me they were certainly ok! On time ? Not really...but never got a delay of over an hour, so for me it's really acceptable. Lounges in Cairo,  they were below expectations,  unfortunately.  Staff are friendly but the food on display is just a 1 on the scale of 10. Customers service, hard to reach. But after all, most important for me is the flights...and they were all fantastic.

Check in at departure lounge was quite disturbing as the main officer checking in didn't even know which barcode to scan until I had to point out his ignorance.
The entertainment available for a 6 hour flight was shockingly limited with overhead TV monitors dropping down that seem so outdated and archaic ! Only two movies were shown and one had to view it whether you liked it or not. The sound was very scratchy due the loose socket connections on the arm rests.

"I had ordered a Indian Veg meal - The meal was nothing short of pathetic. Rice with dry boiled vegetables. How do you expect and Indian to eat rice without gravy ? All airlines need to really understand the taste of there customers and serve food accordingly. For Mumbai to Cairo the majority of the travellers were Indian and the food should have been organised accordingly.

The flight had no inflight entertainment. How do you expect the customers to pass 6-7 hours ?

On the onward flight from Mumbai to Cairo they had given used blankets. They were not even sterilised and packed in sealed packets which is the norm.

No liquor was served - On Intl flight certainly a big thing.

No charging points - should be standard with the current state of mobile phones.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/ea/4c/57/vishal-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258vishalg,Vishal G wrote a review Dec 2019,Vishal G,"Bengaluru, India",16 contributions,12 helpful votes,Cairo - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r734928371-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Best to Avoid Egyptair,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My family bought cheap tickets we very much regret.

- So many EgyptAir staff were aggressively rude to us, we were baffled and lost count. Eg I was flying economy, and as a star alliance gold member, I can check in at the business counter and get priority tags on my luggage. The check-in agent kept demanding to know WHY I wanted priority tags. To get our bags our first. WHY! So we can get through customs and immigration quickly. WHY! ...what?

- Customer service doesn’t pick up the phone or answer email. Multiple times we’ve waited on the phone for literally hours—only to have the line cut off. My sister couldn’t come and her ticket was supposedly refundable, but you can’t get a refund if they won’t communicate with you.

- They lost my bag two weeks ago. When they called for more information, I asked if they had found my bag and the agent yelled, “WE HAVE CALLED YOU MANY MANY MANY MANY TIMES! YOUR PHONE IS BROKEN!” Neither is true, why would anyone say that? My insurance claim requires a note from EgyptAir, but they do not respond.

- On our Nairobi-Cairo leg (5 hours), the passenger behind my parents was violently ill and kept throwing up. The flight attendants were so disgusted they refused to touch the bags and left them on the floor the whole rude, wafting the vomit stench through the plane.

"We were a group of five couples who flew from India to Egypt
We had a confirmed booking for 18/12/2019 from Cairo to Aswan by flight MS391 0700am. Were at checkin counter at 0540to 0550 & after issuing boarding passes to two couples they realised that they had over bookings & made us scape goats & bumped us.
They did not follow the basic rules of bumping that first they should call if anyone would be voluntarily interested, a group should not be bumped, a family should not be bumped. All our explanations were of no use. For 0700 flight they gave us 1425 flight and offered us 40$ per head as compensations.

"Copenhagen-Cairo flight, December 9th, 2019

Flight summary:

Carrier: Egypt air
Equipment: Airbus 320-200
Flight number: MS760
Destination: Cairo
Origin: Copenhagen
Duration: 4hours 15 minutes
Class: C-business class

Seating:
2+2 wide seats
Seat 9A

Staff: Very friendly and helpful from the start to the end of the flight.

Food and drinks: we were served a welcome drink before take-off. Preparation for dinner started after 1 hour after takeoff. Started with serving juice, then appetizers and finally the main course. I was offered one of three choices; pasta with fish, oven baked chicken with rice or beef stew with rice. I chose chicken. Rice had a very plain taste. It could use some spices, but chicken tasted good. Food portion was big, so if you are a big eater the food will be more than enough. Coffee, tea and soft drinks were offered. Fresh fruits were also served and I chose chocolate mousse for desert. One hour and a half before landing, we were served some muffins and offered drinks.

On the negative side: I requested to move to a seat in the first raw. I was informed that these seats were blocked and subject to availability. Then air hostess informed me later that deadhead crew will occupy these seats. For me I thought that I should be given priority over deadhead.

There was quite a number of them on the flight. Imagine about 7 of them in the front galley, where only two are usually there, which limited access to the toilet.

Personally, I felt that they moved freely and actively in the business class area which was somehow disturbing.

Seats had no individual monitors. Movies were displayed on ceiling hanging units. Even then the quality of the movie shown was very poor.

One more thing, toilet was not in the best condition. It seemed old, the toilet seat was loose. Toilet and toilet sink were stained, looked like coffee stain to me. Whether it is coffee stain or not it should look clean.

In conclusion, I flew Austrian airlines, Swiss air, Lufthansa, KLM and Turkish airlines in business class to Cairo and I can say that Egypt air is better than some of the European Airlines. It was a good experience and I enjoyed my flight.

This review is based on my own personal experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140salahf,Salah Farag wrote a review Dec 2019,Salah Farag,"Umeå, Sweden",122 contributions,50 helpful votes,Copenhagen - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r731932060-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Enjoyable business class experience,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Cairo airport has so tight security that you go through the same checks (bags, shoes, belts) with 30m of each other. Savvy travellers know not to put things back but as first-time travellers to Cairo, we went through this rigmarole each time we went through Cairo. I am grateful for this security but within 30m of each checkpoint?

We travelled as a tour group and all of us were seated separately from our spouses/travelling partners even though we checked in together. However, it did give us the opportunity to get to know other tour members.

We did a Cairo-Luxor, Aswan-Abu-Simbel and Cairo-Amman on Egypt Air. As flights were short, we were given a small snack (biscuits) and a drink. Leg room was tight.

All flights left and arrived on time.

"What a disappointment to fly with Egypt AirCounting connecting flights, we had 4 flights with Egypt Air. Not one of our flights departed on time.  All our flights departed between 45 minutes and an hour late.  Toilets on all the flights were disgusting to say the least!Male staff on the flights back from Amsterdam to Johannesburg were unfriendly and it felt like they had this attitude that they were doing you a favour to serve you.  Female staff was much more helpful even though they also did not overflow with friendlyness.  Our long haul flight back was awful, the plane was so old that it still had ashtrays in the arm rests of the seats.  There was no individual entertainment screens, the plane only had a few screens all over, the only on board film was Dumbo.  There was no other entertainment on board..The food was OK.By choice, we will never fly Egypt air again..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prente,Prente wrote a review Dec 2019,Prente,,7 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r731856192-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst flights we ever had,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"EgyptAir has struggled a lot since 2011. 2018 was their first year to not make loss. They have even and still even updating their fleet. I flew from Frankfurt in one of their B787 which is in an amazing configuration and considering that EgyptAir has this all aisle access in business class. The food was good and the stewards did their job to the point. Unfortunately we had some delay during our approach to Cairo. Never mind I made it to my next flight to Dubai which was on an 8 year old A330-300. This aircraft shows its age but still flies like a babe. The service on this flight was even better and we arrived to Dubai 20 minutes ahead of our time.
I can recommend EgyptAir recently
They still got some issues regarding the massive security but I can understand these procedures after they had some bad records in the past years with terrorist attacks emerging to and from Egypt.
At the end the security is made for the passengers safety and of we know what to pack everything will be more than fine.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbF5431PD,M B wrote a review Dec 2019,M B,"Duisburg, Germany",19 contributions,5 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r730912786-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Positive Rate Climb,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew business class on this air line and didn't enjoy my experience. It started with security at the airport which will anger you. Egypt air have flagged 90% of the flight as random check (SSSS) on boarding passes. We can clearly all see that they are just doing a 100% inspection. in security you are supposed to go through steps that filter out candidates so that not everyone goes through a lengthy process but not with these cats. The first guy interrogated me very aggressively as if I am a suspect at a police station and he knows that I am guilty but he just wants to catch me lie and I am a US citizen flying home to the US!. Very disrespectful approach. Then from there we waited for an hour in line which was poorly managed. Several agents went through our bags using the wipes for chemicals detection and even would open the laptops to check. It truly was hilarious. Then other stations would again go through the bag and hold items out to feel them which disorganizes things for you just in case you enjoy repacking. This is already after the bags got X-Rayed and after every passenger went through both the metal detector and the millimeter wave scanners. Which makes you wonder what was the point of the questioning if you were going through everything anyway! From there the flight left 45 minutes late because of security. Now they may claim that this is not Egypt Air's problem but it actually is, because both the security and Egypt Air belong to the same pocket. I don't have to fly out of Cairo. If you want the transit business then you need to improve security services. So Security gets F-.
The air hostesses on the plane were fantastic. They were kind and attentive. They get an A+. The pilot however gets an F because we left 45 minutes late and arrived 45 minutes late. I have never met a pilot that can't make up the difference over a 12 hour flight. Except apparently this guy. This will affect you if you have connections.
The food on the plane gets a B. Not quite on par with Emirates or Qatar airways but better than the American airlines. The plane actually is good but there seems to be an AC problem. I struggled to sleep on the plane and was sweating. If you are a woman this will not bother you but for men I think it is hot. So B+ for the plane. For me I am not sure about this airline. It can be better if they can fix some of these issues. But for me overall it is so-so and not worth it just for the security process.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LordAwesome,LordAwesome wrote a review Dec 2019,LordAwesome,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2 contributions,4 helpful votes,Cairo - Washington DC,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r730719185-EGYPTAIR-World.html,A mixed bag with terrible security processes,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We arrived in cairo at 1.30 am in the morning, restless . Our next flight to Washington DC wiould be in 22 hours later. We expected that we would get a free hotel, had a good sleep and warm shower at a hotel.
But NO, we did not get any free accommodation nor any help to arrange a hotel.
The ground staffs were very root, arrogant and showed no interest to help at all!!
Right after I bought the ticket, I called Egypt air and asked about the free hotel, the employee who received my call said that We will received a free hotel during our transit. Based on that conversation I didn’t make any hotel reservation for our stop over in Cairo.

We traveled a lot with different airlines, such as Turkish airlines, Emirates and Maroccon airlines,they gave us free hotel when the stop over more than 8 hours and their ground staff were always respectful and helpful. Totally different from Egypt air ground staff in Cairo!!

"Flight from IAD to Cairo offers good pricing and very convenient direct service. Our experience on Egypt air flight is over all fair to good. The only disappointing point is the cabin crews' attitude and their poor customer service' skills. They look exhausted , are lacking a smile on their face and are blunt in their offerings. Even if you try to say ""Thank you"", they rarely respond or welcome your compliments. They show up for meals and they threw the snacks on you while you are sleeping. Through a 12 hours flight from Cairo to IAD, they never walk with water or drinks except in the 2 meals or the mid-flight snack. If you walk to the back of the flight to ask for water they point it to you to fill it while they are sitting. Overall they make you feel guilty if you ask for something. Lastly, I have collected the trash in a small paper bag from our seats and waited for them to come around but no body did, as I asked one of the crew to take it, she respond with "" keep it on your seat for now"". I hope see some attitude improvement on future flight!.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/830samehy,sameh Y wrote a review Nov 2019,sameh Y,"Cairo, Egypt",7 contributions,11 helpful votes,Washington DC - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r729800965-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Convenient schedule but poor on board service.,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Since this was a long flight (Toronto to Cairo) we decided to upgrade to Business Class.
The good news was the seats went almost flat so sleeping was an option. The bad news was the in-flight entertainment was from the eighties. No recent movies. The food was mediocre and this airline does not serve booze, ie. it is dry. Fortunately, I had read that you could bring on board your own bottle of wine and the flight attendant was provide a glass (albeit not a wine glass) if asked. This turned out to be correct on both the out bound and in bound legs. Service was attentive but only slightly above average for business class. We tried both business class lounges in the Cairo airport and both were barely acceptable.

Second,
Food was horrible
Third,

Since there are not fully booked, we don't have choice to switch the seats because their cabin crews want to stay in business class to sleep well, what the hell?
They arrange at least 5~6 pilots and cabin crews to occupy business class space for their own self?! which means before I book business class seats,, 5-6 seats always being booked by Egypt air.

"Toronto-Cairo (Oct 28), Cairo-Toronto (Nov 9) on Boeing 777-300ER: very long non stop flights (over 11 hours), Economy felt very cramped, planes were full which surprised us given time of year, food was not great, exception was breakfast on both flights, lounge in Cairo was about 5 degrees Celsius and we were delayed leaving so hundreds froze for over and hour before being able to board the plane.

"Booked with egyptair through a package nile cruise. Plane had delay and was old and tatty. First freezing cold, then horribly hot. Scruffiest flight attendants I have ever seen. Entertainment not worth bothering with- get what you are given film on tiny screens followed by laurel and hardy. Food poor and gave me dreadful stomach upset so I missed my first day holiday excursions.

"It has been four and a half months since Egyptair lost my suitcase. Since then, I have not received my suitcase or any compensation.

In my dealings with Egyptair, my communications have been ignored most of the time. The service I have received from Egyptair throughout my entire experience with them has been extremely poor and very disappointing. 

Egyptair eventually came back to me with an offer to pay only 68% of my missing suitcase claim. Except for the things that Egyptair can never pay me back for (the three days of holiday in Rome that we lost and will never get back, my wedding earrings that I took with me on holiday, the sentimental souvenirs of the places we visited), they are not even willing to pay me the full amount of the missing items in my suitcase.

"My recent (and first) experience with EGYPTAIR was nothing short of disastrous! I strongly advise you stay as far away as possible from this pathetic excuse for an airline, and here’s why:

I was traveling from Toronto to Lagos on 28th October with a 3.5 hour layover at Cairo. First they reschedule the flight from Toronto to 2 hours later, and then there’s another 45 minute delay for take off! I was terrified that I may miss my connecting flight but thankfully that didn’t happen as I literally ran to the boarding gate at Cairo airport. Unfortunately, my checked in bag didn’t make it. I landed in Lagos but my checked in bag was left behind in Cairo. When I approached the airport authorities at Lagos they took down my complaint and informed me that my bag would arrive the next day. So here I was without my bags, or any extra clothes or toiletries in Lagos for more than a day and as if that wasn’t enough when I finally got my bag the next day I find out that the LOCK WAS OPENED and much of my STUFF WAS GONE! I had been ROBBED!

Next, I did what I had to do and e-mailed EGYPT AIR regarding the stolen items from my checked in baggage on 31st October. They responded to me the same day asking for details of the missing items along with their prices and receipts. I obviously didn’t have the receipts handy but somehow managed to retrieve them and e-mailed them back with all the necessary info and documentation the very same day. It’s been more than a week now and I have not received any acknowledgment/update from them, even after multiple follow ups. I also tried contacting their FaceBook page but the only response I got was ‘please get in touch with the concerned department’. A locked checked in bag being opened in transit and stuff being stolen from it is in no way a small issue and the complete lack of apathy on part of EGYPT AIR towards its customers is absolutely appalling!

So in nutshell, STAY AWAY FROM EGYPT AIR! If you value your peace of mind (and belongings), please make sure you avoid EGYPT AIR at all costs!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639snehan,Sneha N wrote a review Nov 2019,Sneha N,"Leeds, United Kingdom",3 contributions,8 helpful votes,Toronto - Lagos,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r724987606-EGYPTAIR-World.html,WORST AIRLINE EXPERIENCE EVER!!,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very smooth and nice flight from Paris to Cairo. New plane with single seats next to the windows. Very caring and helpful staff. I had a low fat meal (new on Egyptair) nothing fancy but good. Choice of films is still a bit limited. A strange thing also is that the table is very high, especially when you work on your computer. However, there is a clear improvement of Egyptair which used to be far behind what you would expect from a Star Alliance airline. Just make sure to choose the right time.

"Let me start with the positives. Price was considerably lower than competitors, crew were excellent, flights were on time and food was plentiful. And the overnight kit was one of the better ones.

Now the downsides. Seats are rather tired (ashtrays), not very comfortable, but with incredible leg room on the leg from Geneva to Cairo and return. Food is below average. No alcohol is served. On the Cairo to Joburg and return the seats recline to a near flat bed. Food was better, but only marginally and still below average.

Lounges in Cairo serve no alcohol, the food while plentiful is not very good and hard to relax in the seating.

Not a bad experience at all and the price reflects the quality. They need to get better food.

The toilets are enough and neat.
The Airline also took us to Novotel Hotel in Cairo for a transit night but really wasted a lot of time. We arrived Cairo 9pm but were only taken to the Hotel at midnight. We didn't have enough time to sleep. Their on-board services are a lot better than the Airport services.

"This was really the worst flight experience I have ever had and I fly a Lot. We was supposed to depart from Sharm el Sheikh at 15:55, only 10 minutes before the flight we was shown on the board that the flight is delayed for an hour with no further explanation and nobody was there from the staff to ask for any information or help. Then the flight time changed 2 times again and we was delayed now till 17:55. When finally someone came there was no apologies, and on the question what will be with our conecting flights we was just told ""My college will bring you new boarding pass"". That was all they had to say. So since we missed the flight at 18:05 from Cairo to Hurghada, we was put on the next flight at 22:25 ( which was in the end also delayed). After spending 3 and half hours in Cairo airport it was time to board the flight to hurghada, in the control than they told us we have to throw our lighter away, after talking him that we was flying with the same lighter just 3 hours ago we got no reaction. And what made me more angry..... The Guy behind us was allowed to keep his lighter. Seriously that was my worst experience ever.

On the way home, we found a star alliance member flight, Egypt Air, which served a non-stop route from Cairo to JFK.  We thought this 12 hour flight would be ideal as we would likely be exhausted from all the sightseeing.  THIS WAS A MISTAKE.The captain smoked cigarettes throughout the whole flight.  The aircraft smelled of smoke and flight attendants acknowledged this, confirmed it was the captain smoking, and proceeded to spray a hideous perfume around the cabin to help mask the stench.  This made it worse!  The entire aircraft was coughing...ironically the no smoking sign stayed illuminated throughout the whole flight.I find it ironic that the entire airline is dry (no beer, wine or liquor), but the captain can fill the air with cigarette smoke for a long haul flight.  Google other reviews as this is not the first time.If you have any choice in airline...opt for a stop over and avoid this airline at all costs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelinggnilevart,Travelinggnilevart wrote a review Oct 2019,Travelinggnilevart,"Houston, Texas",2 contributions,,Cairo - New York City,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r717870277-EGYPTAIR-World.html,NEVER AGAIN.

"We flew with two kids to Cairo on EGYPTAIR and the airline had such poor service. They did not have infant safety belts on board and as such I just had to hold onto my 1 year old during take off and landing.

"Flying from Barcelona to Cairo and next to Luxor, the baggage was lost somewhere. During all days staying in Egypt we were repeatedly told the baggage was at Cairo but couldn't reach us, then when we were in Aswan they said it was in Luxor, then back to Cairo... In summary they were cheating us every day to avoid face the fact they lost the baggage. Back at home we tried to request the compensation but after more than one month Egypt Air failed to respond to any of the multiple requests via their advertised email addresses and phone numbers. I think is the worst experience I have ever had from a service provider. It's really difficult for me to understand how this terrible behavior and horrible customer care can be part of Star Alliance. Obviously I will try to avoid as much as possible flying again with Egypt Air based on the customer care sensitivity and I will recommend NOT to do to all my friends ...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaumec781,Jaume C wrote a review Oct 2019,Jaume C,,1 contribution,,Barcelona - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r716027384-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Beware!

"We were booked on Egyptair through a travel company. The Airbus was not very clean and for a 10 hr flight the seats were not comfortable at all. The entertainment screens were dirty. To top it off, the cabin where we were seated was uncomfortably hot for the entire trip. Could not find cabin crew to complain. They were there only for food service and no other time.

"So, i was ready for a s%$t show when I got to the desk in Toronto. A number of reviews I had read had contained horror stories about everything from attitude to cleanliness.

When I approached the check-in desk, after spending quiet time in the Air Canada Lounge which Business Class entitles you to, the lady behind the counter was very pleasant. she appeared to be seriously overworked, but smiled and made a bit of small talk. Definitely a good start.

So, back to the boarding. Apparently some of the passengers felt that they could crowd the entrance lines at will, without regard to their ticket group/number/class. I did have to politely inform one gentleman that there was a line for Business Class and that it required him to go to the end. He looked sheepish and tried to mime not speaking English, until another passenger seconded my request in his native tongue that he remove himself from the head of the line.

So that experience, while irksome after waiting half an hour in line, had nothing to do with Egyptair, and they worked diligently to make the boarding process smooth. The process went smoothly and once on board it was easy to find my seat.

So the seats are NOT ""dreamliner"" type seats with individual cocoons that isolate you from other passengers. However they do have privacy screens, and that kept me isolated enough. Service by the cabin crew was very good. I have been on some flights where they virtually anticipate your every whim, and this was not one of them. However, the attendants circulated regularly, and contrary to other reviews I have read, they do refill your non-alcoholic drinks, although on request.

The food was very good, and service was efficient. the blankets were fluffy and the seat recline suited me, although I have heard some say they are not lay flat, it seemed to let me lay flat and stretch out nicely.

Two interesting tidbits. They give you stickers to put on your seat showing if you want to be woken for meals, are interested in duty free, or want to be left alone. What a great idea for a business class experience where one might need to sleep and have no interest in duty free. I chose to wake up for meals since I was hungry and sure enough they got me up and served. The second tidbit is they have a ""star ceiling"". they project stars on the ceiling of the cabin to help you sleep I guess. Cool.

I watched a movie, and the inventory was good not great. Games worked well, and I used my own music, so that was not evaluated.

Overall I have to say that the reviews I had read had me ready for a grumpy, ill mannered crew, old outdated equipment, and terrible food. I found this flight to be anything but!

Kudos to the crew and staff for making a very long flight to Cairo very enjoyable.

The second leg was Cairo to Riyadh. this was more of a circus when trying to board, until the boss called for Business Class in a separate line. The gate in Cairo was a mess, and no one seemed to care.

The airframe was older, with seats I remember from 2001ish. However lots of room, and again good service. Again the crew and staff did their job and flight was very good.

I don't know what these other reviewers were on about. I hope that the dates of their reviews had something to do with the vitriol they heaped on Egyptair. I can only say, that as someone who flies regularly in the US, and frequently worldwide, this was NOT a negative experience. Given price and schedule considerations I would certainly fly Egyptair again in the future.

I will be updating this for my return trip in nine days so watch this space!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdwilliams44,Mark wrote a review Oct 2019,Mark,"Kingsport, Tennessee",82 contributions,44 helpful votes,Toronto - Riyadh,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r715016110-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good experience on Egyptair after hearing horror stories!,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"it was the first time and def. the last time flying with EGYPT Air.
I travelled from Madrid via Cairo to Muscat. The flight left with one hour delay in Madrid and therefor the transit was very short. Even so the plane left 30 minutes later in Cairo they were not able to load my baggage to the plane. I asked the ground handling staff at the airport in Cairo and they confirmed me all is loaded. Unfortunately while I arrived in Muscat nothing arrived. As per Egypt Air the suitcase has been loaded and they do not care about looking for it. So did the complain straight after i arrived and 24 H later still no answer at all from EGypt Air.
I called the Airport Station Manager he confirmed me to get back to me, same style after 12 hours no answer they really dont care about customers.

I did have one booked in the cabin but knew as soon as I saw the carrier he was in that it probably wouldn't be allowed in the cabin due to it being slightly too big. I was right so all 3 went in the hold. I was a little worried as the one cat was very frail but all 3 were absolutely fine the other end. The staff were fabulous. The seats very comfortable and the food fantastic. I was a bit miffed that there was an empty seat next to me so the frail cat could have travelled in with me but I get why he couldn't.

"I acutally flew Egypt AIr three times.
The first was Johannesburg, South Africa to Cairo.
The second, Cairo to Aswan.
The third, Hurghada to Cairo.

All were economy class flights. Except for the first flight, they were all short and not worth upgrading. They were all pretty basic. Some of the seats reclined better than others. A seat in front of me kept reclining whether or not the pax seated there wanted to lay back or not.

Cleanliness was OK. Restroom cleanliness was OK too.
I prefer window seats because I like the view. However on 2 planes, I saw more window scratches than anything else.
Also, there are still ashtrays in the armrests - at least they don't smell of cigarettes still - although one kind of did.

If I were back in Egypt, I would use them again though I would stick with my other preferred carriers for international travel heading in/out of Cairo when possible.

Airport check in:
In Johannesburg, there is no permanent EgyptAir desk. So you have to wait for those to open up. If you go too early you will wait for a while before you can check your bags. If you've got no bags to check, then you might be able to get through security to relax in a lounge.

in Cairo, relatively painless check in due to early morning flight.

Hurghada to Cairo - easy check in as we were early. But even though the concierge at the hotel said we wouldn't need that much time, earlier is better. Later, the line was really long and slow. Even though it's a small airport, it's just nicer not having to rush.

In general, service at check-in was very simple. Nothing too friendly, nothing too rude.
In flight service was more friendly but nothing extravagant.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/a0/65/fb/kumimonster.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kumimonster,Kumi M wrote a review Sep 2019,Kumi M,"Palo Alto, California",1465 contributions,205 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r713743826-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Egypt Air.

"Recently flew aboard an egypt air plane to Cairo from Johannesburg.

The plane was a fairly modern airbus A330. Each individual seat had an infotainment system with the latest movies and was equipped with a leg rest which is not normally found on planes these days.

The seats are a little cramped but not to the extent that it would make the flight unbearable.

The cabin crew are diligent however not the most friendly (a smile would do wonders)

The food was tasty and served within an hour of take off.

All passengers receive an amenity bag with a dental kit, socks, ear plugs and an eye mask.

Overall I would most certainly fly Egypt air again in the future",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914zubairp,Zubair P wrote a review Sep 2019,Zubair P,"Centurion, South Africa",112 contributions,47 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r712542042-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Pleasantly surprised ,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from a 3-star airline like Egyptair at first, but my flight from Bangkok to London with a stopover in Cairo was fantastic!

Firstly, the check-in counter of Egyptair at BKK is very organised, as a frequent BKK airport user I can tell you that this is one of the fastest check-ins I've ever had, only second to Thai Airways.

Security was of course, slow, but I guess you can't blame it on the airline.

Boarding was very professional, flight attendants came around to make sure that bags are stowed and passengers are seated, just like a regular full-service airline.

Upon arrival in CAI, there wasn't really anything special, the flight landed at 4am in the morning and passengers were escorted by bus to the terminal for arrivals/transfer.

However, upon my departure from Cairo, there was a crying baby onboard! Passengers sitting nearby had no choice but to move to the already-full rear section of the plane, the crew did absolutely nothing to help this situation, the baby stayed on the flight until landing. All passengers from rows 21-30 all had headaches throughout the flight! Not a pleasant one.

I also would like to bring up that my suitcase was RUINED (in every possible way - from the wheels to the deep scratches on the surface). I don't know if I can blame this on the airline because it's usually the airport's fault, but I've contacted Egyptair and no response was given one week after the incident. Not a very responsive cx service in my experience!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/0e/b7/6b/jason777200.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason777200,Jason wrote a review Sep 2019,Jason,"London, United Kingdom",11 contributions,15 helpful votes,Bangkok - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r711694128-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Much better than expected!,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Egypt Air lost my baggage when I was in transit from Casablanca to Cairo on the 16th of Sept on flight MS848, the ground staff in Casablanca assured me that someone would take care of my luggage but it never showed up.

For the last 5 days I have written to every customer service email, social media handle, called every hotline, local police, airport authorities and personnels to find out what's happened and where have they misplaced my bag. Til now NOONE, has responded to me, all replies I received were vague answers like 'we have contacted our team in Casablanca and asked them to look into it', 'we don't know where your luggage is there is no respond from Casablanca, maybe it has not arrived in Casablanca'. Are you kidding me?!

I am extremely devastated because everything in that luggage mean so much to me, they are my personal journal, notes, cards, gifts and jewelries that has been with all my travels in the last decade. I am extremely devastated because no one is speaking to me, I haven't got any written reply from Egypt Air, they are slacking and not handling their passengers' belongings with care, and my time is running out here in Cairo. What more do I need to do?

Please Egypt Air, you really screwed up here. And now you are ignoring your passenger, leaving me hanging without a single clue of what's going on. When I left the airport without my luggage you said I would need to wait 3 days for someone to respond to my emails, I have sent out all the info about the luggage and it's contents, and receive ZERO reply!!! C'mon!! I love Egypt so much I refuse to believe the people at Egypt Air is not doing anything about my luggage!! Please rectify your carelessness and your mistake and someone reply to my emails.

"The staff are incredibly unprofessional. They tried to trigger a family from Iraq by claiming that they needed extra security screening...this family was in the same line as me: an actual Canadian flying back to Canada. So, unless these low life employees were going to claim that I, too, required extra screening, they were just being scum harassing this family.

The flight went out over an hour late because the staff had to kiss all of their friends in the line up. I was about to contact security in Canada over these people since the 'friends' did not have to go through the same screening process as everyone else... definitely breeding grounds for terrorism and potential for something to 'slip through security'.

Then, some creep, who was friendly with a 'modest' (*insert sarcasm*) female employee, sat next to me despite it not being his seat. Another security and passenger safety issue. But, don't worry, the female employee got some kisses in from this creepy passenger.

If the passengers/employees on these airlines ever get flagged for thorough security checks, they're certainly not getting any sympathy from me.

"Recently took a flight from the US to the Middle east. The long haul flight was pleasant with business class seats resembling semi private pods. great service by the air hosts and hostesses and very service oriented. clean bathrooms during the flight was a relief. A bed service as is offered on other major airlines was not offered. Great food and snacks.

This great service was not however provided during transit in Cairo
After being herded towards the transit lounge we were informed the destination we were going to was from another terminal and we had to wait for the transport to take us there. Without being told when or how we would be going to this terminal we were made to wait for close to 20 mins without being informed on progress. Afte an 11 hour flight this was certainly not ideal. We were eventually transferred to another gate and had to wait for transport to take us to the other terminal. when we arrived at CV sias 'other terminal' we had to go through security into a large waiting haul...one had to use ones intuition to find someone to ask where the lounge was...only to find a lounge where we were informed that we were to be transported to yet another lounge and would have to wait for yet another form of transport to take us there. The lounge had wifi and a full buffet with very attentive staff. No showers and only one abultuon facility that was mostly occupied...again hardly ideal after a 11 hour flight.

The handling of passengers and informing them of the process especially after 11hours would be a first step instead of blindly informing passengers to wait. Also it would be prudent to have the staff go through security at the lounge instead of transporting them to two different buildings.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Intrepidtraveller232,Intrepid Traveller wrote a review Sep 2019,Intrepid Traveller,,20 contributions,13 helpful votes,Washington DC - Jeddah,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r709198547-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good flight but poor transit information,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had to change last minute from Emirates. Egypt air was available and £1000 cheaper.
The plane was old, the seats an old style and over spaced verses new airlines, this worked for me as I am 6'4'' and i could stretch out in the nearly flat seats, so big tick for sleeping. The entertainment kit is old, so the remotes intermittently work and the screens are a little low in resolution but ok.

The food is really poor, as an example cheese would be cheddar that has been in the open air and dried out and say brie similarly dry. Breakfast a plain tasteless omelet, coffee warm not hot, no alcohol, but the fruit juices are the cheapest boxed type.

"There is a lot to say. In summary for those not wanting to read too much, the staff members are incredibly rude and refuse to communicate during and after a delayed flight. I was delayed both ways and therefore it is obvious that they are not reliable. The food is pretty terrible, the drinks were unavailable and the entertainment is shockingly boring.

I definitely understand flight delays. I am sympathetic towards Airlines that have to delay their flights. However, I can't stress enough how important communication is in these situations! My flight was delayed by 21 hours. I am a female travelling alone and therefore made sure that my stop overs would be maximum 4 hours. When my flight was delayed I was not told what was going on, only that 'I must go home and come back tomorrow morning'. What time? No one could give an answer. So I went home. and arrived at 7am the next morning. I then got informed that EgyptAir offices will only open at 10:30am. So I waited.
When I eventually got in contact with an EgyptAir employee, I was rudely told that I will board the next flight that leaves at 2:30pm. I asked about the rest of my flight, when will I leave Cairo to get to Paris? Turns out they wanted me to have a 12 hour delay in Cairo! I specifically booked a flight with a 3 hour stop over, I am not willing to wait in an airport for 12 hours alone. As a matter of fact I paid more for my flight ticket just for the short layover.
After a lot of begging and a massive delay, they ended up putting me on a direct flight at 7pm.
Because of this delay, I missed accommodation and transport that had been paid for. I also had to catch up with my tour which was a massive expense particularly with the exchange rate. I was promised compensation for all of that. It is two and a half months after my delay, I have emailed every single day almost like it became a religion. The result?
You may have guessed - I have been ignored blatantly for these past two and a half months. Until now.
Today they finally responded, they would like to offer 20% discount on my next flight. First off, that's nowhere near the amount of money I lost. Secondly, did they really think I'd ever fly with them again? And third, a discount results in me spending more money not gaining the money that I lost. Common sense.

It has taken me a long time to write this review only because I wanted to give EgyptAir the benefit of the doubt. But they have showed me over and over again that they do NOT value their customers. I'm disgusted and plain shocked at how people are not willing to do their one job. They get paid to ignore the people paying them, great EgyptAir.

Additionally, their flights are way over-priced for what you get. Much prefer to pay R2000 more and get a proper non-delayed flight with great entertainment and good enough food through Emirates.

Enough said, I hope.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip711136,Trip711136 wrote a review Sep 2019,Trip711136,,2 contributions,,Johannesburg - Paris,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r706841020-EGYPTAIR-World.html,SHOULDN'T CUSTOMER SUPPORT BE A PRIORITY?,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Short story: I will NEVER fly EgyptAir ever again. I would not recommend anyone to fly with or waste their money on this airline.

Long story: I flew with this airline twice in a 2 month span. Once at the end of June 2018 and again in early August 2018. Both flights were roundtrip JFK-CAI.

The first flight at the end of June was my first experience with the airline. First my husband and I were not seated together for an almost 12 hour flight. We tried to ask for this to be corrected prior to the flight via phone, via the check in desk and they all said there was nothing they could do.

Once on the flight we managed to sit beside each other near the window. Which brings me to my second point, DO NOT SIT near the window. Worse decision ever. The plane is very old and doesn't have individual air vents. The way it's set up, it doesn't blow towards the passengers seated near the windows. So as you can imagine, it gets outrageously hot.

On that same flight, we noticed the flight attendants fighting with one another and one of them actually walked passed us crying!

Also, the tv for my seat was not working for the entire duration of the flight. I asked multiple times for it to be fixed and different attendants would say they would restart it to no avail. On request number 4 and 5 I was told they would do something extra to make it work which obviously did absolutely nothing. That is they did anything at all. Not to mention the heat the tv screens emitted only exacerbated the hot and poor air circulation situation.

In early July, on the flight back from CAI to JFK we again were sitting near the window which meant we were sitting in a sauna. I'm pretty sure the temperature was cooler in Egypt than on the plane. It was awful.

When they brought my food out an ant was walking across my tray. That aside from the fact that the food is subpar made me lose my appetite.

Also on this same flight a passenger a few seats ahead of us started yelling at the attendants because she had asked for water multiple times and no one had provided any to her. She also complained of the heat that we were all experiencing. It should not be normal for passengers to be sweating on a 12 hour flight in such conditions.

I even personally asked one of the attendants to turn on the a.c. which she said she would do. Instead, they went down all the rows and asked all the passengers to close their windows. What year are we in?? Why did I pay a ridiculous amount of money for makeshift solutions??

In early August we unfortunately had to take the same JFK - CAI again. We had booked all our flights at the same time otherwise I definitely would not have taken the same airline.

This time we had my father in law with us who needs additional assistance on and off the airplane. We were assigned the middle row this time (not near the windows) and I must say, now I know where all the cold air was going! While I was very cold the people near the window were still complaining about how hot the plane was.

Unfortunately for me, my pillow was already dirty and my blanket had a dead bug in the plastic wrapping with it. I showed them both to the attendant and asked for them to be replaced she said okay and took them away. No one returned with a replacement so I followed up and they said they didn't have any more. So, ironically enough I was now cold without a blanket.

On the returning flight the 3 of us were seated apart even though we requested to be seated together. Additionally, I was very nauseous at some point and urgently requested some water from an attendant multiple times and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes! This same attendant was also the same one who was giving my father in law, an older man, a hard time for asking for anything.

In summary, the few hundred saved is not worth the treatment or conditions on these flights. If you need to travel pick another airline. Dont waste your time or money on this disaster show. For me to complete this review a year later is a testament to how bad it was.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/52/de/8d/ryann-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229ryannm,Ryann wrote a review Sep 2019,Ryann,,2 contributions,2 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r706463952-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Don't fly with them.,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Egypt Air airplanes between Lagos and Cairo must be the shabbiest and dirtiest in their fleet.  Not only do the seats look so terribly worn out but the two main levers to adjust them - foot rest and incline simply do not work.  In addition to the dodgy airplane seats, flight MS 876 of 22 August that departed at 14h20 had horrible service.  Business class passengers in particular (I was in business class) were served their whole meal on single blue plastic disposable meal trays and thin  disposable plastic cups for drinking. For cutlery, we were given white disposable plastic spoon and plastic fork (no knife - plastic or otherwise). We were served with a choice between fish, chicken and beef.  I chose beef.   The beef was a single roundish lump of meat sitting in some indistinguishable and unnamed liquid. When I asked for a knife, the flight attendant said she had none and suggested I change my choice of food - which I did.  The one harried attendant who served the business class passengers during the 6-hour flight seemed to have little or no experience in serving on a plane.  Even on a scale of one to one hundred, I would still hesitate to give the business class of Egypt Air flight MS 876 of 22 August 2019 that departed at 14h20 from Lagos murtala muhammed international airport a one!  I certainly will never fly Egypt Air business class again and advise whoever cares to read this review not to either.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MomoTMO,TMO wrote a review Aug 2019,TMO,,5 contributions,4 helpful votes,Lagos - Cairo,North Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r704374006-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Horrible, cringe-worthy Egypt Air Lagos/Cairo flight MS 876 of 22 August 2019",Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had to stop over at Cairo airport since the layover is over 11 hours but we check with our handler and also with Egpyt air if we can stay at Meridien Hotel right off the terminal 3 without a Visa. The answer is ""yes"" no problem. We book the hotel for an overnight stay when we got to Cairo airport, the Egpyt air said we need a Visa since they have another plane arriving at Cairo in 4 hours and they can not arrange a hotel stay or a Visa for us. We said we provide our own hotel at the Meridien and we pay for our own hotel but you guys said in Queen Alia International Airport that we don't need a Visa and now we have to get one to leave the airport to get into the Meridien Hotel at Terminal 3. My final conclusion to this issue is bad communication and no one can give a correct answer before we book our hotel. My other note to Egpyt air is that the stewardesses on the plane don't pick up any papers on the aisles and half the restrooms were stuck with paper towels in the toilets which cause the restrooms unusable thru our 11 hours of flight time. When we landed at JFK the stewardesses did not give direction on not to get up until we fully stop at the gate. A lot of passengers started to get up and get their pieces of luggage from the overhead.

"I’ve recently used Egyptair to fly to Kenya
I don’t usually write any reviews but I wouldn’t want anyone to suffer too
The flight is the same as Ryan air all cramped and the connecting flight I wouldn’t even try to rate as it’s terrible
The connecting flight we are rushed so that it leaves on time
But our baggage handlers are relaxed and didn’t bother to load onto the connecting flight.
2 days no luggage and the worst flight experience ever
Then to top it off at London Heathrow we got all our seats confirmed with our meal plans only to find out that there were no vegetarian meals on flight
To try and accommodate we would have been happy with fruit
But again nothing onboard

On our return journeyed tried to confirm our meal plan and seats which egyptair sorted for us in Heathrow
Again they could not accommodate us
And the manager blamed it on the British government which is ridiculous

To top it off our luggage was delayed again on the way back to London
It seems like the staff were all sleeping
As we found a few staff sleeping behind our seats in departures,
And immigration staff had to wake up other staff sleeping to let us through
No finger prints, no photo just a quick stamp and off he went back to sleep

I wouldn’t fly with Egyptair even if they offered me a free flight as the quality of everything is very low,service is slow and I don’t want to get frustrated so the best thing is not to think of Egyptair at all

"I highly recommend you don't fly Egypt Air. We did a short flight with them and in the 1.5hr trip they broken 2 brand new bags.

We then in person filled out the forms as they directed. By staff in person at Cairo airport immediately after flight.

Only to find when landing in Australia they will only pay for 1 bag as we fill in 1 form as asked by staff.

2 passengers, 1 bag allowance per ticket and yet they won't help.

That's not the issue for over a year now we get NO HELP, NO CARE. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with.

It's so simple yet no one replies and no one can just make the decision.

Their form says 21days, we have 400days and counting.

"I tried to book a flight with Egyptair from JFK to CAI with Egyptair website but the payment got denied so I called my bank in the US to check what the problem is and they confirmed to me that my credit card is in a good shape and Egyptair didn't request the payment so I saved the reservation pending to the payment and called the Egyptair in NY +1 2125815600
A lady answered and said ""yes"" ,didn't even introduce herself ,so I provided her with the pending reservation number
she was very aggressive with me and didn't even give me the chance to talk and explain my booking situation .
She asked for my address ,so I gave her my street name and number and zip code connected to my credit card ,but she aggressively said ""just answer what you been asked for ! "" when I offered to provide the City and the state ! then I gave all the info she asked but she came back to tell me that the purchase has been denied
I did my best to go to the next level of support and she keep raising her tone for no reason and keep telling me ""that is it""
I asked to transfer me to another department like billing department ,but she were very rude
She don't know how to handle or troubleshoot a booking issue
That's when I told her I need to talk to your supervisor when she said "" You are talking to one right now !!""
I asked her for her name ,I got no clue .
I asked again ""may I speak to your supervisor please ?"" She started insulating me and then forced me to be on hold with without even asking ! Then she ended the call with no notice
Got a call later from someone called himself Charles he refused to help after I kept asking who overview this office and refused to provide me with any answer and not even an apology furthermore he said he tried to use my card for the booking after the lady employee hang on me at the time I wasn't even on the call with them without my consent ""That's called in The US ""identity theft ""and told me he will put me in hold to talk to someone who didn't even identify his name or position even after I kept asking ""as he said because he is going to be nervous on me !!""
After couple of minutes somebody said his name is Ayman the supervisor of the reservation which add nothing new except the lady name which he claimed to be ""Radia""
After this customer services I received I don't even believe all those names to be real names !!
It is a shame the ancient Egyptair which is one of the oldest Airlines in the world to let unprofessional group of employee to treat their customer that way not only in a rude and unprofessional way ,but also by getting involved in identity theft activities.

"I bought a couple of souvenirs at the airport in the Egyptair shop. They had to cost 6 euros but the cashier (a man) tells us 7 euros. I pointed out that the price had to be 6 euros but he repeated 7 euros. He makes us pay and tells us that we have to wait a few seconds for the receipt. After giving us the receipt we immediately run to the gate because the plane was about to leave. Only later did I see that the receipt had been made of 6 euros and not 7. In practice the cashier pocketed 1 euro. Surely it is a scam repeated very often during the day. In my opinion the cops are also involved in the scam, since there was one to hear them.

Among other things, the scam is compounded by the fact that it is an important egyptair store! Don't buy or at the end report!

I needed a pharmacy and was not allowed access as it was outside of the international departures. tis was an 8 hour stop-over.  I was told by the 'PR"" DESK THAT MY OPTIONS WERE~ BRIBE ONE OF THE TOILET CLEANERS TO GO AND BUY THE LADY PRODUCTS or option two : Cancel my ongoing flight so I could exit the transit area!!!Well you can imagine!

"I have traveled domestically with Egypt Air and the first experience was good. The second was horrible - the AC wasn’t working from Luxor to Cairo and it was 45C outside - it was so hot and stuffy - babies were screaming, it was a nightmare.

From that flight, I had to connect to Egypt Air onto Toronto. We were supposed to board at 12:35, they didn’t open the boarding security until 12:45 and it was the most insufficient, unorganized process I’ve ever seen.

Three desk agents hanging around talking while three others are all on one side herding people through. They need to make two lines - one for Canadian passport holders and one for everyone else. Having to check visa and residency info takes forever and congests the process.

Finally, we went through our THIRD security point and were told we couldn’t bring our water that was purchased passed security, passed customs, IN the terminal! No amenities were past their final check - not even bathrooms. I was incredibly angry with this and so were parents of small children forced to throw out their just purchased drinks for the flight.

One agent tried saying it was Egypt law but that’s a load of crap since we came through 2 other checkpoints with water AND in Luxor they jet us go through with huge, sealed bottles. Major inconvenience to fliers - wouldn’t recommend for long haul flights.

Lastly, on the plane, we were filling out customs forms and the flight attendant came by telling us we absolutely had to put our tray tables up because we were landing ..... in 45 minutes.

"I traveled through to Egypt Air airlines . 1. MS 652 (RUH - CAI) 2. MS 647 (CAI - RUH) ......Both Flights were on time
MS 652( RUH - CAI ) :
Check in and boarding was very easy from Riyadh.Customer service was helpful. The food and beverages were great. The seats were comfortable.There was LCD on every seat for entertainment.Headphones were given by airline.From RUH - CAI the journey was excellent .
MS 647 ( CAI - RUH ) :
We went through terminal 1 which was only for Egypt Air flights. Check in was hard. There was no luggage booking counter for flights to Riyadh . We booked are luggage through counters for London. The waiting lounge was small. An hour before time of boarding they sent us to another lounge which was just after the previous one.That lounge was closed at start.

On board :
Unlike MS 652. In the aircraft the entire section shared only one LCD located on the ceiling Which gave only Routing,distance left to destination and other flight info . So their was no entertainment system.
The positive point is that The food and beverages were excellent..
I travelled through 2 Flights one was excellent while other's rating on airport is average while on board is good .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/c7/d4/f0/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuhammadZamir,Muhammad Zamir wrote a review Jul 2019,Muhammad Zamir,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",26 contributions,35 helpful votes,Riyadh - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r690867613-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Excellent Cleanliness,Food and Beverages but Lack of Entertainment",Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The agent who had booked us in Istanbul on EgyptAir expressed more confidence than we felt in the airline choice. My first thought was that the confusion thereafter must be IST airport’s issue, until I met other passengers who had flown on EgyptAir. Our experience was confusing from the outset. Gates and ticket counters should be listed on screens, once inside the terminal. No signs of EgyptAir were present or displayed, until very late. Checkin was delayed, as was the flight. The passengers we met who were returning or connecting through Cairo said their checked luggage had been lost for a week, so we did not check in any of our baggage before flying EgyptAir. Once at the gate, there were no signs or agents. The last-minute gate change was not announced or shown, so I nearly missed the flight. (My husband had called the lacking level of Egyptian security “frightening.”) Once on board, the flight attendants were fine with a knowledge of English and mostly fluent in Arabic. Mushy Halal food and beverages were served quickly, which was the best aspect of our flight experience. The odd thing was that passengers could not choose their inflight entertainment; entire sections shared one ceiling screen that played a children’s movie. Our landing was bumpy, but we were just glad that we had arrived safely in Cairo. Our return flight would be booked and arranged on our own, via other airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnLily,AnLil wrote a review Jul 2019,AnLil,,862 contributions,484 helpful votes,Istanbul - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r690373678-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Rocky ride,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me first explain my reasons why I may choose not to travel by Egypt Air ever again. On the London-Cairo leg, the cabin crew were supercilious and uncaring. Ridiculous, right, for hospitality staff to consider themselves superior to dark-skinned passengers? At least that’s what I thought. Then, on the flight to Mumbai, the passengers were uncouth. The loos were filthy. The guy before me left shoe marks on the seat so the awfully long time he took was not just to relieve himself but maybe also to do some kind of dance inside. Both aircrafts were ancient, cramped, and lacking inflight entertainment. At the same time it must also be said with respect that on the second flight, after serving dinner, the cabin crew walked up and down the aisles calling out ‘chai’ and ‘coffee’ and serving these beverages for quite a long time, so with that and the crappy toilets, it was a bit like travelling by train in India in the old days.
And now for my reason why I would *always* look for a good price for London-Mumbai on Egypt Air! We had booked the cheapest flight we could find that suited our timings, and realised too late, only as the return journey approached, that Egypt offered no facility for visa on arrival or e-visa for Indians. It seemed like we would have no choice but to spend our 12-hour daytime transit in Cairo’s very uncomfortable airport. However, to our surprise and delight, Egypt Air provided us accommodation at the lovely Le Meridien Hotel inside the airport.

"Had one of my worst flying experience.
We were group of 16 (4 families 2 adults and 2 kids each)
When we tried web check in there was no option to select seats.. seats were preassigned and scattered all around the plane so we chose not to web check in.
When we reached the airport on check in counters we were again given seats scattered all arpund the plane. 2 2 seats in 8 different rows.
When we protested on counter the staff was downright rude and racist (seeing we were indians they were extra rude and pretty much accommodating to others).
Others in my group after a bit of protest gave in as they had 2 2 seats in different rows, so one child can sit with one adult. But my family had 4 seats in 4 different rows. When i kept on protesting the guy on counter was downright rude and almost started shouting.
We decided to proceed towards boarding gates. At boarding gates i told ground staff that how u expect me to seat my children( aged 5 years and 9 years) all alone in the flight. I told ground staff (and my wife recorded a video) that if anything happens inside the flight airline staff is solely responsible. Finally one guy budged and took my boarding passes. He requested some other passengers and finally arranged 2 seats + 2 seats in 2 different rows so atleast one adult can sit with one child.
What could have been easily done at check in counters was done at boarding gates after a lot of ruckus
Fianlly we boarded the plane mentally exhausted.
It has been the worst experience in my life.
The flight was good. Food was nice.
Entertainment available on board was good.
Over all it could have been a good experience if not for horrible check in experience.
Must look into this matter.

"The aircraft was a new Boeing 787, reasonably comfortable and very clean. The flight attendants seemed to struggle to smile but they were smart and very professional. The food looked ok and fellow passengers seemed to be tucking in quite happily. I don't eat airline food so cannot comment personally. The do not serve alcohol but lots of soft drinks, juices etc. I flew out with Lufthansa and would say that flight was no better than Egyptair.
The biggest downer was the check-in experience, but i am not sure that was the airlines fault.
Arrived at T3 and was told departure had changed to T2.
Went to T2, my flight was showing on the screens.
Tried to go through through security was told to go to T3.
Asked 'official' he said there was problem with 'the system' and wait 15 minutes.
After 5 minutes he said all was sorted and OK to go through security.
Tried again and again security said no, go to T3.
Went to T3 and check-in desks now open but not for my flight.
Used self check-in but no bag drop desks open. Eventually one opened and dropped my case off.
Went through passport control and more security and followed the signs to my gate BACK to T2!
More security.
Went to gate when plane was ready for boarding.
Let two passengers through then stopped for 15 minutes.

"I flew from Cairo to Dubai round trip with EgyptAir.

The outbound was in May and the return was in June. Both trips were almost perfect.

My first flight online check in they gave me a middle seat on the last row which I was able to change it later on (online) and on my return I was able to choose my seat during the check in (online).Both seats were free.

Punctuality was perfect on the return flight and about 1/2 hour delay on the outbound.

Airport check in with smooth except that they took my cigarette lighter 😥for security reasons on cairo airport but not on Dubai airport😂.

Blankets and pillows were provided during the flight. Good entertainment on flight.
First time to see the electronically dimmable windows on both flights.

Food was good, staff were a little bit old but they were friendly anyway.

2)Flight from Beirut delayed at least two hours as well.
3)International airway left passenger waiting more than 10-11 hours with no access to business lounge,airport hotel in Egypt,or even provision of free water unacceptable to say the least.
4)Old airport,un equippped with least requirements:internet even for a price:The man who sells internet is simply and always either is not there,probably on purpose to push passengers to use business lounge that again below average to say the least.

"The flight going from Toronto to Cairo was very good.

The attendants were also very attentive even in economy class.
However, all this was very different on the flight from Cairo back to Toronto. The essentials were not given, we had to ask for them. The flight attendants were least interested. The ""Hindu"" meals were just dry baked and tasteless chicken served with some salads. The only comfort was, we did not have anyone between me and my wife, so we could sleep on the 3 seats we got for ourselves.
The check-in procedure was good both ways.

Did anyone from Egypt Air bother to apologize or offer an compensation?
Not at all.

"Appalled by Egypt airways.

Without any notification they allowed passengers to arrive at OR Tambo for check in before informing us as baggage drop that our flight was cancelled. At this point we were given the option of returning home or getting a hotel, I had to specially request assistance to get a new flight. At this point I was directed up to the Egypt airways office, on the first floor with no elevator access. Lugging a 23kg bag up the stairs.

I then stood in a disorderly queue in an office with 5+ members of staff and only 2 assisting. I add, one member of staff sat on his phone playing videos at full volume. Service was slow and disorganized as they tried to assist 10 or so fellow passengers to get redirected flights. A couple in front of me we're told they could only get them to turkey on Thursday and that they would not reimburse them for their additional internal flights they'd miss or for 3 days of accommodation and tours they'd be losing. Another girl burst into tears as they told her that despite the fact that they were meant to have her in Rome yesterday, they'd now only have her there on Wednesday and she'd miss the start of her tour and some how have to rejoin her contiki group in a foreign country, without assistance.

I had little hope that assistance would be in my favor having witnessed the tears and frustrations of those passengers before me. The truth of the matter is, they took so long to assist me, that by the time I was seen to - every alternate flight for the evening had closed it's gate due to take off. There was one KLM flight remaining at 11.15pm. but as only business class seats remained, Egypt air refused to put me on it. This left me in JHB for another night, flying this evening with a different airline.

The most helpful member of staff was infact NOT an Egypt air staff member and infact a contractor.

I would not recommend Egypt air - for flight security and coverage by the EU aviation laws, pay more and fly a reputable airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerH5,Leanne B wrote a review Jun 2019,Leanne B,"London, United Kingdom",10 contributions,10 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r682329607-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Cancelled flight without notification.

"Egypt Air was the worse flying experience we have even had. They are equivalent to Spirit airlines in the US. Every flight in the terminal for them was delayed or cancelled. Our flight was delayed by more than 11 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight. When rebooking our connection the Egypt Air manager ensured us that our flight would be at 10pm and we paid our rebook fee of $250 per person (different airline). Long and behold, the 10pm flight did not depart until 12:45am causing us to miss our connection. The response we received from Egypt Air was that it is not their responsibility for another airline. We ended up losing 2 days of our next leg of travel and costing us over $1500.

For a place that constantly reminds tourists that a man is only as good as his word, the irony disgusts me. We were treated so poorly, airline personnel gave us attitudes, and as the only Americans in the airport, we were also the only passengers they did a thorough security check on.

Save yourself the headache and DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE.

"We traveled 4 sectors in May 2019 - Mumbai Cairo, Cairo Athens and then reverse. We have mixed feelings about the airline. Initially we went in with very little expectations as we had heard a lot of negative comments of the airlines.

However we were pleasantly surprised to see that the planes were reasonably neat and clean, the entertainment system and the movies and other entertainment on offer was quite new and the flights was on time on the Mumbai Cairo sector.

Since we had taken the emergency row seats so the space was also very good. However on this sector the staff was extremely RUDE - the service was very poor as they did not pick up the dishes after the service and left them lying on the trays, any request for water was met with a rude reply and in fact in the night flight one of the pursuers almost had a argument with my friend who was traveling with us. My friend folded the tray and kept the food tray under neath the seat in front of him as he wanted to sleep and the staff had not taken the tray for almost 2 hours and this staff member came and had a mild argument for the same.

Thankfully the other 3 sectors had better quality staff ad were more friendly. However the other negatives of the airline are as follows :

1. The food is not so great

2. The bathrooms are MINATURES - you cant even stand in them easily and the sink is just a small tray where the hands dont even fit

Overall I would not fly egypt air if I have a better choice for the same price -",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinaykumar2016,Vinay Kumar wrote a review Jun 2019,Vinay Kumar,"Mumbai, India",36 contributions,32 helpful votes,Mumbai - Athens,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r680708044-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Difficult to Grade This Airline - Inconsistent Services,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I took five flights with Egyptair in a one week vacation to Egypt.

First, we flew to Cairo from JFK. The plane was an older, well used, 777. There was nothing bad about it, but you can tell the aircraft is getting old. In the near future they are switching to new 787s and that should improve the situation. Crew were fine, did the basics, but nothing extra. The return from Cairo was similar, older 777 and mildly interested crew. If I had more time I probably would have flown another airline to Europe and then connected to Cairo, but needed the direct option to make the most of our week long vacation. Inside Egypt we flew with them down to Luxor, and then roundtrip to Sharm El Sheik. These domestic flights were fine, no issues.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/9d/d6/58/dougd72.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougD72,DougD72 wrote a review Jun 2019,DougD72,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",89 contributions,63 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r680434508-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Five Flights in One Week on Egyptair,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"EGYPTAIR from/to Cairo flies via Bangkok so the wonderful city of Cairo is now a direct flight away from Hong Kong. However, beware of EGYPTAIR’s cleanliness and service! The business class seats are really dirty, blankets and pillows have not been washed after use from the incoming flight. The cabin is absolutely filthy. The toilets are disgustingly dirty. The crew does nothing to keep the bathrooms clean and do as little as possible to serve the passengers. The food is so bad it’s inedible.
And a word of warning about Cairo. It has not recovered from the revolutions of 2009 and 2011. A week after our stay in Feb 2019 there was another bombing of Khan el-Khalili market. Security is extremely tight. Many International Hotels have closed up leaving the buildings derelict. Cairo remains a wonderful destination with wonderful people but sadly still has problems.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saltysauce,saltysauce wrote a review May 2019,saltysauce,"London, United Kingdom",57 contributions,127 helpful votes,Hong Kong - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r675570486-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Uncomfortable, dirty, poor service and hygiene standards!",Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Service is non-existant. The worst experience I ever had with an airline. Our first leg was delayed and an Egyptair employee met us at the gate to rush us to the next leg of the flight. He told us to buy a visa for 25usd, and were then told by immigration that we didn’t need it. His reaction was to shrug his shoulders, without any offer to give us our money back. Then as our luggage missed the connection, we had to return the next day to the airport to pick up our luggage ourselves and were given total 200 EGP (around 10USD) compensation even though the taxi ride return to the airport was more than that.

"Well, having just had an incredible experience flying business class on Turkish Air, Egyptian Air just did not come close at all. We booked four business class flights domestically around Egypt and we were actually in business class on the first two flights. On the third flight we were several rows back and the plane had a moveable curtain to separate business class from economy. The seats and food service were all the same throughout the plane so I’m not sure why they even sold business class flights on this type of plane. The flight attendant pulled the curtain closed and we were not on the business class side of it but in the first row of economy. We didn’t say anything because it seemed sort of silly to complain and make the flight attendant pull the curtain back one more row when we were all treated exactly the same otherwise. On our fourth flight, we were in the back of the plane and very definitely not in business class nor were we seated together. We are still waiting for a refund of the fee we paid for business class. In addition, the business class lounge for Egypt Air at Cairo’s Airport was a tiny room with only a few seats available and a tiny snack bar. It was crammed with people sitting on the floor and eating soggy pastries with coffee from a vending machine. I would not recommend flying business class on Egypt Air. It isn’t worth the uncharge at all. Oh - and to top it off, we had booked four domestic flights in Egypt but when I checked in for the first flight, I noticed we now had only three flights on our itinerary. There was no return flight to get us back from Aswan to Cairo. Unbelievable! So, we called our travel agent who worked miracles and got us on a flight hours later but at least we made it back to Cairo so we could get on our return flight to Istanbul. Awful experience. No way are we ever flying on EgyptAir again. Even if we hadn’t recently had a phenomenal experience on Turkish Air, this review would still be exactly the same. I fly internationally multiple time per year and domestically in many foreign countries for work and often into the heart of Africa and every other airline has been much better than Egyptian Air.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/3a/84/8f/jewelsworld.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jewelsworld,Jewelsworld wrote a review May 2019,Jewelsworld,"Chicago, Illinois",1521 contributions,437 helpful votes,Istanbul - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r673839882-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Flight missing from itinerary was the worst of many mistakes.,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In my round trip from Kennedy airport in New York to Cairo airport which takes more than 22 hours. There was nothing memorable during all these times. I think the time has come for these airlines to look around and get some idea from other airline who are doing much better just to make this hour you spent once or twice in your life memorable.
First thing I would like to see the staff more upbeat and motivated, running around with other services (even only water) not only to see them during the meal. I understand the security which is very important for me personally but let us make sure we deal with human who travel before they arrived to the airport to fly another almost 11 or 12 hours.

They then provided us with a super meal,with tea or coffee.....these services are all complimentary!  Before the flight was over they came round with drinks again.

I was hugely and pleasantly surprised to find it a very comfortable experience. The staff were totally professional and attentive, the flights were both on time, there was plenty of leg-room, the food was good and nicely presented (better than Qantas short haul).

"I am trying to compare like with like. In December, I flew from Larnaca to Bangkok via Amman. A newish Embraer on the first leg with a decent club class, followed by an excellent club class service on a long haul Boeing to Bangkok. In March I flew Egyptair from Larnaca to Johannesburg, again an Embraer on the short leg, but a much older plane, at least 40 years old, with no club class at all and very narrow seats. The longer leg was in a much older Boeing, with a considerably lower level of club class service.

That is not the only comparison however. The only competitors to Egyptair on the identical Larnaca to Johannesburg route are Emirates and Qatar. Both take 5 hours longer or more, allowing for stopovers, and are the best part of double the price in club class.
Comparing time and price on one side against quality of service on the other, I think Egyptair just shaves it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bifrons,bifrons wrote a review May 2019,bifrons,"Paphos, Cyprus",277 contributions,165 helpful votes,Larnaca - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r671687692-EGYPTAIR-World.html,THOROUGHLY AVERAGE,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew Egyptair from JFK to Cairo in early April for a Gate1Travel tour of Egypt, then flew quite a few domestic flights with Egyptair within Egypt, and finally back from Cairo to JFK with them. We were totally pleased with all flights. I'd read some bad reviews about them, but they were really great. On the short, domestic flights, we were sometimes on an Embraer 170, sometimes on a larger 737(?) and the legroom was fine, even for my 6'4"" husband. We were greeted with a smile and an offered juice box for the very short flights from Aswan to Abu Simbel and back, or from Luxor to Cairo, and we were well fed and taken care of on the longer international flights...….the food on the international legs was surprisingly good, the legroom in Economy was better than we expected (3-3-3 configuration), and the flight attendants were great. The bathrooms were kept up better than we've seen on many other flights. We experienced very little turbulance. The entertainment systems had plenty of movies and shows to keep us occupied, and the little ammenity pack given out (even in Economy!) was unexpected and very nice (toothbrush and toothpaste, ear plugs, mask, ear buds and slipper-socks). We would very happily fly with Egyptair again!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/3e/c7/b4/mgm530.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgm530,mgm530 wrote a review Apr 2019,mgm530,,530 contributions,156 helpful votes,Cairo - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r670459683-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Transatlantic flights AND domestic flights on Egyptair,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked two domestic tickets with EgyptAir: Cairo to Luxor in business class and Aswan to Cairo in economy. The short flights were perfectly ok. However, I have had much better short flights with airlines such as Garuda Indonesia. The flights were on time. Simple food with some drinks was provided. The domestic lounge at Cairo airport was very basic. The food selection was just sad.

"This is the 2nd time I fly with Egypt Air on a long haul flight. Luckily this time the airplane is Boeing 777 while the previous time it was 767. As this plane has individual entertainment screens and a newer plane, this trip was much better than the previous one. The direct flight from Toronto to Cairo is long (approx. 10.5 hours) but it is worth it as I avoided the burden of stopping in an airport in Europe. Instead of having to stop for 8 hours in Paris with Air France, I stopped for only 2.5 hours in Cairo. The service was average, 3 full meals provided for the Toronto-Cairo flight and 1 full meal for the Cairo-Amman flight (even though it was a 1.25 hours flight. No delay for both flights and the return flights. I know that they will start using Boeing 787 for the Toronto-Cairo flight this summer.

"After reading a mix of reviews about Egyptair, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. For my flight to Egypt, I flew direct from JFK in New York to Cairo. There was no wait in the business class line when I arrived to check in. Going through the business class security line was also very smooth. From there I went to the Swiss Lounge which was pretty quiet at about 3:30pm on a Saturday. While the food offerings were not expansive, they had a decent healthful spread. I enjoyed the fruit salad, olives, cheese and Chex mix. I even splurged and had a couple of mini brownies. The restrooms were comprised of small water closets rather than the typical large restrooms. The seating was pretty comfortable with sufficient charging outlets located throughout the lounge. Since I arrived early for my flight, this was a nice place the spend 1 1/2 hours before boarding.

The boarding process went pretty smoothly. Passengers line up per the designation on the boarding pass. Business Class passengers are in the Gold Track line and are the first to board after pre boarding. I was cheerfully greeted by the crew and escorted to my seat. Before takeoff, I was able to enjoy a delicious glass of guava juice. Shortly thereafter, the menu was handed out which provided dinner and breakfast selections. The starters came out first and were wrapped in plastic. I particularly enjoyed the fruit and slices of blue cheese and cheddar cheese. Part of the dessert was quite nice—fresh fruit served from a cart.

The Business Class cabin is not very large when compared to other business class cabins I have flown in. However, the seat was comfortable and was an “angle flat” seat. I found the seat area lacked storage for devices, though the overhead bins were quite spacious. The cabin was very clean and comfortable, including the restroom.

During my journey in Egypt, I also flew in the economy cabin from Cairo to Aswan and from Luxor to Cairo. I was again impressed with the comfort and quality of these flying experiences. There was more than adequate overhead bin space and the economy seats were reasonably comfortable. Even on flights of a bit over an hour, snacks and a beverage service were provided.

Similar to my flight to Cairo, my return flight to New York was just as impressive. My only disappointment were the business class lounges at Cairo airport. There was no available seating, the interior of the lounges were dark and dated and the staff were not very welcoming. However, my overall experience of Egyptair was one of being surprisingly pleased. I was very impressed with the boarding process in Cairo. There was a dedicated lane for business class at the gate which resulted in no waiting in any line at all once boarding commenced.

This was certainly not among the top of my business class experiences, but for a direct flight to Egypt for a price that is a fraction of many business class flights, I was very pleased with the service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/3c/b0/e9/jonahnj.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonahNJ,jonahNJ wrote a review Apr 2019,jonahNJ,"Pennington, New Jersey",11435 contributions,581 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r670030318-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Surprisingly enjoyable Business Class experience,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well, luckily I'd read reviews before taking this trip so I had a good idea what to expect.  Sadly I wasn't disappointed.  Talk about lacklustre.  The flight attendant serving our side of the plane was downright rude.  She dropped a wet towel on my computer keyboard at the beginning of the flight - no apology, just an arrogant stare.  Rolled her eyes when I asked for mint tea, despite the fact that it was written on the menu, and gesticulated at my dinner tray because she didn't like the fact that I'd stacked some of my daughters plates on my tray (done in order to help her so that she wouldn't have to lean over so far!). Food is served covered in plastic wrap which they don't take off.  They didn't collect our pre-take off drink glasses so we were left clutching them as the plane took off or they would have rolled down the aisle and smashed.  The seats are angled and you can basically put them in that position before take off and they won't ask you to put them in the upright position - anything goes apparently.  The last straw for me was when I got up to go to the bathroom and the flight attendant was sitting on the jump seat with her legs crossed, she made no attempt to move them so that I could get to the door.  I had to step over her legs!  On leaving the bathroom, I had to stop myself from purposely slamming into her legs I was so angry.  The attitude was extraordinary.  I don't expect that at any price, but in business class when you're spending thousands of dollars it is completely unacceptable.  Ironically, we flew Egyptair domestically a couple of days later and the flight attendants were very nice.  Perhaps this flight attendant had seniority to get the JFK-CAI flight and no longer felt the necessity of being nice.  Also, don't expect any drinks, including water, to be served after the initial food service.  Luckily I was able to grab a few bottles from other seats that didn't have passengers.  Otherwise it could have been a thirsty 10+ hour flight!  If Egyptair management should care to read this review, we flew on April 23rd in seats 9H & 9K.  Your flight attendant needs to be fired!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucy-Miss,Lucy-Miss wrote a review Apr 2019,Lucy-Miss,"Boulder, Colorado",133 contributions,111 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r669621363-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Awful!

However, 10 hours was a little too long as the seat didn't provide enough cushion comfort, but it was nice not to have a stopover. Food was decent.

On the way back the airplane had technical issues and the passengers were informed only 40 mins after the scheduled departure that the flight was delayed (by that time we had already guessed it ourselves!). Seats are old and uncomfortable. The airplane was dirty in general (the provided pillow had hair from other passengers on it). The food on the way out was edible. On the way back, after eating a couple of bites, I found a huge piece of hair in it (it was clearly contaminated because I had gastrointestinal disorders starting some 3 to 4 hours after the meal and for the next 3 days).

"I just flew on egypt air four times during my trip to egypt.  Things to expect:  Your reserved seats to be changed with no responsibility from the airline.  Don’t expect anyone to answer the customer service lines and to get an emails response for 6-8 hrs.  Said response will fail to clarify the problem and leave you in the lurch.   So check in early -48 hrs.  This happened to my group twice.  Both times they gave away my window seat and one of the times they even split me and friend up into middle middle seats at the back of the plane.  We had reserved tickets 5 months in advance but told said reservations are not guaranteed.  At the airport, you may find a lack of order in the boarding process that leads to a chaotic cattle call.  Don’t expect alcohol on transcontinental flights like you would get on emirates, Jordanian, Qatar, etc...  Our Flight  home didn’t even have Diet Coke.  Attendants twice put off our requests and failed to follow through later.  Also served juice and water comes in dentist office spit cups.   The meal will have metal utensils but they mostly consist of  plastic wrapped carbs.  Egypt AIR also skimped on their movie entertainment licenses.  Perhaps 2-4 western new releases.

"First time to use Egyptair, which was the only company that offered the cheapest ticket with a straight connexion. The flight from Brussels to Cairo left on time. We had a lot of rough turbulences making some passengers (including me) a bit uneasy but everything was fine and after our 4h25 min we arrived on time in Cairo.  Crew members were very polite and helpful. We all received headphones, blankets, pillows, plenty of free refreshments, cake, food tray. The crew comes by regularly with free coffee, tea, juice,..All seats have tv screens from which you can choose music, movies in different languages, documentaries, kids program, also the progress of the plane toward your destination. I always find this function useful. Being tall I found that the seats had more leg space than the companies I used in the past. The food was not bad, chicken, rice, vegetable.

"Flying from Cairo to Hurghada has got to be better than a seven hour bus trip, doesn’t it?
Sadly no. I could have got back home quicker if I’d walked.
Flight MS339 was due to take off at 17:45 on Thursday afternoon and as I arrived at check in, the departures staff told me to “Hurry up, take off is in forty-five minutes!” So, up I hurried, jumped down several flights of stairs and practically threw my boarding card at the unfortunate gate guardian.
“You going to Luxor?”
“No, Hurghada, look, your display says MS339 boarding now.”
“Oh, that’s wrong, this is the Luxor flight, yours has been ‘rescheduled to 20:30.”
“But Check in just told me to hurry up, and I did.”
“No they didn’t.”
“Er.... “ What’s the use, I’ve experienced this kind of pig-headed denial of the obvious too many times to think its worth arguing.
So, I waited until 19:50 when the flight was delayed for “ten minutes only” then at 20:15 we were told, definitely take off at 20:30, at 20:27 the gate was still closed so, “What time is boarding, when do we fly?”
“Nine o’clock, for sure.”
“Are you certain?”
“Yes.”
By 21:15, so many lies had been told it was becoming a farce. When the next boarding time of 21:35 was given, nobody believed it and some had gone off for a smoke hoping that somewhere in this benighted airport they could find a lighter. That was wishful thinking as only one of the display screens was working, only one of two coffee booths was open and it only had a few shots of espresso left and a solitary, fluorescent red and yellow cake which throbbed in the fridge like a particularly painful pustule right on the end of your nose.
Finally we had liftoff at 22:00 and a comfortable flight to Hurghada.
It was only in the morning when I unpacked my overnight bag that I found that my mobile Wi-fi box and an Apple battery pack had been stolen from it.
I wonder if anyone else on that flight had their bags raided while we held in undignified, ill-informed purgatory at Gate F31, CAI?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284alistairn,Alistair N wrote a review Apr 2019,Alistair N,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",101 contributions,57 helpful votes,Cairo - Hurghada,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r667572005-EGYPTAIR-World.html,A Flight to Forget,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"With some delay on Amsterdam due that it seemed to be rather busy with flights, took off wit half an hour delay which was almost made up during flight.
Nothing to complain about !
Friendly staff bringing drinks and food and although it is aircraft food it was “ok”.
Arriving at Cairo, not for the first time, you have to know the drill. Get your Visa, go inline for customs control and just wait until your luggage arrives.
This time everything was ready within half an hour but this can easily be an hour or more. If you’re not used to these kind of delays, don’t go to Egypt because it not only happens at the airport ;-)
Just observe and go with the flow !
Enjoy your stay, Egyptians do their best to please you and of course try to earn some money from you.
Small tips are appreciated!
Always go for half the price they ask and end up somewhere in between.

"I have never been treated so badly in my 22years of flying.
My flight was delayed in Sharm thus making the connection flight very short.
I asked the Egypt air representative to confirm that Pi would make my flight.
I was advised on 3 different occasions that the flight would be waiting for me and 8 other passengers.

LIE number 1

Upon arriving the 9 passengers were told that the flight did not wait for us.
So you can expect that we were all very unhappy.
No effort was made to find another airline, we were told that we had to wait until the next flight which was 7 hours later.

We asked to sit in the business lounge but a number of excuses were given - they were not authorised to provide access.

By this stage we had been given the run around - standing around given a number of options and excuses.

The lack of empathy, complete lies from all the staff, asking to speak to a supervisor being ignored and a simple request to sit in the lounge for 7 hours was like pulling teeth. I would say pulling teeth would be much more pleasant.

I have travelled extensively around the world and this has been one of the worst experiences with an airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/7e/d6/da/milo3056.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milo3056,Milo3056 wrote a review Apr 2019,Milo3056,"Melbourne, Australia",85 contributions,57 helpful votes,Sharm El Sheikh - Cairo,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r667219666-EGYPTAIR-World.html,LIARS,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight from Sharm El Sheikh to Cairo was delayed for over an hour and to make matters worse, our original layover in Cairo was only 1 hour 5 minutes. So with that said, we would now have only 5 minutes in Cairo to catch our flight home! Well, the pilot was able to get us on the ground in Cairo with 20 minutes to spare. The crew on the flight from Sharm El Sheikh had us waiting at the exit door so we could get out of the plane first and then rushing through the airport. We were skeptical as we had to go through a security check point and knew that this sometimes requires 10 minutes alone. The Egypt Air crew on the ground, was waiting for us and got us rushed straight through to our gate. We were minutes from the takeoff of that flight when we reached the gate. Simply amazing, we did it!!! As soon as we were on the plane and seated, the plane was taxing down the runway. Egypt Air employees went out of their way to make sure we got on our flight!!

"Suffered a challenging flight from Cairo to Toronto on April 4. Plane was full, old and shabby. Was asked to move to accommodate another passenger who had a bad back. Didn't mind that so much, but when I got to my new seat, the guy already sat there became very difficult and belligerent with the cabin crew who had asked me to move, and I stood around for a while while they argued. All of this in Arabic - I wasn't actually engaged in any of this. Not pleased, as I was woken to be asked to move, and then a poorly organized exercise. Not comfortable at all, so an 11 hour journey seems like an eternity.
I would not recommend Egyptair over any other. The plane was elderly and the state of the cabin threadbare and tired.

It happened at terminal 2 in Cairo airport when boarding the Egyptair flight to Amsterdam.

Overall the service with Egyptair from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Amsterdam was good. Staff was correct. Food was okay, except for the breakfast buns (very dry). Inflight entertainment for me was sufficient (watched two movies) and read an Egyptian newspaper in English. Modern terminal 2 in Cairo is definitely an improvement if you are in transit.

Would fly Egyptair again. Hope they improve security procedures. Passengers with special status of whatever kind should not be exempted from strict procedures.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/24/3c/48/2c/robert-o.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert937,Robert O wrote a review Apr 2019,Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",3406 contributions,6919 helpful votes,Bangkok - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r665355865-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Security concern,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The option of flying direct from South Africa to Egypt is great.
The A330-300 going from Egypt to Cairo had inflight entertainment but the return flight, also A330-300 had the old radio next to an ash-tray and random small screens on the ceiling of the centre aisles. There were no personal entertainment screens and no USB ports for charging a phone or tablet. For an 8 hour flight in 2019 competing with global airlines, this is quite sad.
On a positive note, the older plane was more comfortable with softer seats and a foot rest.

The food was good, however, the service was poor. The young flight attendants assisted as best they could but the older male flight attendants were rude and were as if they were fed up with their job and forced to be there. The old guys also seemed very scared when the plane went through minor turbulence and rushed to their own seats very quickly.

The allowable luggage for Economy Class is only 1 x 23kg piece and 1 8kg hand luggage. Its not very clear online (the egyptair website does not work) and they do not respond to emails when asked the question.

I pre-booked my seat and paid extra for it. When checking in at OR Tambo International (South Africa), I was first given the wrong boarding passes (someone elses) and after trying to resolve the issue, my wife and I were given random separate seats. Fortunately the Egyptian manager who was very friendly and accommodating assisted and arranged seats for us together even though hit wasn't what I booked. We were placed at the row with extra leg room. This is normally at an additional charge so we thankful for the assistance. The downside was it was located in front of the toilets so lots of traffic and a stench throughout the flight. This should be noted for those wanting to pay extra for leg room.

For an international airline, Egyptair lags behind others and should address service, cleanliness and the internal plane services.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/01/9f/15/riyaado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riyaado,Riyaado wrote a review Apr 2019,Riyaado,"Johannesburg, South Africa",136 contributions,23 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r665115705-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Old, dirty yet comfortable flight with no in-flight entertainment and poor service",Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Long ago, when I was young, flying was exciting, with the Canadair vibrating with the power of four Merlins, the stars dancing in unison at night, the navigator making his way through the passengers to climb up a ladder to the astrodome to take star sights with his bubble sextant, and the steward cooking a four course dinner on board. No classes in those days. It was an adventure, but now the only thing one can say about flying is that it is efficient, but boring. Egyptair is no better and no worse than any other airline. This plane showed it's age, rather shabby and a little elderly, and of course, there is no alcohol on board.

"We rose at 5 am on February 9/2019 to arrive on time for our flight from Luxor to sharm el Sheik After we arrived at the airport, we where notified that the 7 am flight had been canceled and that we where placed on the 7:30 am flight. No problem until that flight was delayed for almost an hour. We arrived into Cairo for our connecting flight just as they closed the gate, while we we where rushing down the hallway. Yes, they apologized, but the next flight wasn't until late that evening, at that time. After a very blunt discussion, we where placed on a flight that was scheduled for around 4 pm. They also agreed to put us up in an airport hotel as we where very tired. Well, it took a hour for the hotel shuttle to arrive, even thought we where repeatedly assured it would be along in moments. The room that was provided to us at the Cairo Novotel was the most disgusting room I have had the misfortune to stay in for a very long time. The mattress was worn out and stained. The pillows where also stained from body fluids. No other room was available for us to move to as it was still before noon and non of the overnight rooms had been cleaned.. Very little sleep was achieved. The meal that the hotel provided was very good. When I addressed this room with the Egypt air attendant, nothing was offered for compensation.
We arrived at our destination 8 hours behind our schedule and where put up in a very nasty room, all at the hands of Egypt air. This is by far, NOT my favorite airline.
They did attempt to provide us with a room, but these rooms are NOT the same rooms that I would be provided with as an overnight customer, but rather airport standby rooms. Cheap and far below a normal standard. I take that as the company's attitude towards its traveler.

We took this flight from Beijing - Cario - London last summer. It only cost £700 for one way. The aircraft is a little bit old but the seats are comfortable anyway. No alcohol on board but their strawberry juice is really tasty! Food quality is just average but the dessert is very nicely prepared. Transfer in Cairo is fast and efficient. The lounge is a bit crowded even in the early morning.

"After reading all of the reviews for the direct flight from JFK to Cairo, i was so hesitant.
Yes, after 9 hour flight, the aisles were littered. This was due to the people on board who were pigs not the airline's fault. You can not take bottle water on board. They serve water in very small cups.I suggest taking an empty container and have them fill with water after on board.
The service is routine with no 'may i get you something"". There are foot rests. Food is OK. Personnel do not smile easily but that is their culture. Movies limited so load up that ipad. I was told exit rows are no extra charge. if exit rows are free, you may want to check on bulkhead. Egypt air is a DRY flight with no alcohol. The flight was no where as bad as some reviews so don't be hesitant.

"Egyptair is actually a very friendly and reliable airline. In all the years, I have used them I can not remember a delayed flight. The long haul product on this flight was on the A330 airbus. The check in was fine and the EVA air lounge was excellent. The Business class is full flat beds which are comfortable. It was a late night flight and I was surprised that they insisted on serving dinner at 0230 !! Unfortunately, the catering nearly always really lets them down.  it is always poorly presented and the main dishes are always rank. So I ignore all food when on board. However, i will give them there due that they leave you alone to sleep for the entire flight until landing. Announcements are minimal but the actually working staff, if you need them, are always engaged and friendly.   The atmosphere is more of a 70's  retro airline.. where staff are clearly selected from Egyptian elite society. I rather like that. A quirky plus is their inflght entertainment choice of films where often I have seen films that I have never found elsewhere on other inflight systems and some of them are refreshingly rather good. The airline is cheery, comfortable and fine for the odd friendly but respectful chat But make sure you dine elsewhere.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardgounie,edwardgounie wrote a review Mar 2019,edwardgounie,"El Gouna, Egypt",44 contributions,52 helpful votes,Bangkok - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r659291279-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Friendly staff and comfy seats... but forget the food,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

One row of seats were actually given to a family with small children.  That was pretty unfair to us.

When I tried to make a claim for my damaged bag they gave me some paper with the wrong email and a number that is not even valid.

"Having booked this flight and our seats in October of last year, and despite having CONFORMATION of our chosen seats, we were given three different seats in a different area of the plane !
We had booked specific seats because one of our party was disabled and needed to be next to the toilets.
When we complained at the boarding gates we ere given yet different seats , two of which were separate from the other !
This caused confusion on board because when it came to meal time one of our party who has specific dietary needs was not given her meal because they had changed our seats !
The staff were unwilling to rectify this because there was no mention of this on our new boarding cards. Eventually they did.

"Let me start with the plane itself - old, worn out seats, 2/3 USB ports were broken on my set of seats. The cabin crew lack basic customer service training. They are rude and impatient with travellers. Walking backwards down the isle, shouting ""coffee, coffee, coffee"" ... instead of politely asking if anyone would like some coffee... Usually don't turn up if the crew member button is pressed, but when they do - it's more than a few minutes later and they are usually quite annoyed by the fact you are bothering them with something. Toilet got blocked mid-flight and started flooding and stinking because most people would throw their papers inside it although there was a clear sign not to put your paper in it...

Now, to main part of my journey. I witnessed how Malaysian special forces police CARRIED A HANDCUFFED MAN with blindfold and earplugs on the plane + 3 other arrested men. And for every arrested person(with handcuffs, earplugs and blindfold) there were 2 police officers. They sat at the back of the plane, didn't interact with anyone.
The cabin crew tried to explain that the arrested people had overstayed their visa in Malaysia and got transferred to Bangkok where they were sent back to Cairo, but noone really believed her words... Why would anyone be handcuffed, blindfolded and with earplugs if they overstayed their visa. You must have done a lot more than that to deserve two police officers guarding you on a flight...

"When after many hours of waiting in Abu Simbel, Egypt for a flight to Aswan on to Cairo and beyond, two tour groups and several couples were told that a bus would be picking us up, taking us to lunch and that a plane was flying down from Cairo to replace the plane that was having mechanical difficulties. After lunch at the only available hotel, the Seti, we were hoarded back onto buses which we assumed were going to the airport. As it turned out, we were DRIVING to ASWAN from where we had come the day prior. No one told us anything. Had it not been for a tour company leader, we would not have known we were on the wrong bus going to a boat tour on the Nile. Calls were made and the bus stopped somewhere along the road, letting off a number of passengers as well as ourselves. Next thing we know, after asking untold questions receiving no answers, we were told that we would be stopping overnight in ASwan and at 3 the following morning, we would be driven to the airport for our flight to Cairo. Not only were we traveling business class and requested a refund for that portion of our flight that never happened, we were put up for a couple hours over night in a sleasy hotels where people complained of bed bugs and bugs in the shower ( which we did not take.) Response from EGYPT AIR was that in the future we would receive a 10% discount on our next flight. Did they seriously think we would fly Egypt Air again living in Phoenix, AZ? The only correspondence was through email and there has been no attempt to reach us via customer service and a voice on the other end of the line.

A different experience with British Airways had excellent customer service when a mechanical issue arose, a stay at an excellent hotel overnight, apologies, and calculated payment for all the inconvenience and loss of a day flying from London to Cairo on the second leg of our journey which amounted to over $1000.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/a6/a2/a4/carefreepat.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carefreepat,G and P Cohen wrote a review Mar 2019,G and P Cohen,"Carefree, Arizona",44 contributions,8 helpful votes,Abu Simbel - Cairo,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r656835747-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Extremely poor, frustrating service and no resolution on Egyptair",Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was on a double connection from Jeddah back to Boston. I had a long layover in Cairo and rested in the Egyptair lounge. It was one of the worst Star Alliance lounges I have been in, it was super cold inside the lounge and only one of the areas were opened at 5am in the morning. Having had a miserable lounge experience, I learned to lower my expectations when boarding MS 9010 on a A320 with 16 seats in J class.

The boarding process was relatively smooth was two lines for economy and star alliance gold and business class passengers.

The seats were creamy leather however still looked quite new and were a bit more comfier than the A330 flight from Jeddah. The seat controls were more sophisticated than North American carriers flying narrow bodies for regional flights with recline, lumbar, legrest and footrest extend options.

For this 4 hour flight there was even a Cerutti amenity kit, how awesome was that. It came with a comb, eyeshades, socks, toothbush and toothpaste, Aigner white lotion - a full kit, very impressed!

The flight attendants were very nice and hospitable throughout the entire flight, no alcohol is served on Egyptair. Once the flight was in the air, we were served our choice of juice along with biscuits. For the menu, they have a rather tacky, elementary school designed menu however there were 4 choices for main and appetizer and dessert. I had the meat and it was fairly standard. At the end of the meal, they passed out Egypt air 4 square chocolates.

The movie selection was quite extensive and the IFE was very easy to use. I finally had a 30 minute nap before landing.

All in all, it was a fairly comfortable flight with good service. Is it my favorite Star Alliance carrier? No - but I wouldn't object to flying it to/from Cairo for short distance for a narrow body.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/9d/c1/bd/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayeung74,Amos Travels wrote a review Mar 2019,Amos Travels,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",188 contributions,31 helpful votes,Cairo - Munich,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r656626925-EGYPTAIR-World.html,CAI-MUC -  Exceptionally good flight without expectations,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I got a really good deal on a flight to Dubai so took advantage of the promotion. It was my first time flying with Egyptair and I have no plans to travel with them again. The customer service was non-existent. I would try to ask a question and numerous times the staff looked at me and walked away. Some were nice but most of them had very poor customer service. The food was okay, nothing special. A few hours after our meal we were served sandwiches. I opened my cheese sandwich and the cheese had fungus all over it. I was shocked! I gave it back to the flight attendant who did not apologize or anything. He gave me a new one but I didn't eat it. I complained through email and they offered a 20% discount. I don't think that is a sufficient compensation for being served old and mouldy food on TOP of having poor customer service.

"We had 5 Egypt Air flights during a 2 week holiday in Egypt and Jordan.  All flights left and arrived on time.   On the short flights we were bused to/from the terminal.  Flights to Luxor had no films etc, but the Cairo/LHR films were dreadful in any case.We had confirmed seats before we flew for all of them.    My ticket came up as stand by at Heathrow and took a while to sort out;  we were given different seats, not together on two other  flights and we witnessed a row at Amman airport when one guy (this was in arabic) was furious as he had a confirmed seat and something had gone wrong - 3 Egypt air staff got involved and it got quite heated.Food was airline average but we were pleasantly surprised to get food plus a drink on the three short (max 94 minute) flights.   No alcohol available.Transits were reasonable - water removed at Cairo and long queues for checking hand luggage at the gates.    We had binoculars in our checked luggage.   This was held back entering Jordan and after a delay, we had to let the security people check their strength before we could claim the luggage.   This happened to 2 others on the flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollySalisbury,hollySalisbury wrote a review Mar 2019,hollySalisbury,"Salisbury, United Kingdom",184 contributions,86 helpful votes,London - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r655964961-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Airport admin needs an overhaul,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have nothing negative to say about EgyptAir. My experience with them was as good or pleasant as with any major airline on a lengthy flight. The plane was clean, bathrooms supplied, flight attendants polite and attentive. Food was plentiful, drinks including tea and coffee always available.

True, the entertainment choices were somewhat limited, but enough to occupy you during the journey.

I read horror stories about EgyptAir, and because of numerous complaints about lost luggage I brought two carryons. But to the best of my knowledge, nobody in our group had their luggage lost with EgyptAir. One couple received their luggage four days later, but it was AirCanada's fault.

The flight there and back is on a Boeing 777  The aircraft was clean and neat the crew was ok but there is a bit of a language barrier. The big surprise was the fact that they don’t serve alcohol on the flight or in their dedicated business class lounges. Not a deal breaker but a surprise non the less. The business class lounge in Cairo is abysmal. The lounges in Amman and Toronto are great because they are shared with other Star Alliance airlines. The seats in business are side by side and recline to flat but if you’re looking for a pod they don’t have them. The big advantage is they go direct and there is no big long connection somewhere in Europe. They don’t go every day of the week so check your dates carefully. 9hours and 20 minutes eastbound and about 11 and a half hours westbound enroute times. I would use them again just because they go direct from Toronto to Cairo,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383grahamd,Graham D wrote a review Feb 2019,Graham D,"Guelph, Canada",58 contributions,11 helpful votes,Toronto - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r655275378-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Ok,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok, I rarely review airlines. In fact, most airlines I've traveled with to USA, inside Canada, and out to Europe have either been a disaster or just ok.

I was preparing myself with very low expectations to avoid disappointments but ended up going on flights (to and from Egypt and internally within Egypt) that happened to be the best flying experience of my life.

The planes themselves were a more modern open head-space design, the entertainment system had both touch controls as well as a remote (though not that many good movies), there was way more leg space than a typical flight and the seat in front had a leg piece below it for you to rest your feet on during the flight. Seat were comfortable and a little pillow was provided to everyone which could have been placed behind your back to give you lumbar support. For the first time ever I didn't feel uncomfortable with backache in a flight and this was actually one of the longest direct flights I've been ....8.5 hours.

Food was amazing! Breakfast, lunch and dinner tasted great. High quality utensils (metal not plastic! and a smart spork!) were provided along with wet towels and good quality cups for tea/coffee. The meals were presented in beautiful individual containers that were ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing.

A high quality support bag was provided to everyone with amenities such as a portable brush, ear bugs, ...

Overall I found the attention to detail for customer experience impeccable so much so that I would gladly right this review. I actually wish I could fly with egyptair to other places.

Only downside is that for some reason the airline doesn't allow printing of the boarding passes when you check in online and forces you to do it in person at the airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/34/a1/cd/bruce-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PolarWolf,Bruce A wrote a review Feb 2019,Bruce A,"Toronto, Canada",21 contributions,5 helpful votes,Toronto - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r655099320-EGYPTAIR-World.html,One of the best flying experiences of my life,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We chose a package holiday in Egypt that included a cruise down the Nile from Luxor and a few days at the coast. The tour operator chose Egyptair to provide the flights.
Our outward flight direct from Heathrow to Luxor was on time, comfortable and relaxed. Food was OK and the plane (737) was nearly new.
Return flight was from Hurghada to London via Cairo. The first leg was in an old Embraer - no problems but the usual signs of wear with frayed seat belts and worn seats. But no worries and the flight was on schedule.
Cairo airport was busy and lacking in refinement, but acceptable. Egypt is in Africa, after all.
The second leg from Cairo to Heathrow was again in a modern 737. No problems.

"Simply put, Egyptair is a good airline now. Things changed dramatically after their Star Alliance experience. And during the past few years, Egyptair has taken strides in passenger service and luggage handling.
And I can tell that they have progressed dramatically in overall safety. The Star Alliance inclusion saved Egyptair. They are a different carrier now.

But what didn't improve yet?
The Food.
If I fly from Cairo, and I only fly Business Class, dining is the last thing I want to do. God help those in economy.

Another item Egyptair must improve is the toilet. Maintenance and overall hygiene are average.

So, what is my final verdict?
Sure you can fly Egyptair. It is a hard working carrier trying to compete with the big boys. I do recommend Egyptair.

During meal service, the flight attendant attempted to give my special meal to the passenger in my seat. When I tried to inform her she ignored me. She never bothered to ask the Egyptian passenger to relinquish my seat. Later, when documents were handed out for those ending their travel in Cairo she, again, ignored my request for the form.

49 inch TV broken by this airline -no compensation

654676698

On my flight to Addis Ababa from Brussels via Cairo I had a 49 inch Panasonic TV as a checked in baggage. Upon receiving it in Addis ,the TV screen was broken. It can be clear from the damage on the package that they never handled it with care. I think they were just throwing it like an ordinary luggage. I reported by email to baggage services and their reply is that items like TVs shouldn't be included in checked in baggage.

It is surprising that they accept the TV as a fragile item and upon damage they claim that there is no compensation for such items. In the first place the list doesn't include TVs.

"Traveled by EgyptAir while visiting Egypt for a 2 weeks holiday, from Mumbai ( Flights MS 969 & MS 968). Scores well on timelines, comfortable seats & legroom, especially the adjustable foot rests, the blankets & pillows add to the comfort. But the grumpy faces of the Air Hostesses on both flights are a dampener & so is the food. We had selected Spl meals from the list offered by EgyptAir itself ( e.g. Indian Vegetarian Meal - IVML ) but the most annoying part was when the Air Hostess feigned ignorance about this in spite of being mentioned on boarding passes & asked us the meaning of this abbreviation. They totally messed up with all 3 meals in our group. Also, Cheese & Butter was served only when we demanded as only bread was served in the plate. Request for addi juice or tea/coffee were not fulfilled. As a policy this airline does not serve hard drinks as a part of their culture & religious beliefs, but such religious beliefs should not be enforced on international routes. The In-flight entertainment on the new aircraft B-737-800 on return journey was a pleasant surprise. We traveled on EgyptAir as this was the only option of flying Non-stop between Mumbai & Egypt. Overall fares charged are a bit higher than other airlines in Asia & North Africa.

"My wife and I flew back on recently on EgyptAir. It was not my first trip with the airline, nor am a novice traveller. So, my views have a varied baseline and stems from view airlines...compared to EgyptAir.

The cabin was clean, neat and we got what we paid for - economy size everything. Leg room is as good as most flight in this category. Sadly, we were delayed for an hour ( & some change). Very little announcements were received and passengers were mostly tired, frustrated and in need of sleep. It was passed midnight when we finally took off...homeward bound.

The crew on EgyprAir are always militant and serious when serving you. This crew were no different. Very little friendliness was shown, unless you were from Egypt...Yip, it was obvious that some smiles and friendly chats were reserved for their fellow countrymen. I got the usual, ""yes"" when asking for an extra item or simply water...but didn't always got it... This cam from the crew lady who was driving the food cart down the isle and serving - no - dishing out our food. My View is, if you work in a services industry and you know you are expected to serve passengers - at least try to smile and to be friendly.

The quality of the dinner was good. Beef or chicken still has not gone out of fashion in these budget sections. As long as it is good quality food, we are always happy.
Breakfast was cold, sold croissant (cannot call it old) and some cheese and fruit. I gave trying to neatly cut the croissant after it was easier to break it by hand.... Seriously no apology not remorse for serving us this bad meal. Desperate and hungry passengers ate what they could - i drank my juice and ate the cheese slice....

As for comfort = none to be found. Entertainment system - we had some good items on menu to keep us busy while we tried to ignore our legs cramping up.

Overall, I hope I do not have to choose to fly EgyptAir again.

The main points why I chose Egyptair was the attractive price, flight and transfer time plus Egyptair is a Star Alliance Member which I collect miles on. Moreover the Egyptair Business BUSINESS fare was almost half the price of British Airways or Thai PREMIUM ECONONMY i.e. £1200 vs £ 2200 on BA or TG for an inferior product.

Highs:
- Easy checkin in London offering Air Cananda Lounge Access in T2
- Fast Track Star Gold Lane Security in LHR
- Easy and quick Priority Boarding
- Friendly welcome on Board their B777-300
- Clear and good security briefing
- Luxurious amenity kid
- Spacious setting with almost fully flat bed, large screen and good VOD
- Priority Lane vouchers for BKK immigration (took me 10 minutes from plane to luggage)
- Efficient luggage delivery respecting priority luggage
- 150% miles credited to my Star Alliance Account within 24 hours (LHR-BKK 10.000 miles)

Lows:
- Service is prompt but not consistent and not the most charming. Once meals are served there is not much to expect by inflight personnel
- Food is not great but plentiful
- Egyptair do not serve alcohol (bring your own is possible)
- Planes are not the newest and cleanest but feel safe
- Cairo's Egyptair Lounge is not up to Star Alliance standard, Once more: no alcohol
- When buying your own Alcohol in Cairo make sure it is in a sealed bag, security are confiscating it right before you board in Cairo (security screening)
- CAI-BKK A330-300 Business Seats are not fully flat but manageable

Seen that there are several flight-options between London and Bangkok, direct or indirect Egyptair beats all fares on Business by far and is excellent value for money. Connection time is 3 hours each way making the trip slightly longer than a direct flight. The most important is that I felt safe and therefore my 4-star rating.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f1/c1/fa/viatornarra.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViatorNarra,ViatorNarra wrote a review Feb 2019,ViatorNarra,"London, United Kingdom",245 contributions,247 helpful votes,London - Bangkok,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r653254793-EGYPTAIR-World.html,London - Bangkok via Cairo Business Class,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew Egyptair because it was the only way to get from Amsterdam to Cairo. It wouldn't be our choice in future as there were more cons than pros.

Cons
No staff at the departure gate until well after advertised boarding time and no announcements made
Left 20 mins late, not the pilot's fault
Aircraft uncomfortably hot all the way
We had a crying child 2 seats from us for 3/4 of the way (unfortunate for all of us)
2 young kids running and squealing up and down the aisle constantly! Uncontrolled by staff or parents.
Entertainment selection was dreadful - ""popular movies to watch"" John Wayne for goodness sake!
Seating was airline average - cramped economy seats.

Pros
Meal was nice enough, service was quick but snippy
Boarding was fairly orderly

"The whole experience of Egyptair was poor. The seating allocation meant that seats were double booked. At the airport the flight was delayed but we were kept in a holding room after security with no water and the need to go back past security to the toilets. The seats themselves were broken. The earphones for the entertainment system were for another aircraft. The cabin floor was wet. The roof showed signs of water stains. The equipment for inflight catering was insecure and rolled around during takeoff and landing. The number of toilets was insufficient for a full aircraft on a 6hr flight. It was not possible to use Smart phones for entertainment even in flight mode. The staff were rude to passengers. On this basis I would not recommend this airline to anyone, however having said that they have a monopoly in Egypt so if you want to see the sights you have to travel with them. This was only one of 3 flights we did and the others whist not as good as some other airlines, e.g. easyJet, were acceptable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/a1/01/db/marpletraveller.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarpleTraveller,MarpleTraveller wrote a review Feb 2019,MarpleTraveller,"Marple, United Kingdom",1113 contributions,309 helpful votes,Luxor - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r652788472-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Very Poor Experience,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew from Toronto to Cairo via Vienna

The Austrian Airlines part was excellent, while I didn’t book on Egyptair from Vienna to Cairo my flight was operated by Egyptair.

The airplane was really old didn’t have personalized entertainment equipment instead it was 1 shared tv screen.

During the 4 hours flight I asked several times the cabin crew for coffee and every time I was told it was on its way but nothing came.

When I arrived one of my suitcases was soaked wet and all my clothes were ruined. I called office and no one answered the phone after 2 days of trying eventually someone answered and they told me that since I booked my ticket on Austrian airlines I should complain to them because they were only code sharing the vienna- cairo part

"Our overnite flight was almost full and with tight seating there was little comfort on the flight.  Service was impersonal with a 'take what you get' attitude on meals.  The staff had an attitude and seemed more interested in their own comfort than that of their passengers.  One steward moved me away from a small open area in the back of the plane that allowed me to stretch so that he could fold down a crew seat for himself.  Another felt compelled to point out that a few cups of water had already been poured when I took the liberty of pouring a cup fresh from the bottle.  Movie selection was terrible.  On the 4 flight segments that I took within Egypt the airline's distinguishing characteristic was lack of reliability...always late and once hours late.  In the terminals was the worst with the people in security actually looking for tips for moving a bag on a conveyer, in some places insisting on separate women's and men's lines and in others not, once requiring that everyone sign their names in a large book after going through security and then changing their minds in the middle of the line, offering no help in making sure containers were available for personal items being scanned, just a really poor customer service experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1tomm1,Tom M wrote a review Feb 2019,Tom M,"Quakertown, Pennsylvania",235 contributions,103 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r652601759-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Mixed experience on multiple flights,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Their aircraft had issues and it caused a cancellation of the flight.  This cancellation caused me to miss my connecting flights that just so happened were not booked together. EgyptAir's response to my complaints is it is not their responsibility to help out.  Even though it was due to a malfunction of their aircraft due to inadequate aircraft maintenance and inspections.

The airline is a dry airline (no alcohol will be served) however you can bring your own on. No ice though, was available on-board or tonic. So we made a screwdriver with the fresh orange juice.

"We were a little hesitant about traveling with such an unfamiliar airline, but we ultimately decided to fly with Egyptair because it is the only airline offering a non-stop flight from the US to Cairo. We had a great experience, and we are glad that we made the decision to fly Egyptair. The airline offers essentially the same service as an American airline. The planes seemed up to date and well- maintained. The flight crew were friendly, spoke English and offered good service.

During our trip, we flew Egyptair for both the international flights and for flights within Egypt, and we had good experiences with each type of flight.

For the international flights, a bag of toiletries such as toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, eye mask, ear plugs and earbuds were complimentary plus a pillow and blanket for each seat. In flight entertainment is available on the international flights, and there was a fairly good variety of movies but very few TV shows. The monitor and video system seemed a little dated as several of the button labels had worn off. WiFi is not available. Two meals were serviced on the international flights, and they were as good as meals on any other airline. One major difference from other airlines is that Egyptair is a dry airline, so alcoholic beverages are not available.

Our only complaint of this airline is that they don’t provide much water unless you ask, and even when you do ask, they only give you about 4 oz at a time. This is especially a problem on the return flight from Cairo to JFK because the Cairo airport doesn’t allow you to bring water on the plane even if you buy it after going through security. The bottom line is to be prepared to bug the flight attendants to bring you water.

Egyptair is a member of the Star Alliance (United airlines and Lufthansa are some of the other partners), so your travel with Egyptair will help you accumulate Star Alliance miles.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/a8/f8/ab/amydcrnp.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amydcrnp,amydcrnp wrote a review Feb 2019,amydcrnp,"Birmingham, Alabama",90 contributions,55 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r650199218-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Great experience flying Egyptair,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If you're used to flying Delta, Southwest, or other US domestic airlines, you'll find this a bit different. The flight itself and back (to Cairo) were actually very good and I have no complaints about that. The service, however is a different story. The flight attendants are cordial, kind and efficient during meal service, but not particularly attentive at other times. Mind you this is a 12 hour flight so there's plenty of down time. People need things and the staff is pretty much off duty after they've served meals (it seemed). the isles got pretty cluttered and dirty after a few hours, and nothing was picked up (paper, straws, etc) so trash just accumulated on the floor for the whole flight. We learned early on that if you want something, you have to go back to the galley and get it. Not really a problem for us because we needed to stretch and walk around a bit anyway. We also met and talked to a few of the staff members who were very friendly. The other plus about this airline, and one of the reasons we chose them was that they have a direct flight from the US to Cairo. Other flights stop in Jordan or Dubai or other places which makes for a longer day and more chances for luggage to get lost as far as I'm concerned. Basically you just need to be aware that if you fly this airline, it's a different bag than most US flyers are used to. Planes are old, and audio systems are average, Some movies but they aren't great. Our seats in coach were roomy enough for us and we are tall. If you travel internationally you have to be prepared for anything........in the US we're spoiled!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9870ENbarbarak,Barbara K wrote a review Feb 2019,Barbara K,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",124 contributions,56 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r650124477-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not an Upscale Airline,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Booking the ticket was not easy (even through Expedia) since you see a fare that you cannot get once you try to pay for the tickets. The checkin was smooth without much of a problem. The boarding and the takeoff were not. The plane started moving on the ground while several passengers were still standing and getting to their seats. This was a first for me.
Now to the poor quality of food items. One of the flight attendants bragged about how he avoided the airline food in 23 years of service with the company.
The plane did not have individual monitors for each passenger making it difficult for children to watch something suitable for their age. Everyone can only watch one movie.
For our return flight the checkin staff in Nairobi insisted that there is a rule (which we never heard of before on any airline) to plastic wrap the child stroller in a nearby stand...l suspect she was trying to benefit that stand with the $7 wraps...very strange.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614abdelghanie,abdelghani e wrote a review Feb 2019,abdelghani e,"Walnut Creek, California",76 contributions,60 helpful votes,Cairo - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r650026618-EGYPTAIR-World.html,An airline missing the love of its staff,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"NO wonder Egyptair has the reputation for being one of the worst airlines there is!
It is difficult to put into words how I felt about this flight experience except to say I was delighted when we landed.
First the good news. Both meals I had with Egyptair were good and staff were unswervingly friendly and helpful.
Now for the bad news. You can trot out any joke you like about old aircraft but this one should have been pensioned off years ago.
Powered by the very latest in elastic band technology, this plane could well rank as a museum piece.
Even though the flight was nearly six hours long there was a choice of one film to watch -- take it or leave it. The one I drew was a comedy about a dog, very fitting as this plane had gone to the dogs.
There was no personal screen in the back of the seat in front of me. In fact no-one had personal screens but had to try and follow the film -- if they bothered -- using a small screen which came down from the overhead luggage area. Naturally it was only one screen per two or three rows of seats! I haven't seen that way of operating in-flight entertainment for many, many years.
All the upholstery in almost every seat I saw was worn, my seatbelt took real effort to adjust and click into place and my meal tray was of the variety that folded away into the arm of my seat. It folded away easily enough but grimly refused to come out unless brute force was exerted.
Not only was there some questionable vibration from the aircraft but shortly after take-off I had water dribbling down the fuselage wall from above the window!
And as for going to the toilet?!! Well, with my early experiences it didn't take rocket science to work out that getting to the toilet before mid-flight might be a very good idea and it was. Still clean and relatively dry mid-flight but towards the end of the flight it underlined exactly what you can let yourself in for when you travel ""Cattle Class"". I won't give specific details. Let's just say it was unpleasant.
Even the public address system didn't always work and had a tendency to hum, whir or scratch for the first few seconds which obliterated the beginning of ordinary messages such as ""Please assume the crash position""!
And did I mention the delay flying out? Nearly an hour....because the incoming flight was late and had to be cleaned and refuelled. Perfectly reasonable excuse....unless more experienced passengers tell you that this is happening all the time!
Overall, the next time I fly in this direction I will take the financial hit and opt for a bit more comfort, better facilities and better timekeeping. None of that is available with Egyptair.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/8c/72/3b/singhasam.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singhasam,singhasam wrote a review Feb 2019,singhasam,"Weymouth, United Kingdom",3629 contributions,698 helpful votes,London - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r649878654-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Back to the Wright Brothers...and they were better,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The tour company booked this airline. From the 1st time that I called them their offices were closed - almost like bankers hours. When they finally answered I was transferred to another department and it took at least 28 minutes for them to answer. Now the flight over to Cairo. After the meal is served that's the end of the flight attendants. Not once did they come around to offer water - which is essential not to dehydrate on long flights. And the garbage is thrown all over the planes cause they didn't come again not once to collect the garbage. Very unfriendly crew. Luggage took forever to come out. And on top of it all the planes are very old and falling apart. I even tried to send Egyptair a compliant online and it can't be done. All 4 flights that we took were never on time and for no reason.

"We had checked in 7 bags for 6 passengers at Cairo airport for flight to Luxor on 2 Feb and only 5 arrived. Instead of rushing to get the bags to us on the next several available flights like any other airline, they continually lied about the estimated delivery time including telling us a flight that the bags were supposed to be on was cancelled when that was easily verified to be untrue on the airline website and completely disregarding the fact that we have elderly travellers in our group who need access to medication in their missing bags and hence, putting their physical well-being in danger. I was told by local Egyptians that the only way to ensure bags arrived on time with the flight you are on was to tip the airline staff. Absolutely crazy sounding but unfortunately I suspect this was the case in our situatiom. I would not visit again Egypt given this is the only domestic flight choice and I would discourage everyone I know from visiting given the level of outright incompetence and corruption.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/e1/06/66/ladybug789.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ladybug789,Ladybug789 wrote a review Feb 2019,Ladybug789,"Hong Kong, China",159 contributions,202 helpful votes,Cairo - Luxor,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r649723718-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not kidding when they say this is worst airline,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Their service is completely different depending on which country the plane is boarded at. From Accra to Cairo, service was crap. Flight attendants were rude! You ask for a blanket and they tell you it’s finished! Air craft was crap. Very unstable especially in turbulent areas. From Cairo to UK, it was still sub standard but much better service and aircraft. Quite discriminating! And oh if your flight has an overnight layover, please prepare to be held up at the airport in Cairo for long hours before finally being taken to a hotel after midnight! I practically finally settled down in the hotel and had to wake up in 2 hours to head back to airport. Everything was just so disorganized! And it was a return flight so I experienced this twice.

"Horrible experience from my first flight muscat-cairo and my flight back cairo-muscat,surprisingly to enter a ""charter flight"" as the flight is too conjusted, passengers are allowed to take 3 bags for cabin luggage, crew doesn't have a proper decorum when speaking to passengers,i.e chewing a gum and chating too loud. There is only 2 washroom for this flight where one has poop and none of the cabin crew even bothered to looked into it. The que is far to long for one washroom to accommodate. The flight is disgustingly smelly. Both flight was delayed and no notification from the crew.

"We initially flew to Cairo with Egypt Air as part of a Saga trip. The staff were ok on the way over. One of our suitcases was severely battered and dented when it arrived in Cairo. Our second flight was from Cairo to Aswan, one of our cases had not been put on the flight and we were told that it was because the flight was too full. Another 4 cases from people in our group had not arrived. We were told that the cases would be on the next flight, 2 were however ours was also not put on the next flight either with the reason being again that the flight was too full. Eventually after many calls from our tour rep the case arrived at 1.30am. Our final flight was from Luxor to the UK, I would suggest avoiding Luxor airport if possible. The flight was ok but apart from one Male attendant customer service is lacking.

"It is not the first time I try them and they never fail my concerns. Delayed. Service is very poor. Staff knows nothing about hospitality.

"I flew Egypt air to and from from Mumbai and even the flew domestic flights. It’s definitely a good airlines despite its review. The food was the best that I tasted amongst by brief international travel experience.

Our flight was around 5.40 hours and we had the overhead monitors to watch safety instructions and movies later. So it can be a bit boring if you can’t sleep on aircraft and you want to keep yourself entertained.

We also received complementary travel kits with tooth brush, toothpaste, earphones, socks, wet wipes and an eye mask.

I think the only drawback would be their English accent, which is quite understandable as we all have own accents and it’s difficult to explain and understand one another.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rupshaneogi,rupshaneogi wrote a review Jan 2019,rupshaneogi,"Mumbai, India",12 contributions,,Mumbai - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r647988731-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good airlines,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Flied on egyptair with a tour. To upgrade our sears the cost was more than our actual trip. Seats were very tight. Also movie and tv options limited for a 12 hour flight (same on outbound flight). Many times by the time the flight attendant arrived at our row they were out of items (or said they were) only to be able to get the item from another cart. (There was still another section behind us ) so feel bad that by the time they got to them I can’t imagine what was left.

"Travelled from London Heathrow to Bangkok via Cairo, Egypt in business class, sat in seat 9a for the first leg and 11a for the second. The day started well enough using Canada Airs lounge in LHR terminal 2, nice clean well appointed facility.
Boarding for the flight went well, I was aware prior to booking that Egyptair is a dry airline as are their lounges in Cairo, so this wasn’t a problem. The seat configuration was 2-3-2 and then 2-2-2. The seat design meant that I had to disturb the person next to me when I wanted to access the toilet, very old cabin design. No menus were given for the flights just trays of very unappetising meals brought round, I just ate deserts on each flight. The flight attendants were pleasant enough. There was no fast track facility through security in Cairo airport which was one of the most depressing dirty dingy airports I’ve ever experienced. The lounge I used was depressing, the hot food cold, the staff unhelpful and the selection of soft drinks poor. I have the return flights to ‘look forward to. 😭you get what you pay for I guess and I would have preferred to have flown economy with Etihad or Qatar for half the price with the benefit of hindsight.

"I picked EGYPTAIR because it was nonstop from the US and what better way to get excited about Egypt by flying the national airline of the country.  I was expecting incredible service and great hospitality.  I have recently traveled on British Airways, Air China and Royal Jordanian and wanted to try another international carrier.  I realize now that not all International airlines are better than standard US over the water.   Check-in at JFK was a little confusing but I have status with United with the Star Alliance so I was guided to a better situation than the average person. But I felt bad for the average person.   EGYPTAIR flies a 777-300 from JFK to Cairo and I was in seat 29A, the plane felt old when I got onboard and the seats need more cushion filling for such a long flight.  Seat 29A is a good window seat.   The entertainment is limited (maybe 25 movies) with only a few first run movies onboard and the rest where old.  Only 3 western style TV episodes total onboard.  Let me start off by saying the boarding at the gate is just ok, they form lines and people for the most part gather in each grouping.   When I walked onto the plane I handed the flight attendant a box of chocolates (I do this for all international flights to try and set the mood for the flight) and the gentleman flight attendant took the box and set it to the side and never said Thank You or anything.  The crew never acknowledged that I had given them anything so not sure who ate the chocolates.   Overall Impression of the flight crew - Just there to do a job, not overly friendly even when I would smile and say Thank You and Please.   Now don't get me wrong, not bad service just blah service.  Crew uniforms need to be updated along with the interior of the planes and some better attitudes would go a long way.    Meals and Service: For a 10 hour flight (12 coming back) you receive a drink and a hot meal (roll was cold and hard) about 1.5 hours after take off and then nothing until 2 hours before landing and you get another drink and a hot meal (croissant was very cold and not fresh) .    I have traveled on BA, Air China  and Royal Jordanian recently and was expecting at least the same type of meal and service but no, very basic.  No one walked around during the flight with water or refreshments.   They completely did not come around with any Duty Free items during the flight.  I guess you had to request it.   I would suggest EGYPTAIR mainly for the non-stop aspect of the flight and early afternoon arrival into Cairo (BA through LHR you arrive late in the evening) but go into the flight not expecting a ""wow"" factor or you will be disappointed.     I found the people of EGYPT extremely warm and friendly and appreciative to have me visiting and maybe EGYPTAIR should try and bottle some of that for the flight crew.  Now I will also say the flight crew from Cairo back to JFK was a lot better in attitude but still felt somewhat standoff (ish) to most people on the flight back.  One nice thing was we all got amenity kits, sad part is the Business class passengers received the same amenity kit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/b0/f7/6b/squish0904.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squish0904,Squish0904 wrote a review Jan 2019,Squish0904,"Garland, Texas",111 contributions,46 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r647434778-EGYPTAIR-World.html,JFK to Cairo and back - Good non stop and basic airline,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked 4 flights with Egypt Air mainly on the basis that no other operator had flights available for when we wanted them.

Having seen the reviews, we were a bit concerned, however we didn’t need to be. Our first flight from London to Cairo was fine and landed in time for our transfer to Luxor. We then took another internal early morning flight back to Cairo a week later and a final flight back to the UK.

Ok so Egypt Air are a tad no frills, but we found delays minimal, service and food ok and we had no issues with suitcases. Online booking was excellent and no charge to change seats. We did have a few flight time changes before our trip and communication could be a little better at the airport and during boarding.

"We flew with Egyptair to South Africa in December.  They were the cheapest option when we booked, but I was slightly apprehensive beforehand. In fact, the flight was fine.  We were an hour delayed in departing from LHR (on Cairo leg) and about 45 mins delayed on return JNB-Cairo leg; but in the grand scheme of things with long-haul flights, I don't think that's too bad.  Certainly I've had far worse delays with British Airways and South African Airways.The food on the flight was fine, again not dissimilar to our experience with other economy flights.  You're not there for the food.  Our stopover in Cairo wasn't too long and fairly seamless.  The air stewards were efficient and friendly enough.  Choice of movies inflight was fairly limited compared to other long-haul airlines, but that just forced me to try to sleep more.

"On the flight TO Rome, the food was average (though I feel you get slightly better meals, and are served first, when you choose a specific option, such as seafood or vegetarian).  Unfortunately, the pilot felt it was OK to smoke in the cockpit during the flight, so we had to smell his nasty cigarette smoke from before the meal started.  :-(  We complained to the steward, but there wasn't anything he could do about it at that point, he just apologized and said it was the pilot.  On the flight back FROM Rome, we had some of the best food we've had on EgyptAir (we definitely prefer when they're stocked in European destinations over flights from Cairo).

overall the take off and landing was great, didn't feel it at all, the crew is nice and friendly and will get you anything you need. The flight tickets is more expensive than before with less services & benefits, but this is how it is now with all flight agencies.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahmedamgad,ahmedamgad wrote a review Jan 2019,ahmedamgad,"Cairo, Egypt",6 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cairo - Frankfurt,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r646230455-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Terminal Changed without Notice, Food portions small",Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If you can avoid flying this airline, please do at all cost!!! This airline management should seriously retrain their staff both their check in representative on how to treat their clients.

Issue - Check in representative RANA NAGY #86156 was inept on how to be cordial. To add insult to the injury, upon complaining to the manager Karim # 26331, he was so disrespectful that both were talking in their own vernacular despite our request to speak in English so everyone can be part on how to mitigate the situation. When we requested for both to speak English, it was ignored so my partner had no choice but to try to record the conversation as a proof of their PROFESSIONALISM. This made the manager upset and RETALIATED by
asking security staff to inspect my partner's luggages and placed a mark in our boarding passes (4S's). The manager tried to INTIMIDATE US AND HARASSED US by threatening us that he has the authority to cancel our tickets and hold us in Egypt!!! UNBELIEVABLE DEMEANOR AND CONDUCT WHICH I THINK ANYONE DOES NOT DESERVE. I am also filing a report on Egypt Air website so their mgt is made aware of this.

My recommendation is to not use this airline if you dont want to be harassed and abused!!! The manager has no clue on what customer service is about.

"As a new resident of the UK and first time flyer of Egyptair I am extremely disappointed at my most recent experience with them.

I arrived two minutes late for my original flight on Dec. 28th and had to rebook and spend over 700 US to catch the next flight and extend my trip to Accra, Ghana. While paying for my rebooked flight the agent said she would email my new flight information and to this day haven't received it. I then proceed to check in where the next employee me states that the flight is overbooked and I need to check in my carry-on bag and assured me that it was going straight to Accra and would not be in Cairo where I had a layover.

I finally reach my destination and wait two hours for my bag that doesn't show up. I file a claimant in Accra and make sure to call and take a cab to the airport for a week straight just for them to give me no information, no contact information to Heathrow, and for them to only send out one email to all airports. I then have my partner call the JFK support number to see if they'd be better help. They sent him to three different departments before getting a contact number that I could only call during the week.

Here is where my frustration reaches its peak: I am in a foreign country, on a solo trip were I had to extend my flight with no protection/medication, or feminine products. As I'm reaching out to social media, calling all offices connected to Egyptair, and emailing, absolutely no one has reached out until I called JFK. Upon arriving to the terminal, I visited the main airline office in Accra and the manager there took down my information and told me he'd contact Cairo upon my layover arrival. I finally reach Cairo and they tell me they didn't receive any information from the other agents.

At this point I'm utterly disgusted by the level of miscommunication by your staff and their lack of urgency to help me find my bag. I finally arrive at Heathrow where I have to wait two more hours because they finally find my bag that NEVER left the airport and was placed in the tag-less department. On this trip I fell ill with the flu, my menstrual cycle started, and I had no clothes for two weeks, all because you team didn't do its best of communicating.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/17/b5/da/tahirah-tea-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tahirahteaj,Tahirah Tea J wrote a review Jan 2019,Tahirah Tea J,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,London - Accra,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r645769140-EGYPTAIR-World.html,The worst expeirce of my life.,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I took that flight which was on a B-777.  The plane departed almost an hour late although we boarded on time .   Seat was basic with the small monitor seems so far away . The monitor itself is on and off many times during the flight.    No Wi-Fi service and the old warning of not using the mobile during the whole trip is still there.     The food was tasty . That is the bright spot. The service was professional but missing the fine tuning touches .    We landed an hour late and it was hectic for me as I had to catch another flight in another airport inLondon.

Since they don't even attempt to offer you water beyond the meal service in Economy, I find it hard to believe that they would willingly accommodate you for an extra service request.

"Flight to Cairo, internally Cairo to Luxor, and Hugarda to Cairo and then Cairo to Frankfurt. Both international flights left late and neither made up the lost time which is annoying with connections. Whilst our luggage arrived others on our flight and in our group didnot arrive which led to a further hour and half delay leaving Cairo airport.
We were unable to check in on line and there was no option to order a vegetarian meal.
Service on board was average for the International flights and good for the hour long internal flights. Food on the international flights was better than some of the larger airlines flying long haul Australia to Europe etc. Limited entertainment package , hard to beat Emirates on this. Would fly with them again. No entertainment on internal flights and basic planes with less comfortable seating.

"Took a total of 6 segments (JFK-CAI, CAI-LUX, LUX-CAI, CAI-AMM, AMM-CAI, CAI-JFK). Decided to fly economy since the Business Class product looked so outdated & not worth the extra cost. Luckily got exit row/bulkhead seats for JFK-CAI flights for only $50/flight, so great deal & fantastic legroom. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing.

Plane for JFK-CAI flight was so tired looking that I actually felt a little unsafe. Things throughout the plane were broken & left unrepaired. In the bathroom: toilet seat pivoted because only 1 of 2 bolts in place, broken storage bins that wouldn't close, broken soap container bracket (no soap), no tissues (paper towels put into tissue container). It continued at my seat: the flip-up tv monitor wouldn't stay in place so I couldn't watch anything for the 12 hour flight, the tray wouldn't stay level so I couldn't use it for food or drink (had to share tray with neighbor). On the return flight 10 days later, the tray table was fixed & the monitor was slightly better (it was the same plane bc the same things were still broken in the bathroom, although it's possible that the bathrooms are consistently horrendous across their fleet...).

All that would have been bad enough, but the crew's attitude made it even worse. Although there were some good attendants, the majority were surly & rude. Except for the 2 meal/drink service, they never made made an appearance. The unfriendliness extended to many of the ground crew (check-in counters). The crew had a very erratic application of rules. They yanked away our pillows & blankets in the exit row & also refused us to use electronics during takeoff/landing. Yet they didn't make people put up their seatbacks during takeoff/landing & let people get up & open overhead compartments during taxiing to the gate. Crazy!!!

Surprisingly the AMM-CAI flight had the most advanced aircraft, but that had mechanical difficulties. We had to return to the airport after we took off & sat on the tarmac for an hour + without any explanation. Eventually we took off again without any explanation.

Hopefully will never have to use Egyptair ever again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyctravelr,L C wrote a review Jan 2019,L C,"New York, NY",351 contributions,364 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r645423709-EGYPTAIR-World.html,We survived (barely),Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had a lot of EgyptAir experiences, we flew JFK-CAI, CAI-Luxor, Aswan - Abu Simbel, Abu Simbel - Aswan, Aswan to Cairo and CAI - JFK.  I can say that at no time did I feel unsafe.  The planes seemed mechanically well maintained.  The short domestic flights within Egypt are on some wonderful little Embraer jets, which were very comfortable, US needs more of these.  My biggest complaint is the CAI-JFK leg.  First, there are multiple security screenings, that's great.  But, they do not allow any water on board at all.  Anyone that purchased water at the airport prior to boarding had it taken away. That's fine, I appreciate extra security measures.  What wasn't fine was that the beverage service aboard a 12 hr flight back to JFK amounted to about three ""shots"" of fluid, under 8 oz total.  Just not enough for this long of a flight.  Seats on the 777 were 3-3-3 and had a leg rest that went up or down, that was nice.  The seats were fine, I was unable to sleep.

"Took a short-haul flight from Cairo to Luxor and it was a rather smooth and uneventful flight that lasted about an hour.

For the one hour flight, they still served cookies and water which was surprising.

Seats were good for an hour flight and it was smooth from take off to landing.

"Chose Egyptair but wish we’d have gone with BA, as only 5 hr flight we went economy. Checkin at London was impressive, chap was very humorous and made us feel really good. On board seat is as you would expect, entertainment is poor, very few choices, not nearly as much choice as other airlines eg BA, Emirates, Qatar etc. Blanket provided was of terrible quality and on leaving plane my shirt was covered in fibres (made sure i didn’t use on way back). Food was ok. Airline is completely dry, no alcohol served. Toilets not clean after a few hours in flight and suggest you avoid at all costs. Flight on return was a small 737 and packed, surprising given it was flying to LHR. My biggest concern was on the way back all the overhead lockers were full and flight attendants couldn’t fit passenger across aisles bag, so used one of a few unused seats. Placed bag unsecured in the foot area of the centre seat, i thought this was a real safety issue, having been on flights with much turbulence not to mention the poor person by the window having his access restricted. I made my concerns known and was brusquely brushed off by attendant. My recommendation, Fly BA or any other airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/ac/d3/d4/martin-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJGUK,Martin wrote a review Jan 2019,Martin,"Solihull, United Kingdom",904 contributions,714 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r643985252-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Holiday Trip,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good flight. Every seat was taken. We were served breakfast, lunch, then a snack before landing. Flight was normal, Flight left on time and arrived on time. Trip was non-stop 12 hours from gate to gate. Flight entertainment nothing to brag about. Much of the movies are in Arabic. Not really a wide variety of choices. Was a day flight all the way so a good part of the flight the window shades were pulled down. Someone was sitting in my seat when I got on board but eventually got that straightened out as I paid in advance for a window seat so I could take some videos sitting at the window.

Passenger in front of me had his seat all the way back. It never bothered me until lunch was served. That's when I could not fit the tall cup on the tray. I tapped him on his shoulder to tell him to move his seat up a bit so I can place my cup. He seemed a bit annoyed that i would even make such a request. Had he not done it I would have called one of the flight attendants over. The nerve of people to think it's okay to have a seat all the way back into someone's face as if that is how we go about sitting at work and in public spaces.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/e1/39/62/sam107.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sam107,sam107 wrote a review Jan 2019,sam107,"Brooklyn, New York",386 contributions,140 helpful votes,Cairo - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r643877211-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Nice Daytime View of the Nile,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Recently flew 4 legs with Egypt air (JFK to Cairo, Cairo to Dubai, Johannesburg to Cairo, and Cairo to JFK) and overall they were pretty good.  Legroom was decent, food was a hit or miss, and the entertainment was a hit or a miss as well.  Movie wise there was an adequate selection but when it came to music download your own playlist because this was horrible.  All of the flights were clean and all were on time except for our flight from Cairo to Dubai.  Somehow, we were severely delayed because our flight doubled as a cargo carrier where pallets of stuff required loading.  Due to this delay I actually missed my first night in Dubai and instead arrived in the early morning. The one thing I noticed about Egypt air is that the air pressure on these planes is almost painful. I’ve never had this problem with other flights but on each one of their segments my ears felt as if they were going to explode.  Every baby on each of these flights were crying which was understandable but found it odd that this pressure was so noticeable on each of their flights. Luggage was delivered to the carousels to each of the carousels in under 30 minutes at each of the airports except JFK.  For some odd reason, it took over an hour for the bags to begin to appear and then it would be maybe upwards of 15 minutes before the next batch would appear.  Mind you two planes had landed and distributed their luggage on conveyors next to us and cleared out by the time we finally got our luggage. One thing worthy of a mention is that Cairo airport’s TSA will not allow you to bring beverages/water purchased within the airport on to their planes.  So make sure you open each of your bottles then take a swig before you hand them over otherwise these guys have drinks for days at the customers expense.  With that said – Egyptair should hand out a bottle of water to each of their passengers after takeoff.  I was so parched on the Cairo – JFK lag that I was grateful for keeping chewing gum on me.  The moisture in the air just got dry and the flight attendants issue you water in these tiny cups.Egyptair is very similar to Turkish Airlines which I also flew – however, I preferred the Turkish for the entertainment selection and normalized air pressure in their cabins.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJM0Mof1,NJM0Mof1 wrote a review Jan 2019,NJM0Mof1,Central NJ,128 contributions,88 helpful votes,Cairo - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r643641549-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Overall Not Bad,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Soon after the first announcement to fasten the seat belts and that smoking is strictly forbidden a strong smell of cigarette smoke spread inside the cabin. When mentioned to one cabin crew member, he commented: 'Oh, really? I don't smell anything!' The Egyptian lady on the other side of the aisle told him she also smells it. That was when the man then said that he'll look to it. Well, nothing changed. All the way until Cairo the smoke was there, sometimes so strong the cabin air got gray. We never got to know where the smoke actually came from, if it was the cabin grew themselves smoking or allowing someone to smoke.

"My wife and I recently travelled with Egyptair from Cairo to Luxor and back. It's around a one hour flight both ways. I had made sure we had rides setup back and forth from the airport with either the hotel or tour company. It's a 50min drive from Cairo airport to Giza, if you take Uber it will cost you less then $10 USD. From Luxor airport to Luxor downtown its only 20mins but no Ubers run in Luxor so make sure you have your ride setup.
The Airports.
First off there are too many security checks at Cairo airport everyone wants to look at your ticket and passport so be ready. Also I found the people at the airport are generally rude. They don't smile courtesy doesn't exist and they are always rushing. My experience with both airport wasn't that great but we made it on time and catched are flights. Once you get out of the airport you will find alot of taxi drivers trying to offer you a ride. Stay away don't follow them and don't hand them any paperwork.
Egyptair.
For a one hour travel time Egyptair was just fine they offered baverages the crew was generally nice. The plane were not fancy but it's 1hr you'll get over it. The main reason I recommend take the flight is because you waste too much time on a train. To save a few bucks it's not worth the hassle. If we would of taken the train that's almost a day and a half wasted just travelling. So take the flight look for cheap deals on Egyptair website search in there local currency and save yourself the time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tz1986,T.Z wrote a review Dec 2018,T.Z,,3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cairo - Luxor,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r642712997-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Save time with Egyptair and a little about Cairo and Luxor airport.,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Food was ok...served quickly and w a smile.

Plenty of water at the stations if you needed extra and were willing to go fetch some.

3 of my 4 flights were on time... 4th one was only 20 min late.... not so bad considering all the things that could affect an 11.5 hour flight.

"Started on a very sour note. My premium seat had been given away. When the Toronto Station Manager was approached, he bumped us off from the exit aisle seats we had paid for ($50 each), citing his arbitrary assessment that we were unfit for the seats. Never mind that the web-site had accepted our payment and the airline HAD allowed us to sit on these seats on the leg out. He told us to apply for a refund!

The cabin crew on Egyptair need training. They act like bureaucrats - dispensing service as favour. A small example is asking for a drink. The lady on our aisle had run out, so I was advised to hail the service on the other aisle for it. No 'Sorry, I'll get it for you'. Similarly, asked for a blanket, and the response - 'We're all out!'

"As usual, a good journey with lovely, friendly and efficient staff and a good flight overall - and on time  Sadly, this service only runs once a week, which is a shame as Luxor is a fantastic holiday destination that the holiday companies from the UK are still not including in their options, due to fear mongering. A great pity as they would find a huge demand for it should they have the business brains and common sense to start the route up again. Security at Luxor airport is excellent, extremely thorough, and Luxor is a very safe holiday destination as the locals are so friendly and welcoming, with a wonderful sense of humour. The food is also superb.The Egyptians in Luxor are missing - and badly need - our tourism pounds and with the superb weather and fantastic antiquities, and is, in my view (and extensive experience of the country), a much better holiday destination than the resorts on the Red Sea, which lack colour or originality and do not give a flavour of the 'real Egypt' at all; in fact they could just as easily be any resort in the Mediterranean.

"Warning: if you want to enjoy your flight, keep your sense of humour up.

The web page for booking seat did not work 48 hours before, as announced. For some reason, access to the seat booking was possible 24 hours before the flight. After booking seats, the check-in staff at airport just did not find trace of it, and had to book again the seats: an IT system forgetting about bookings?

Boarding was late some 15 minutes once, some 30 minutes another flight leg, which made no staff member any more reactive. This was not an Egyptian version of zen, just passivity. When transiting, expect to wait some 20 minutes in the plane whilst buses are ready but wait for some Godot, or some Osiris to come back.

Recommendation: do not sit too comfortably, as seats do not hold upright. Do not use earphones for entertainment, as the sound is barely audible anyway. Do not look too close at the picture, as the image freeze for 1 s every 4 seconds on a regular basis, or in some instance can be snowy-spotty and hardly visible. Do not try to enjoy colours if you do not like blue-tainted screens. Do not look too much at any subtitles, as these are too small and blurred. Do not be too choosy with any film, as the choice is quite limited. Do not expect much service, as cabin staff are there not to serve, but more to establish a presence.

After these recommendations for self-restrain, let us recognise that the food was ok.

A significant area for improvement is found in the way this airline organises transit in Cairo. The unwritten theory is that passengers with more than 6 hours to wait in Cairo are put into a nearby hotel, with no necessity to get a visa. A few blogs and fora bear some indication that the airline provides a hotel. The company itself is mute about it.

The experienced practice is that, in true Egyptian fashion, passengers have to negotiate the Egyptian way to get theory applied. Read: haggle, maybe lie, cheat and insist. The rule about transit hotel is not announced when booking a flight. Another rule, announced on-site as a IATA rule allegedly due to safety concerns, is that hotel is provided only if the company does not have any flight, available or not, that would reduce the transit connection time. Would it be too much of a challenge for the brilliant management of this company to communicate in due course (read: before flying, preferably when booking a flight with a connection) was the score is: passengers either spend the night at the airport, or in a hotel. Leaving such uncertainty until the last minute of a connecting flight is not the best way to handle passengers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127Fred,127Fred wrote a review Dec 2018,127Fred,"London, United Kingdom",581 contributions,198 helpful votes,London - Accra,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r640496653-EGYPTAIR-World.html,In True Egyptian Fashion,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Since the most remarkable landing in atrocious weather conditions in 1971 by an Egyptair pilot after a perfect flight, I have always tried to travel by them and have kept looking at reviews. This last flight was excellent; service, food, information from the crew, comfort etc was just right.  I usually find plane  seats uncomfortable, but this was almost perfect. Compared to British Airways, it was first class.  Check-in was smooth and frustrations at the airport were the fault of the Egyptian Security/Customs, not the airline.  The only criticisms are that my wife found the inflight entertainment a little sparse and on the outward flight we checked-in online and printed out all the forms and then had to go over it all again, quite ponderously, at the airport, much to the anxst of a number of other travellers as well.

"Have flown with EGYPTAIR many times in recent years using the route London - Cairo- Sharm El Sheikh return whilst the direct ban is on from UK to Sharm El Sheikh.

Generally I find the service from Egyptair average at best and the cost is quite high (around £500 return).

On my return last time in November I went to use the rear toilets ( only two toilets allocated to economy class meaning at least 150 passengers. )

Having stood for over 20 minutes I realised that only one toilet was in action and so I asked a steward if I could use the toilets to the front of the aircraft . He seemed horrified that an economy passenger would be allowed to use the front toilets and said no. I pointed out that there was a queue behind me and the average time waiting for the loo was about 30 mins and suggested that I would use the other toilets even if not allowed. He rushed off to consult the “flight manager” .

As I reached the toilet I heard a stewardess saying that the out of action toilet could, in fact, be used , but only as a toilet! Fortunately the argument was taken up by some younger Egyptian men in Arabic asking what else would we want to use the toilet for!

It transpired that the wash basin was not working and so one was unable to wash hands after using the loo. It was clearly preferable for passengers to have access to a toilet than not and surely hand wipes or other arrangements could have been made.

As I reached my turn to use the one toilet the steward to whom I had complained said he would escort me to the front of the aircraft to use the toilet. He received a less than polite response from me!

The second toilet was reopened and the situation improved , though I’m not sure what arrangements were made for hand washing.

The point of all this is that the measure of good service is how the supplier adapts to unexpected problems ( though a toilet out of action must happen fairly frequently) .
I was left upset by the rudeness of the steward and disappointed by the understanding of the crew to solve a fairly simple problem.

Now considering flying via Turkey as it’s cheaper and the service can’t be worse can it?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/f5/9a/28/sharmer1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharmer1,sharmer1 wrote a review Dec 2018,sharmer1,London,60 contributions,10 helpful votes,Sharm El Sheikh - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r640266725-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Average service but crew seem to be unenthusiastic and unhelpful.,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I took MS792 to Cairo. Excellent service from check in to the flight. The Lounges at Rome Egyptair use Alitalia. There are a number of lounges. I used two, I didn't realise gate E had a lounge beside it. Good food selection, fine quality wines and spirits as Egyptair is a dry airline I filled up at the lounge. Excellent service. On board the hostess took my overcoat and hung it in the Wardrobe, I notice a lot of European carriers don't offer this service anymore. The flight had very comfortable seats for a two to three hour flight. Cradle type, just two seats beside each other in business much better than the usual tight European business class.

"Okay, to be fair, I took a long and indirect route to get from London to Hong Kong with Egypt air. The good stuff - very efficient check in desk, the flights tended to take off and land on time and the seat space was adequate and on par with other budge5 airlines. There is the nice addition of giving out a free travel bag with toothbrush, eye mask, socks etc. However, as a vegetarian I found the food very dull and uninspired and on the 5 flights I had, I pretty much got much the same meal. They also don’t serve alcohol which is expected with an Egyptian airline but I do like a glass of red to send me off to sleep.

"I chose Egyptair specifically because it has direct flights from Toronto to Cairo. This saved a great deal of time and hassle compared to connected through somewhere like London. I didn't regret my choice. The whole process was seamless from the time I checked in to landing. The same on the return flight, which was from Luxor through Cairo back to Toronto. The only downside of that is the late hour of the flights - but that is to be expected on this kind of a journey.
My only complaint has nothing to do with the airline. Seated on the aisle, at my request, I nevertheless had a very annoying passenger beside me in the middle seat on the return journey. She hogged the armrest and generally kept me awake with her constant shifting and shuffling around. Ahh well.

"About 240 USD (total) for a one way flight from Cairo to Dubai (about 3 hours airborne). Comparable to mainline carriers in the US, Canada for one-way domestic flight of that timeframe.

The flight itself is quite good for a red-eye flight.

Departure time around 22:45 (Cairo time) and arrival about 4 AM (Dubai time). There is a full meal service. Taste and presentation are very much acceptable, but given that it's around midnight perhaps the choice of time when the trolleys roll out and the attendants start to plop meal trays over aisle passengers really needs re-thinking.

AVOD was the seat-back with WIRED control handle with the four ""play"", ""stop"", ""fast-forward"", and ""rewind"" buttons (the sort you see back in the early 2000s). The aircraft itself was an A330 and may be from that era. The upshot was that the seat upholstery was thicker and more comfortable to lean & sit on.

Flight crew were pleasant to deal with. Smiles and sufficiently quick service.

The airport staff and generally the airport in Cairo (not entirely an issue one airline can control) were less pleasant. And for reasons which completely befuddle me, Terminal 3 of Cairo airport has the building exterior (i.e. not the flight boarding phase) security screening done INDOORS of the terminal building, where all the shops & eateries are, before the check-in counters. Since it was indoors and very bright, it was more comfortable. But I can hardly suggest that I felt safer in the knowledge that the security screening, which was supposed to keep out of the terminal building all sorts of dangers, actually happened INSIDE the very terminal building it was meant to keep away from...

I would recommend the airline, but I would strongly suggest flying it without the Cairo airport terminal check-in (i.e. maybe as a transit).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/0b/bc/a7/kat-t.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/719katt,Kat T wrote a review Dec 2018,Kat T,,821 contributions,91 helpful votes,Cairo - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r638640980-EGYPTAIR-World.html,not bad but is arguably expensive for one-way flights,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A cup placed any where other than the cup ring will slid into your lap. We had to struggle to get the attendant to bring extra napkins to clean it up. They had no concern of any physical harm.

"Okay for the price. Staff was correct. Food, a bit average, but not bad. The flight arrived 50 minutes late in Bangkok. Online check-in was not possible in the Netherlands and at Schiphol airport they could only provide me with a boarding pass for the first part of the trip. In Cairo at the transfer desk I obtained the pass for the second part, but with the worst seat possible. So do not assume you get the seat you requested at the initial check-in, but repeat your request.

Biggest drawback was the soundsystem. It was just too loud. I know Egyptians have a different tolerance level for noise, but this was way over the limit. The videos with safety instructions were not just loud, but also interspersed with nerve racking tunes. The sound of the signal when the purser or captain starts talking was incredibly loud.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/24/3c/48/2c/robert-o.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert937,Robert O wrote a review Dec 2018,Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",3406 contributions,6925 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r636824176-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Acceptable,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Egypt Air's business class lounge is small and was crowded at Cairo's International Airport. We had to wait till a couple of passengers vacated their seats but it was no big inconvenience. Service was ok in the lounge. The business class seats inside the aircraft Boeing 777-300 were quite comfortable though no comparison to Qatar or Lufthansa business class for example. Seat controls worked as they should. We were not given menu cards on this return flight - they did on the flight from JFK to Cairo. The breakfast and the afternoon lunch was of decent standard. The food service was enjoyable. This is a dry air line - no alcohol during the flight and the entertainment was mostly in Arabic.

"There aren't many options if flying within Egypt. After reading poor reviews about Nileair - the only other option for direct flights from Cairo to Aswan - I decided to go with Egyptair. Most importantly for us the flight was on time. Check-in and boarding went without any incidences and the staff behaviour was polite enough.

I thought the inflight food could have been better. The small juice pack and cake was tasteless and I couldn't finish the juice even though it was hot weather and I was quite thirsty. I mean, the tickets were not cheap so it's not unfair to expect palatable food on the flight.

The flight crew were friendly and no complains there.

"Flew on MSR 702 Amman to Cairo on November 29 2018. Staff didn't say a word and just gave snobbish faces both when passengers entered/boarded the plane and exited the plane.

A particular staff member, Reem, was racist towards me and my family. My family and I were the only Asian passengers on the plane. She kept shouting for us to hurry up and take a seat, and even asked us to move bags/items for her. We were moving so quickly already, yet she kept fixing her eye on us to find every opportunity to bark at us at times while she was almost on the other end of the plane.

Starting from the very primitive terminal” seasonal Terminal” including it is miserable business lounge!! going through the microbus which is not suitable at all to be serving at airports as we really suffered to get in specially when you have your carry on bags.

I’m requesting Egyptair’s executives to change their mindset of flights from and to Jeddah.

I know you do a lot of money out of Omra and Pilgrims passengers so give them the respect they deserve.
Few things may make the difference :
- Improve the all terminal facilities “ WC, cafeterias, Restaurants ...etc”
- proper transportations tools specially for the business class passengers and please stop these microbuses completely.
- improve the duty free at the arrival and departures.

"There are two parts to my negative review.  On my flight from London to Cairo I unfortunately left a pair of shoes on the plane, besides being expensive they were one of my favourite pairs.  I remembered while still at Cairo airport, I had only just gone through passport control when I wanted to quickly run back and get them off the plane. I was stopped from doing so and told that I would have to travel on to Johannesburg and contact Egyptair in Johannesburg and get the offices at JHB airport to send a telex to Cairo airport to have them sent to me.  Only they failed to tell me that the Egyptair office at JHB airport is NEVER, EVER OPEN.  I've been to the airport seven times during working hours.  The Telephone numbers in South Africa just ring and ring and no-one ever answers them.  I've sent at least 20 emails to every email address on their various websites, and not once have I received a reply to any of them.  Just for reference I once left my duty free purchases on a British Airways flight, and I didn't even remember until the following day, I phoned them, they answered the phone, tracked down the bag and sent it all the way home for me, all within 48 hours - maybe I should just pay the little extra and travel with a decent airline in future.So many will say that I left my shoes on the plane so it was my fault.  However, I did have time to retrieve my shoes in Cairo I'd only just approached the security, additionally I had a 3 hour layover before my next flight so there was no chance I would miss my connection by going back to retrieve my shoes.

"Our 10 and 11 international flights were the best deal economically so accordingly very uncomfortable. No real complaints as we are not high maintenance and chose price over service. This being a direct flight was a plus, no layovers or plane changes.

"Flew with Egyptair on their 737-800 direct service London to Luxor (circa 5.5 hours) and while you couldn't say it was exceptional it was certainly better than many budget and charter carriers. Leg room OK. even in economy (we were lucky and had an emergency exit row on the outbound trip which was even better). It benefits from no alcohol on board, so no rowdy fellow passengers. Meal was OK. Limited at-seat entertainment in economy (overhead screen showing a movie + audio channels) Cabin service OK. Used their iPhone app to check in from our resort and that seemed to work fine. Business class seats looked good.

"All my life i have been flying and this Egypt airline was the worse especially business class so i cant even imagine economy. Seats were extremely old and dirty. My seat and seat pocket was not cleaned after the previous flight so i had other peoples rubbish on my seat and in the seat pocket. Used blanket was given. TV was horrible, coming out of the seat and not stable - falling back, head phones, sound and visual all very bad quality. Food was horrible and i was so hungry so i could only eat the bread, cheese and fruit. When i arrived to Cairo for a stop over at the airport no direction for connections. Finally arrived to the Lounge and guess what! i paid 1.500 GBP to fly business and they put 5 trays of bread and watery humus on the lounge! Bon Apetit! Eat if you can..
On the way back some Chinese passengers were coughing and air hostess (the one with pretty face dark hair) would look at this passengers and do an expression of disgussed face- which i've found it horrible to watch her doing that. She was behaving aggresive towards with Chinese clients and when her colleagues are polite with clients she was getting angry with her colleagues and telling them to be rude and get the work done.

And how dirty is the remote control of the TV with red oily sauce on it! And only sugary drinks and cola! no alcohol. I had to take a shower and disinfect myself after the plane imagine!
Over all Egypt airline either needs to stop this flights or get some new ones and improve their food quality and services. In Which airline you still can not turn the seat to flat bed!

"We flew to Cairo from Mumbai in November 2018. We chose Egypt Air as it was the only option to fly direct. The services were best not described. For the first time I saw that there were no alcoholic drinks served on an international flight. The aircraft was A330-200, with no TVs. The staff was quite indifferent. Food was nothing worth mentioning.

We also had a couple of domestic flights in Egypt, on EgyptAir. Those services were far better.

Our return flight from Cairo to Mumbai was slightly better, on an A330-300 which had TVs. Food was ok. The drinks were not there yet again.

"Egyptair used to be way better.

Cons

1) Lack of maintenance: The chair in front of me was broken, the earphone plug didn't work at all and my table was half broken. In addition to that, we experienced a technical failure after approximately 30 minutes after takeoff and we were taken back to Cairo airport( this cause approximately 2 hours of delay). All the above-mentioned issues clearly show that there is a lack of maintenance.

2) Unprofessional and grumpy cabin crew: most of the cabin crew seemed very upset and there weren't helpful at all. A lady that was sitting across of me got her seat belt stuck in between the chairs. When she asked one of the stewards to help her solve the problem he tried to help her for few seconds and then responded saying that it wasn't working anymore and he left. The Stewart didn't do anything to solve the problem nor did he care about the woman's safety.

3) Food wasn't fresh at all. After eating the food that I was offered ( rise and meat ) I got food poisoning and got sick for two days.

4) There was a smell of smoke that worried me a lot.

Pros

Egyptair is one of the few airline companies that allows a great deal of baggage allowance.

Check-in was very smooth and the people who checked me in were very efficient and very professional.

It is well connected and it goes to plenty of countries.

"Flying anything these days that's short of business class (excluding Emirates), can be trying. My experience with most US and Canadian carriers is they're ""service"" is very, very, average when it comes to economy, and that's being kind. Flight attendants on North American flights now tend to be overly officious and not particularly friendly, due in large part to 911 no doubt. However, the Egyptair folks by contrast are far more relaxed and easy going than most other American and European carriers. Their service is proficient enough and friendly, the food is not fantastic, but it is palatable, and they're pretty relaxed about letting people get up to wander about and stretch their legs (I'm sure the lack of booze on the plane probably helps with this).The planes are not the newest, but they're not the oldest fleet I've flown either. In the end, I'd describe my experience as just a bit above the North American carriers - so 3 1/2 stars, not 3.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity30548077460,Curiosity30548077460 wrote a review Nov 2018,Curiosity30548077460,"Bracebridge, Canada",2 contributions,3 helpful votes,Toronto - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r632404762-EGYPTAIR-World.html,A Bit Above Average...,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Be aware that no alcohol is served on Egyptair.
No relaxing cocktails.
No wine with dinner.
No drink to help you sleep.

Other than a nice, tender, small piece of steak with dinner, the food was well below Business Class standards.
Breakfast included a dish of dark brown glop called ""fool"". I think that I was the fool for trying it. Made from ground up beans ( I think) it looked like something I would avoid while walking my dog. I covered it in honey to give it a flavor.
The other food was uninspired and not fresh looking. Definitely below Business Class standards.

The movies and videos were old and bland. The only recent movie was ""The Meg"". All violent special effects and zero plot. Sleeping was more entertaining.

"Check in at Heathrow was good,the boarding process at the gate was poor could not hear P.A. so was a bit of a scrum.Once on board the plane was fine plenty of leg room,good entertainment system,average plane food,no alcohol served on Egypt air flights.Had to change planes in Cairo and had 1 hour 45 minutes to play with which in most airports would be plenty,but Cairo airport is total chaos,after buying my visa from the bank found the queue for the domestic terminal and there was about 100 people in the queue and only one officer on the desk.As the departure time for both the Sharm and Hurghada flights came nearer people were getting very fractious and verbal,eventually some Egypt air staff turned up and said they would hold the flights as they were the last flights of the day.Eventually got through and boarded and the flight left 35 minutes late with many stressed people on.The flight was fine but badly tainted by the airport experience.Wont travel this way again rather pay more for Turkish airlines and go via Istanbul.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/d1/17/a8/scubacol11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubacol11,scubacol11 wrote a review Nov 2018,scubacol11,"Rotherham, United Kingdom",1907 contributions,755 helpful votes,London - Sharm El Sheikh,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r630150048-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Good flights,Cairo airport chaos.",Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight was on 24th of October ms 307 from Cairo to sharm . We were 3 passengers 2 of them are British citizens and they had booked with Egypt air over 6 flight in 12 days .imagine how much they paid for these flights . We arrived to the airport 40 minutes before the flight and the officer at the gate said you still have time and we went to check in desk and we found a lady ( Mona so menoufy) looks angry and tired and ignored us . Didn't even look at us and when we asked her to check us in she only said you late however they were stil didn't call for final call to the flight. We asked her to talk to someone in charge to could help us but she said no. We spent 35 mintus just arguing to find some to help until we found lady came at 1345 says sorry the flight just left . How come while we were baging then to let us check in 35 minutes before take off.

We wrote complaint and changed the tickets again but until this moment no one even to emsil us or call us..

Really it's the worst airline I ever flu with..staff are rude. Have zero information about customer service. Hot helpful at all.will never fly with Egypt air again.

"It always helps to have little to no expectation when flying a carrier not really known for much except the fact it’s Egypt’s flag carrier.

My Egyptian holiday began in Sharm el Sheikh. The town is very seasonal so the only two international carriers that fly year-round are both EgyptAir and Turkish Airlines.

All EgyptAir flights operate out of Cairo’s Terminal 3. Note there are two security processes: one before entering the ticketing area and another before your gate. For the former, present your passport and flight details (I had mine on my phone and the guards had no problem with it).

Once past, I made my way to the ticket counters. There was a queue, but it moved swiftly. They checked my bag in because it weighed more than 8 kg (the bag was free anyways).

Once I had ticket in hand, I made my way to the domestic area. Note the domestic and international departure areas are split. To say the domestic zone is barren is an understatement. There’s one coffee place and an Egyptair Lounge. If you arrive early, prepare to not do much.

My flight to Sharm was operated by Egyptair Express. As such, we had to take a bus to a remote terminal. There was no rhyme or reason for boarding: everyone just boarded the bus and the aircraft.

Pitch is average, but tight if you’re taller than 5’7”. The flight attendants professional if not stoic. Announcements were made in both Arabic and English.

After doors closed, we taxied for about 15 minutes before taking off. For a short flight, I was surprised they served a snack (my flight was prepackaged butter cookies).

As soon as the FAs made their rounds, we began our descent.

I paid USD$117 one way. For a short flight, Egyptair is totally serviceable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/1c/89/1c/louie-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_glbetrkkr_,_glbetrkkr_ wrote a review Oct 2018,_glbetrkkr_,"New York City, New York",1268 contributions,339 helpful votes,Cairo - Sharm El Sheikh,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r628976469-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Zero Expectation,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our travel company had booked us into Business Class - don’t bother. Travel economy - same seats and same service.

Upon our check-in at Aswan to go to Abu Simbel we received 3 boarding passes. The first for the flight from Aswan to Abu Simbel, the second from Abu Simbel to Aswan and the third the ongoing flight from Aswan to Cairo (same Flight No. but different seats).

We had checked our large luggage in on the flight to Abu Simbel and were told that it would be kept at Aswan until the plane returned and then would be loaded for us to pick up in Cairo - thankfully this process worked well and we gratefully picked our bags off the carousel in Cairo airport.

Shambles at Abu Simbel airport - huge queue out the door trying to get through security screening which was not helped by some very uncooperative travellers who waited until they got to the X-ray machines before rustling in their pockets etc to see what they had.

When we finally got inside the terminal the green light for “boarding” was flashing for our flight but as we got up to the next security screening, at the one and only boarding gate, we were told our flight was not boarding yet as they were still boarding the previous flight. No priority boarding.

Finally boarded (bus out to the parking bay on the tarmac) and received our fruit juice from the same stewardess who was on the same aircraft, the Embraer 170, that we had caught from Aswan to Abu Simbel some 3/4 hours earlier. It had been from Abu Simbel, via Aswan to Cairo and return whilst we had been touring the magnificent temples at Abu Simbel. The stewardess said they had already done 5 sectors that day.

Same shortened safety briefing - seat belts, exits and safety card at front of plane if you want to receive more. No announcements from the pilots as we took off over 40 minutes late for our short 35 minute flight to Aswan. Good flight and nice landing.

Some confusion then as to whether we were to get off or stay on the plane. Eventually advised that we should stay on the plane but sit in our new seats which were also in Business Class. The Business Class section on the flight from Abu Simbel to Aswan had been restricted to the first 2 rows but whilst on the ground at Aswan the dividing curtain was quickly moved back an additional 6 rows and presto! An extended Business Class section but the same seats. A ground crew member then checked our boarding passes whilst we were on the plane and shortly thereafter the new passengers joined us. We ended up taking off from Aswan only about 5 minutes late.

New safety briefing - seat belts, exits and this time oxygen masks plus the safety cards.

New carton of juice. Still no pilot announcements either then or on the approximately one and a half hour flight to Cairo. We did though receive a small tray with 2 small open sandwiches (one meat and one cheese), 3 pieces of cake, 2 olives, water and coffee/tea during the flight.

Smooth flight and smooth landing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/da/93/e5/westy54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westy54,westy54 wrote a review Oct 2018,westy54,"Sydney, Australia",8104 contributions,1111 helpful votes,Abu Simbel - Cairo,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r628932923-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Egyptair Express Business Class Abu Simbel to Cairo via Aswan.

Security screening at Aswan incredibly slow such that all flights were delayed. Bus from the gate to the plane in the parking bay on the tarmac. Packet of fruit juice to everyone on boarding.

No announcements by pilot re flying time etc. Safety briefing limited to seat belts and exits and consult safety cards kept at the front of the plane for the rest.

"My wife and I flew r/t Biz class from JFK to Cairo, plus 4 domestic flights within Egypt.  We had read some reviews beforehand and were prepared to endure whatever, especially since earlier this year we had flown Biz on a 787-9 r/t LAX to Sydney with American.   Were we ever surprised!  Egyptair's Triple-7 was a little tired looking and cannot compare to the new 787's, but neither could the service.  ALL the flight attendants on ALL our Egyptair flights could not have been more friendly, attentive, and efficient.  We have flown international not only on American, but Asiana, LAN, and United.  I would choose the service we received from Egyptair's crews over any of these.  Perhaps not the services available, but certainly for the staff.

"so i have flown them before but i see now they using a better aircraft than before, airbus A330-300 and all has screens on the seats, in flight wifi, chat and calling capability from seat to seat, so well done on that, Cabin crew on the flight from jhb to cairo and Cairo to jhb as well very friendly and great, on the flights from Cairo to Saudi Arabia and return i was not so happy, small planes not enough hand luggage space, people fighting all the time and the one thing i was not so happy with was the fact that when they serve food only juice boxes are give and only the flavours they have, so not everyone likes those and not everyone drinks Juice, i feel some Coke, sprite etc should be catered for as well as Diet drinks for Diabetics etc.
overall doing better, Cairo Airport also better than before and the transit passengers over 6 hours get Hotel accommodation as well as meals depending on the time of the day which is always a + coz you get to go out and sleep and you have long hours, you can also go see the pyramids etc

So all in all was good I would use them again, i would possibly look at business class for short flights tho coz of space :>

"Egypt air operates a monopoly from Hurghada to Cairo so am not sure you would be able to avoid it. The check in staff and security were pleasant but as soon as I got on the plan I started taking notes of the service. There was no greeting from flight attendants. They literally ignored the people getting on the plane. Basically, they weren't at the entrance of the plane. None of the attendants smiled throughout the journey. My seatbelts weren't checked. I did not hear safety information in English. I wasn't asked to stowe away my table whilst I was writing my notes on the service, even though we were advancing onto the runway.

"Not sure why they have first class on these smaller regional jets. They just move the curtain back and there is no one in the middle seat. That was about it, the legroom was non existent; which for an hour flight i was OK with the lack of room. The plane needed a little TLC... the knob for the vents broke off in my hand and my tray table was not attached to the seat in front of me. I had to rest the tray table on my legs.

"My original connecting flight with Air France was cancelled and they booked me on a flight with EgyptAir and I can say I was very disappointed. I had paid for a premium offering through AF and this flight only had economy and business class but was pretty much all booked. I was given a seat in row 33 but not an aisle or window as I always pay for. I was told repeatedly to wait to the gate opened and they would fix my arrangement. I was even directed to the EgyptAir desk at CDG (which meant I had to ""leave"" the airport and then be subjected to 45min of wait time to re-enter). The flight had been sold out as passenger from mine and another cancelled flight scrabbled to reach their destination. The flight boarded late and was full of screaming children and newborn babies, making it the worst flight of my life. The family of children behind me kept repeatedly kicking my seat and the 3month old baby cried the entire 4hr flight. Somehow I was one of the last people to be serve a meal and I received something that looked like vomit and vegetables. They said it was chicken but my vegetarian companion(who had been finished eating for over 30 min because they were served right away) said it looked and smelled of beef. Which if that was the case, I did not eat, would have been a disaster for someone who doesn't eat red meat or has food restrictions. My luggage was late and throughout the flight I was constantly being jostled. This flight is an example of what is wrong with the airline industry.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/7d/bd/b2/amtj2008.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amtj2008,amtj2008 wrote a review Oct 2018,amtj2008,"Chicago, Illinois",77 contributions,43 helpful votes,Paris - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r625756637-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Cattle Airline,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good service once again on Egyptair from Cairo to London.
Flight left on time and arrived on time. Seats reasonably comfortable in Economy - I had an over-wing window seat. Good in-flight meal and entertainment facilities (not that I use the latter much). Friendly staff and good value for money.

Helpful tip: Cairo airport terminal could be a wee bit better. They have a final round of hand luggage security at the departure gate - so even if you have bought water in the terminal you will have to jettison this before boarding unless you have bought it in the DUTY FREE outlets (not the food hall outlets) and have kept the receipt.

"With regular travel it is easy to get stuck in always booking with the 'regular' airlines. This was the case with a recent business trip to Egypt.

The 'regular' airlines would take me from South Africa, via Europe, to Egypt. Although not a bad routing, the option was there to take Egyptair, for a more direct routing, and a business class ticket for a similar price to the economy on the other routing.

I took the Egyptair option, as so many other holiday travellers do, and I was pleasantly surprised.

From check-in to good-byes, everyone had friendly smiles.

"Tour group we booked with organised business class seating. Would not bother on this short flight of just on an hour.

There was no separate business class queue for the first security check and x-ray of bags, which is before you even get to the Check-in/bagdrop. Once through this there was a separate business checkin/bagdrop - one of the few priveleges afforded.

Business class gave entry to the domestic Egytair lounge - don’t bother. 26 lounge chairs jammed into a tiny room with a few pastries, hot water for tea and coffee and a minbar fridge with water and soft drinks. They don’t call flights. Much more room outside in the general terminal.

Went to the gate and an additional security checkpoint for carry-on. There were signs for a separate business classs queue but the x-ray machine for this queue was not being operated. Once through into the boarding area we waited for the call for who boarded first. No such call. They opened the door to the gangplank entry area and it was a free for all.

Boeing 737/800, but obviously an older model as there were ashtrays in the seat arms.

On board service consisted of a popper of guava or apple and a pack of about 6 sweet biscuits.

Only other benefit was a separate bus just for the business class passengers from the tarmac to the terminal. Didn’t matter as bags then took over 30 minutes to come through to the carousel.

Not worth the money for such a short flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/da/93/e5/westy54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westy54,westy54 wrote a review Oct 2018,westy54,"Sydney, Australia",8104 contributions,1111 helpful votes,Cairo - Luxor,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r625042765-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Very average business class service on domestic flight.,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had 2 reservations with EgyptAir on 26.08.2017 from BOM to YYZ having PNR as RAC6OQ & RAYM3G. to be frank it was unpleasant flight and your staff behavior was very rude and i felt that we were being discriminated every time at all point of contacts. talking about our first connections Mumbai - Cairo

1) Flight was delayed by more than 1.45 hours. At check-in counters i was told that refreshment is provided at the gate and there was no one to even guide at which cafe the same is available? we are not god to know everything. had to wait for your staff to let us know where the cafe is.

2) Your staff at the check-in gate always used local arabic language which was discriminating as we could hardly understand anything. and after boarding the flight below is the experience

3) we were not provided blankets for our seats and all other seats had blankets with them. when requested the staff bluntly said we dont have it, you have to adjust it. i was like why should i adjust you are responsible to provide blankets to all passengers. Airline had the information before hand that how many passengers are travelling with them they should have made the arrangements before hand to avoid any inconvenience to fellow passengers. what amazed me was only Indian national passengers were not given blankets, other nationalities had the blanket. One of the passenger was travelling on student visa and the staff didn't even bothered to wake up the passenger for meal or breakfast. what kind of service is this??

4) after we landed at Cairo we had to nearly wait for 30 mins for a passenger bus to arrive to take us to the terminal building. its your main hub and the airline is expected to be prepared for all the incoming & outgoing flights. again your staff was least bothered to handle passengers.

5) we were told that we will be provided transit visa so that we can take day tour nevertheless it was so time consuming that at one point of time I decided not to go anywhere and just stay at airport. You are doing a good job of providing free transit visa but at the same time you are not doing any extra ordinary favors as passengers travelling in transit are also contributing to tourism revenues.

6) Hotel was not even prepared to handle transit passengers. we were not even picked up on time from the airport. after reaching hotel the room took almost 1.30 hours to handover the room keys and cited reasons like its not ready as yet.

7) now coming to more serious issues, i was not provided food for my flight from CAI-YYZ?? can you imagine? how racist can you be? and till what extent you can go to harass passengers?? i was told to eat non vegetarian meal just because they didnt had the veg meal available?? what non sense you are talking? they said because you didnt book the veg meal online we dont have it with us. While i did for one of my booking i was not able to do it for other booking as your site didnt process it. i was just not given any option neither to crew tried to make any arrangements so that they can help me have food. this is ridiculous of all. what if passengers dont have access to internet and cannot book the veg meal? you will not provide them meal at all?? its the responsibility of the airline to provide meals as per passengers request. now i got one meal which was only boiled spaghetti, boiled aubergine, boiled carrots without any taste or even a salt. this is seriously hurting bad now. i simply gave back the only veg meal given to us between 2 passengers saying i cant eat this food. when i asked the serving staff for a drink he is like my colleague will help you. Racist, simply discriminating us as we were Indians.

8) now coming to breakfast again we were given only one veg meal, again it was the same meal that was given last night? what do you expect us to do now? for a flight lasting more than 11 hours you want us to stay hungry?? height of inefficiency of your staff. we stayed on 2 bread pieces and 2 pc of cake for the whole flight and had to stay on soft drinks such as coke, water and juices. I wouldnt be staying on just drinks for the whole flight.

9) i had to go through 3 security checks at Cairo airport, what for?? being a permanent resident of Canada I was asked for my COPR copy, my visa stamp, i asked on what ground you are asking for this documents? you are not canadian authorities to ask such documents and i have already cleared immigration at Mumbai airport before i could board the outbound flight to Cairo. why harass us again as were merely transit passengers. a student with us was held for documents like student permit, proof of college admission, and what not? please understand you are merely an airline not a immigration office to request all such documents. we already had a valid visa to travel to the country of destination. despite having a valid visa we were being asked such documents which at first place are irrelevant on your part and your staff is least trained on to handle these issues.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller_ankleshwar,Heman S wrote a review Oct 2018,Heman S,"Regina, Canada",2 contributions,7 helpful votes,Cairo - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r624335721-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst airline to travel with,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I travel a lot and EGYPTAIR has unfortunately become one of the worst airlines that I travel with. This has not always been the case but over the past years it keeps on deteriorating. You get the impression that they simply do not care to provide a good service. There is also zero accountability. Delays? Always someone else’s fault. Problems with the food?

"I just returned from a flight to Cairo with Egyptair.  I actually flew to Cairo, then to Luxor and return, then return to Toronto all with Egyptair.  The flights were all excellent.

When i got to Egypt the flight was delayed for over 2 hours with no apology. A meal was served on the flight but i didn't eat it as it didn't look good at all.

The flight felt more like flying in a low cost domestic carrier rather than an international flight.

There had been no option to select the cuisine of food at the time of booking or while checking in online but the crew kept insisting that vegetarian food is available only if pre ordered.

"A great flight for the price. Two free bags and no one quibbled for a second when my first bag was 5kg over. The seats had a bit more room than other economy long hauls and had that lay back where the bottom slides forward that I think is a much better idea.
There wasn't a great selection of movies, but I had been flying a lot recently, so it was probably just because I'd seen them all.
The food was not fabulous, but no worse than any other and INCLUDED. They also gave you a blanket, pillow, and little kit with headphones and eye mask, etc.
People were very friendly and most everything went just like it always goes with every airline.
The only complaint I could register was that there was no alcohol served on this airline (?), certainly this flight. Not the worst thing in the world.
Also, I waited almost 2 hours for my bags to arrive on the carousel. I am not sure if that's the fault of Egyptair, JFK, or US customs, though.

"Travelled to Luxor from Cairo on 24/09/2018 in a party of ten.
The aircraft was unfamiliar but probably based on a 727.
Seating was pretty good with more legroom than your average UK or European based airlines. No alcohol is served on any Egyptair flight, international or internal, but there is a good range of soft drinks, tea or coffee.

5 of our party had bags not show up at Luxor, plus another 6 bags from other PAX.
Rather strangely, nearly all the bags that went astray were from couples, one bag per couple not being loaded at the Cairo end.
I am informed that this happens on a regular basis and the reason is usually to make room for freight, so I was told from a reliable source.
All the bags turned up a few hours later, but the delay caused at Luxor meant our group and a couple of other people travelling to the same destination missed our dinner and a reception on board the boat we were staying on for a cruise.

"This is my second review of Egyptair.  We traveled to Cairo from JFK that's on another review.  This is for our Aswan to Cairo flight. We arrived at the Aswan airport along with 18 other travelers on a tour heading back to Cairo.  We were all booked on this flight by our tour guide company and had printed confirmations and had confirmed our flights.  My wife and I were denied a boarding pass as the flight was overbooked. While our fellow travelers proceeded to the gate we stood at the ticket counter for over 45 minutes while the Egyptair agent kept entering information into his computer trying to figure something out.  Finally he gave us the bad news that we will not be leaving at 7pm with our fellow travelers but would be on the 10pm flight.  He also said we would get a voucher for $30 each for our troubles.  In addition we could have a slice of pizza and a ""coke"" on Egyptair.  Aswan airport has very limited food choices. While waiting at the ticket counter  I asked the agent if anyone who was ticketed for our flight was asked to get bumped for compensation like you see at most airports.  He assured us they asked but no one wanted to take the bump.  We took our tickets and voucher met up with our fellow passengers who had not yet boarded the 7pm flight.  We asked if the airlines had asked anyone waiting for the flight if they would take a bump for compensation and they said no one from Egyptair had made any such offers.  The next day as we arrived at the Cairo airport to fly back to JFK we tried to cash in our $30 vouchers.  No one was able to do that at the Egyptair desks.  Since then we have contacted wecareEgyptair asking for more than the $30 offered.  We sent copies of our vouchers but at this point nothing has been resolved.

"This was the 5th flight with Egyptair. The check in was super flawless in fact they gave us our seating assignments for the next leg from Cairo to JFK at the same time. We were really worried about the overweight issues with our bags but they did not worry about a few pounds over weight. Again the service on board was great.
The only issues we ever had with flying around Egypt was with security checks getting into the airport etc. Seems like they are all thinking up their own ideas about what can go through and what can't. A lot of people go there to dive and a lot of the security personnel don't have a clue about basic scuba gear such as regulators, safety sausages etc. Someone needs to educate them and stop the stupid checks. This is probably the number one thing that most of our group (23) experienced throughout our 23 day trip. Traveling on five different flights with Egyptair some people had stuff taken away that made absolutely no sense. One had dive reel taken away because they said they could hang someone with it yet the 10 lb. laptop could not kill someone by beating them over the head.

"Used this airline to visit Egypt (JFK-Cairo-Aswan-Cairo) and were very happy with the services and schedule respect. Inflight services are excellent with very tasty meals. Aircraft between JFK-Cairo-JFK was Boeing 777-300 with decent pitch for your legs and for local flights, they used B 737-300 with acceptable inflight comfort.

Quite surprising fact that after 35 years of travelling, a flight attendant asked me how I was doing and did I need anything else. Hoping that all Star Alliance Members will achieve this kind of customer care!

All my respect and admiration

"We travelled with Egyptair on a flight to juba via Cairo. Usually we travel
With Ethiopian airlines via Addis to juba
On arrival at Cairo at 20:40 we had a 7.5hr stop over 04:00 and at booking in London were toldcwe’d ve given a hotel room.
We arrived and were directed through security to second floor after some time in not finding desk we were eventually redirected back down to arrivals. After another lot of misdirections we were told that we were now too late to claim our room. As a result we spent the night in a cafe as lounge which we offered to pay $30 for was full!

"I had the most amazing flights with Egyptair. After reading reviews, I was hesitant to fly with Egyptair, but I am glad i did not listen. The flight was only half full, so i got my own row in economy. The flight attendants were all incredibly kind and helpful. Even if the flight was full, it would still be an enjoyable one. The food was good for airline food. The flight took off and landed on time. Some people complain that the planes are a little older, but older planes provide more seat cushion and leg space. With that being said, I did notice some wobbly tray tables, but nothing horrible. The entertainment was lacking a bit (as compared to other star alliance airlines), so be sure to bring your own. Or you could be open to watching some arabic movies with subtitles (many of them are wonderful). I also took several local flights around the country and i'm not sure how one can complain about a 1 hour flight. It was over by the time my cup of tea was finished. All in all, Egypt air provided me with some of the best flight experiences i have had in a long time!

"So, there were two delays out of the Cairo airport due to mechanical problems. The good side is that the airline put safety before scheduled flight time. The bad side is that we missed our connecting flight home and the ground representative was of absolutely no help. Hence the ""average"" rating.

In Munich, it was Lufthansa that handled our stay-over, and this was well handled. But Egyptair even failed to provide us with the necessary information to get to the Lufthansa desk.

"Seat width and leg room was adequate (but could always be larger).  We selected our seats months ahead of time on their website, and selected a special meal.  We did not get the seats we selected OR our special meals.  Other than that, everything went smoothly on the way TO Cairo from JFK.  They do not have an Economy Plus cabin, which is the class we typically prefer to fly in, so it was a little tighter than we are used to.  The flight attendants came regularly with drinks to keep us hydrated, and the food was actually pretty decent (for airline food).  In-Seat Entertainment was sub-par.  There were very few American movies from which to choose, and while I didn't mind, they were all severely edited for content (swear words, drinking, sexual content, etc...)  The ISE was also very difficult to work and glitchy.  There was a USB charging port on the headrest, which was very nice. They provided a little care packet including headphones, socks, eye mask, ear plugs, toothbrush and toothpaste. I'm actually glad for this tidbit, but most Americans will not be... there is absolutely no alcohol on board.  The bathrooms were a disaster the entire flight.  Completely disgusting.  Overall, it was 10.5 hours of flying, but it was doable and uneventful.  On the way back from Cairo to JFK, I felt like we were flying a different airline!  It was pretty rough.  Again, we had selected our seats, which we did not get, and selected our meals, which we did not get.  We were told it was a completely full flight and we could not move.  However, that was not the case.  There were plenty of open seats and others were allowed to move seats.  But we were good and stayed put.  Food was not as good this time around & was somewhat unrecognizable.  Flight attendants stayed in a group in the far back of the plane the entire flight and did not come around with beverages to keep us hydrated.  If you walked the length of the plane to the back to get a drink, they acted like you were bothering them, and they only gave you 2 sips of water in a tiny cup, not enough to even wet my mouth, let alone quench my thirst.  We were painfully dehydrated by the time we landed. Add the cacophony of crying babies, and coughing and sneezing passengers, and we were extremely bedraggled by the time we reached JFK.  I was disappointed in the lack of service on the flight home.  We got there and back safely and inexpensively, and relatively quickly, and we got to see Egypt in between, so it wasn't all bad!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyssakathrynb,Alyssa Kathryn B wrote a review Sep 2018,Alyssa Kathryn B,"Broomall, Pennsylvania",208 contributions,20 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r619537741-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Roundtrip from JFK to Cairo on Egyptair,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Took several Egypt Air flights during this trip (Cairo to Aswan, Aswan to Abu Simbel and back, Luxor to Cairo and Cairo to London).  Our flights were nice - they did give our a pack of sugar cookies instead of the peanuts or pretzels you get on other airlines.  I had booked our flight from Luxor to Cairo and Cairo to London on separate tickets to save money (about $1,100 when flying to the US).  The gentleman at the check-in was a bit disgruntled and asked us to take a seat while he figured it out, but once the long line behind us was gone, but he ended up being able to check our bags all the way through to our final destination, and came and found us at the gate in order to give us the rest of our boarding passes.  Our flight from Luxor was delayed by about 90 minutes, so we only had about 20 minutes to make our flight in Cairo.  When we got off the plane in Cairo, we started running to the passport control (transfer desk) and someone from Egypt Air met us half way and asked us if we were going to London.  He helped us jump the lines at security and passport control and made sure that we did not miss our flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/584emilyl,Emily H wrote a review Sep 2018,Emily H,"Cincinnati, Ohio",104 contributions,91 helpful votes,Cairo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r618908556-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Great Customer Service,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"our flight was late leaving anyway but it was a 5.5 hour flight. This was a very small plane a 737. The seats were very cramped, close together with hardly any room between the back of the seat in front and my seat. You had to be a contortionist to be able to eat your food from the tray table without spilling the food or elbowing the person in the next seat. Our tv screen that was 3 seats ahead, was almost black for most of the film and I noticed that others on the other side of the plane were similar. We could see in the distance that a screen further down looked brighter. We were only offered a hot drink with the meal and then only once. Most flights offer a 2nd cup. The food was typical airline food so nothing to report there. We were given blankets and a pillow at no cost, which was good. It was needed as the plane was very cold. The staff only came once to collect rubbish so missed mine which ended up in the seat pocket. The light in the toilet was very dim. The sink was grimey and dirty, not just soapy.

"Unfortunately Egypt Air have a monopoly on flights to Luxor (via Cairo) and they are very expensive. They're not too worried about the usual rules of air travel.   Seat belts,  seat backs etc are sometimes not checked.   Many Egyptians seem to think that they can sit anywhere.  Several groups of passengers did this on the outward journey and didn't want to sit in their allocated seats.  We missed our slot and therefore nearly missed our onward flight to Luxor.

"Flew Egyptair from JFK to Cairo as part of a group tour to Egypt. Also flew this airline 3 years ago on a previous tour to Egypt and it was not the best but better than expected. This time it was terrible. No rules enforced or selectively enforced. We were in row 42 an exit row. We had to stow our bags in the overhead for take off and landing which is normal but the Egyptian woman sitting next to me didn't have to. She was asked once to stow her huge tote but never did and flight attendants just looked at her and the bag and never enforced the rule. This was for both taking off and landing. Same with others around us. No enforcing seats in upright position for take off and landing. Food was pretty bad- no in flight water service- you had to walk to the back and get it yourself. When landing, several dozen people jumped up and opened overhead bins as soon as we touched down and was still moving. Others got up and ran to toilets. Children running up and down aisles all during the flight. Screaming babies everywhere.  Flight attendants didn't do anything to enforce anything and could care less - no personality either- movie and game selection was terrible. I have flown to 140 countries and travel all over the world and this airline ranks in the top 2 or 3 worst I've ever been on. The flight from JFK to Cairo was bad and the return from Cairo to JFK was even worse with more of the same violations and lack of caring and service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieG_8,LeslieG_8 wrote a review Sep 2018,LeslieG_8,Tennessee,270 contributions,105 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r617550161-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not Good,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am a frequent international traveler.  Have flown all over the world with various large and small carriers.  The unprofessionalism of the flight crew, from the female flight attendant to her male cabin chief for flight #747 from Cairo to Athens on 9/15 was reprehensible.  The incident occurred when an unruly male passenger, seat 21H, in front continued to recline and bounces his seat backwards denying any room for my tray to be down for meal service and injuring my knees. When I sought help after not being able to eat, nor have my iPad open without it being abruptly slammed upon, I received no help, but was first ridiculed by the female flight attendant when I asked her to ask the passenger to put his seat upright so I can put my tray down to eat.  She told me that I should only eat when that passenger signals me when he is ready and that to not try and eat or use my iPad. She then joked in her language with two passengers next to me and they started laughing and thought my plea for her help was funny.  Soon after she left, passenger 21H, bounced back even more and reclined further, digging the bottom of his seat and hitting my knees and popped my iPad out of its standing case.  He then had the audacity to yell at me and said I was digging my knee in his back. I called for help and the cabin chief  took a while to come. While waiting for help, apparently, in the back of the airplane there was an assault between two female passengers and I heard the cabin chief refusing to help the victim press charges or take control of the situation.  When he reached me, I explained the problem, even showed him how my knees were injured and still had dents/bruising, passengers across my seat even spoke to be witness to the facts; he told me that I was not injured and that passenger 21H had a right to assault me with his need to fully recline his seat while I have no right to even have any space in front of me to eat my meal, put my tray down, and open my iPad.  He then spoke to 21H, laughed about the situation, and told him that I was going to make trouble for him since I asked for his name and am filing a file a complaint and that he better back him up when the complaint surfaces.  The cabin chief never once asked passenger 21H to bring his seat up or try to remedy or mediate, but instead, being the male chauvinist he was and his entire racist crew was, dismissed my injures and simply denied me my basic right as a passenger.  I would caution anyone to fly with this carrier given that especially as a female, non Egyptian or Arabic speaking passenger; you may not receive any help and be subjected to ridicule and merely be dismissed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinalL788NW,tml wrote a review Sep 2018,tml,"San Francisco, California",13 contributions,8 helpful votes,Cairo - Athens,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r617000479-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Worst Flight Crew- Male Chauvinism at its finest!,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The funniest thing or the most ridiculous excuse i heard. I received three SMS to check in online for three various flights on EgyptAir. I did and I was happy because for the first time the web checkin somehow works using the link sent to me.

Then of course EgyptAir management and team have to surprise me as usual. It’s a domestic flight and I arrived at the final gate waiting for the bus and I showed the ground employee my phone with e-boarding pass then he asked for my passport , so I handed it over to him and he kept me aside from the line while he is printing all the boarding passes for the three flights. I asked is the e-boarding no good? He started mumbling with the most ridiculous excuses that I have never heard. Which is because we have other works in the backgrounds and I have to detach the boarding pass into two. RUBBISH talk.

Why on earth are you wasting my time to check in online if your employees don’t accept it????? Then you waste my time at the gate ?????? This is certainly a top management major issues that they are sleeping home while the employees are doing whatever they think is right.

Why on earth you have no value for people minds. Even if you want to give an excuse, train those bodies standing at the gates to say sense.

"Me and my wife took Egypt Air flight from Mumbai to Toronto via Cairo (MS 969 & MS 995). We had a long layover at Cairo (20 hours).
The check-in counter at Mumbai airport opened almost 5 hours before. They will give you paper luggage tags for check-in luggage. They didn't charge us for 5 extra kgs of check-in luggage.
The boarding was almost 15 minutes before scheduled departure. Ensure you board early since space for overhead luggage space is limited and almost everyone carries a trolley bag. People who boarded last didn't have any space to stow their had luggage.
The Mumbai Cairo flight was a horrible experience. People were still looking for space for their hand luggage and the flight took off. Crew members were rude and didn't care. Aircraft was old and some seats didn't recline. Food wasn't that great.
After landing in Cairo (6 hour flight), at ARRIVALS we went to a counter called ""Transfer Customer Accomodation Service"". We were given a free transit stay and transit visa. Stay was arranged at Hilton with all meals included. Passports were kept by the Egypt Air officials but they give you a receipt. You get your passport once you produce the receipt at the Departures. Totally safe.
An official also arranged for Pyramids tour for 50 CAD or 40 USD (rates vary depending on group size)(USD, CAD and Egyptian currency accepted only and in cash). It includes AC coach and guide. Tour lasts for 4-5 hours. Ensure you take a receipt and contact details of the tour operator.
We were taken to Hilton and checked in. Had our Breakfast, took a shower and waited at lobby for the coach driver to arrive. Take water, umbrella and sunscreen when you go. The guide will show you Nile river, 3 Pyramids, the spinx, perfume shop and Papyrus Photo shop. You may enter the inside of Pyramids but at an extra cost. Tickets to be purchased at the entrance in Egyptian currency and in cash.
We returned back to hotel, had lunch, slept, got ready, had dinner and went to airport. At airport, we went to Egypt Air counter to get our passports and Boarding Passes back on producing the receipt.
Cairo-Toronto flight was much better. Service was great, no hand baggage problem.
Food was still a concern.

Overall it was a great experience. Cairo stay and Pyramid visit was great.

3 and a half hour charter flight with a bit unenthusiastic crew. The fight in had good food surprisingly because when boarding we had a shock seeing the interior of the plane -  very dated and feel almost dirty look.

"I’ve been flying with Egypt air for few years lately at least twice a year! Today I flew from Cairo to Toronto (this is at least a trip I make once a year)! The flight was great! I was extremely happy with the service! There were beuitiful pleasant flight attendants! Very helpful, smiling all the time and always tying to go the extra mile with passengers! Although the flight was delayed leaving Cairo (out of control reasons- delays at passport control), the smile on the employees faces made it okay for us.
I’m pretty sure Egypt air have finally changed their catering company. The food looked different and had different options for main meals! Washrooms were periodacly cleaned!
I wish took a note of the flight attendants who were looking after our seats to thank them in person and to write down their names here!
A big THANK YOU to all of you!

Little choice of airlines to Cairo (and onward to Sharm el Sheikh). Make sure you do online check in....the airline is known for overbooking. Pre-seated on booking confirmation (a big plus). Free plastic wrapping at Egyptair counters in Terminal B in Johannesburg. Typical squeeze effect...economy class is a squash situation...seats too close to each other. Seating is a 2x4x2 configuration. Does not serve any alcohol on board but you can take your own (duty free from the airport) if you like wine with your dinner.

"Our plan was to fly from Heathrow to Cairo, with a connecting flight to Luxor. The first leg of the journey was fine. Plane was a little old, but the food was good and the cabin crew were efficient. The transfer from the London flight to Luxor flight was fraught because of the late departure of the Heathrow flight. Transfer was achieved in the nick of time and both us and our baggage made it to Luxor, which was a positive.

On our return flight the baggage did not make the connecting flight to London (from Cairo). The staff at the desk at baggage reclaim in Heathrow were far from understanding. They made no apologies and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. However, once we started communicating via the helpline number, we found the staff approachable, knowledgeable and supportive. All of the information we were furnished with proved to be correct and our bags were delivered to us undamaged 4 days after landing which was within their 5 day target.

"Although I once already promised myself to never fly with Egyptair, we couldn't but had to choose this airline to go from Cairo to Budapest. It was a big mistake. This is a small plane, without business class or economy plus. The toilets were very dirty, the floor was sticky with urine. The staff was unbelievably incompetent, they didn't even speak English. I travel a lot but  I have never experienced that the  flight attendants cant speak English. How is this possible? The biggest problem with this flight is that they  leave about ten suitcases at the Cairo airport or a regular basis. They just simply don't put the suitcases in the plane. We had two suitcases each (medium sized, about 14 kgs each) and they did not arrive, they were chosen not to be loaded in the plane. We got them very late next night The staff that handles the delayed luggage in Budapest told us that this is a constant problem with Egyptair's Cairo-Budapest-Cairo flights. As soon as they finish the administration of the delayed suitcases at the arrival terminal in Budapest, they start the same procedure at the departure as well because Egyptair do the same when you travel from Budapest to Cairo i.e. they don!t take all the luggage. It is very outrageous because you pay 100% price for a 70%service. I don't understand how this is possible and how come that they have never been fined or condemned by the IATA or whatever association is there for airlines. One thing is for sure: I am going to lay a complaint at every platform possible because this is a very unfair business behaviour. On our way back to Cairo from Budapest, we had to buy a new ticket (Air France, via Paris) because we just simply couldn't stand the idea of the hassle with Egyptair and the delayed suitcases again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0d/f3/71/49/colobella.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoBella,ColoBella wrote a review Aug 2018,ColoBella,,39 contributions,40 helpful votes,Cairo - Budapest,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r611857551-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"The most terrible, unprofessional, disgusting airline  - overall rating is below zero",Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"1- Business Class Check in counter officer was absent
And after almost 30 min of starting check in at the economy counter allowed my checkin through that counter.
2- At the Receiption of the airport lounge the receptionist didn’t allow me to enter and told me that Egyptair allows only its Golden card members to use the lounge. Since I was very tired and needed badly to use the lounge facilities I used my Priority Pass card to enter and they charged my account 15 BRITISH Pounds.
3. Onboard of my flight 686 to Alexandria, the plane I boarded on was very old and it’s maintenance was terribly bad. Seats stuck, most of the business class seats were in miserable condition.
4- I filed a claim onboard using the Egyptair form and handed it over to the chief of the hosting team.
5- The food was okay, the service was a little below standard. I struggled hard to open the stuck tray.
6- Just yesterday I received an amazing e-mail from the customer care, with lies about my checkin time referring to the actual departure time which was delayed almost 30 minutes. And didn’t comment on my remarks except one about the lounge, that I used my priority pass to enter.
Bad handling of claims, very old badly maintained airplanes used for most of the flights from and to Alexandria airport.
Compared to the other airlines serving on the same route and some are not direct, Egyptair is the worst compared to; Air Arabia, Saudi Airlines and Flydubai

﻿"We took Egypt Air because it is the only available direct flight from Nairobi to Cairo. I wouldn't complain about the quality of food because it was really very acceptable. Also, the flight is more or less on time which another positive point. The big two challenges with Egypt Air are safety and entertainment. For safety, you can never find the extension of seat belt on any flight. The extensions are needed for babies without seats or for above average size passengers. Also, it seams that instruction passengers to have seat up right at landing is limited to economy class only. I was sitting in the first raw of economy and the passenger f the last raw of economy kept his seat back inclined at the landing and the crew could not ask him to straighten it up. It was a direct risk for me in case of evacuation but that was hard to be understood by the crew members.

"It really wasn’t his fault. We had rebooked our trip to leave Ethiopia early (and paid handsomely for the change) I’d managed to develop a case of dysentery. The flight out of Addis to Cairo departs at 4:15 in the morning. No one is at their best at that hour but the circumstances were horrendous. For some reason there was a glitch in our booking and despite paying for business class tickets, the man at the desk wanted us to pay to check our bags. What??? It took an hour to get a manager, and it got to near bullying on both sides to get them to check 2 bags for 2 people without paying. Big bucks. (In Business Class you can check 2 PER person.) A week later when we boarded for JFK we were worried it might happen again. It did. But this time the problem was adjusted without fanfare. Im not sure why the team in Addis needed to make such a problem. The flight wasn’t full. There wasn’t an issue of weight. Is Egypt Air becoming a bargain liner? If you have an alternative, take it.

"This isn’t a genuine business class in the real sense. Seats don’t recline any more the economy and all you get extra is a foot rest. It’s the equivalent of British Airways premium economy.

The carrier only carries enough food for the seats. So if you have 2 meal choices and 20 seats, only the first 10 could get their choice. The second 10 get the default or nothing.

Business class not called to board first.

Business class bags not delivered first.

No alcohol on board.

Terrible and dated movies and little choice.

Uncomfortable seats.

It was not a great flight by any means. The plane was old and small. Food was average as we preordered seafood. They only had one film to show and it started very late. Still it just stopped 30 mins later so only entertainment was the few available radio channels. The crew members were too busy to serve the travelers properly as they said there were a traveler with a critical health condition which was true but since it was not an emergency case and they knew about this passenger before taking off then they should have taken proper measures.

"Egyptair - it's adequate. Gets you from point A to point B. And there's not much more to be said about this airline.

It is not the worst airline I have flown in my 40 + years being a travel professional. But it is far from the top of the list.

I took Egyptair to Cairo from JFK in Business Class. The service was adequate. Meal - so-so and the cabin staff were also, just adequate. Few smiles, little passenger interaction, seemed like they were not in the least bit interested.

At least that's what I came to believe when I was allocated a 'broken' window seat. I asked for assistance and got a 'no care' attitude. Could have offered to move me etc. but didn't. There are many ways to win a passenger. I wasn't offered one.

The aircraft was unnecessarily hot inside. I thought it was only me but came to realize that many passengers were very uncomfortable indeed.I began to wonder if the heated cabin was a tactic to get us acclimated for the soaring temperatures in Egypt.

Again - it's adequate. It stays up in the air. What more could one ask for.

"At the suggestion of our B&B host in Luxor, I booked our Aswan to Abu Simbel flights as soon as they became available. We went with the earliest flight from Aswan to make the most of our time at Abu Simbel, but still getting back to Aswan late morning (6:55am leaving Aswan, arriving Abu Simbel 7:40am, return flight leaving Abu Simbel 10:40am and arriving Aswan 11:25am). I then booked on a separate itinerary (because the flights were not available to purchase at the same time) a flight from Aswan to Cairo for the same afternoon, leaving Aswan at 2:30pm. This allowed us 3 hours between flights - plenty of time for domestic flights.

The week before flying, I was sent an email saying that the 6:55am flight had been cancelled and we had been moved to a later flight. This later flight had a knock on effect that basically meant we were arriving in Abu Simbel at the time we had previously been due to LEAVE, AND our time at the ancient site had been reduced to one hour. The later flight returning to Aswan meant that we were cutting it too fine to make our final flight of the day to Cairo, 45min between landing and take off, and with checked bags, the airline recommended we change our later flight, too.

The problem with changing our later flight was that it was full except for business class, and so with no choice, and refusal on their part to accept ANY responsibility and thus not provide ANY discount or assistance, we wore the cost. The change of flight also meant we were stuck at Aswan airport for 4 hours between the two flights. The whole thing was a complete stuff up.

Not only were we not impressed by this treatment, but the planes themselves were not cleaned properly between flights, and we boarded to rubbish on the floor and a general grubbiness throughout.

If given the choice, I would not fly with EgyptAir again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bontaks,Bontaks wrote a review Jul 2018,Bontaks,"Sydney, Australia",639 contributions,306 helpful votes,Aswan - Cairo,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r596785392-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Flight changes left us out of pocket,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Trying to send my 14 year old daughter  over to my family who reside in Cairo has been one nightmare after another. We originally had a fare of £400.00 which has now in the space of a couple of weeks doubled and then some! If she travels as a minor they charge you an unaccompanied minor fare on top of the child fare, but she is 14, so suddenly no longer a allowed to be child, but an adult fare. Now we are up to £600. As she can’t travel as a minor, although paying an adult fare, I still have to pay for her to travel as a UM. Meaning we have to now pay yet another chunk of money on top of an adult fare. How is it possible to travel on an adult fare, yet have to charge a UM as well. How is that even possible. I’m fuming as this trip which originally had a budget of £600 has now ran into nearly £1000. The website is hopeless and the travel agent contradicted what we were originally told. So who the hell knows the regs???? Seems nobody does, but you are just expected to keep throwing money to cover costs at every level. I’m raging beyond belief.

"Pilots are still given carte blanche to smoke in the cockpit here, as I was told by the flight attendant. On this and my connecting flight the entire cabin smelled strongly of cigarettes, both fresh and stale at various points. As an asthmatic, pregnant passenger, this is 100% unacceptable. Nicotine gum is available for the addict, but me and my unborn child had no option but to endure an unhealthy situation for a total of 8+ hours, despite asking flight attendants about it.

"Online check-in opens 48 hrs before departure.  Be warned, at Heathrow you will be in for a good hike to get to the B gates which are not situated in the main terminal building.

It was amusing to think that the young good looking lady in the video really has such a stern English voice.The plane is a Boeing 777 which doesn't have individual air conditioning nozzles for each passenger.  I found the cabin a bit warm to start with but it cooled to a comfortable temperature during flight.Leg room was 'normal' which for me translates to 'very uncomfortable' because I'm 6'3"".

"First time with Egyptair, and reading reviews I went in with very low expectations. So experience was not as dismal as I thought but definitely not the business class you’d expect from an international flight.
Good parts: charging port in seat, and service is friendly.
Not so good parts: seats are in 2-3-2 arrangement so pick your seats to avoid getting stuck in middle row. First leg of my trip, the arm rest came unstuck in the seat next to mine. Wiped down arm rest with the warm towel and it was dirty. Seats are almost fully reclined but got stuck a few times and had to get staff to help straighten.
Headset is flimsy, few new movies available. Food arrives and hot meal portion comes quite later, placed open without any cover and pushed on a trolley. It’s edible.
On the way there, they had no amenity kits (they ran out of inventory 3 weeks ago). Return trip had a bag but oddly had only headphones, pen, etc
Not specific to Egyptair, but the Cairo business lounges at the airport are terrible (and I tried all of them). Wifi was hard to connect to and does not remain stable. Some lounges are smoking lounges and you can barely breathe in there (but those have the most stable wifi). Food in lounge is baked goods that are unappetizing and looks quite stale. Quite likely the most boring airport I’ve been stuck in. Had one duty-free guy near the F gates telling me credit cards system was down and asking for cash (and getting change back was like pulling teeth).
Would not pick this airline unless the price was really low (but know that you get what you pay for). And would definitely avoid Cairo airport or keep transit as short as possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/69/38/53/ranipendse.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranipendse,ranipendse wrote a review Jul 2018,ranipendse,"Toronto, Canada",376 contributions,83 helpful votes,Toronto - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r593991954-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Old planes, basic service ",Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Once you're on the plain everything is fine, but our trip with EgyptAir was far from perfect before then.
To start off with, we travelled form Luxor to Amsteram but needing a connecting flight in Cairo, the man behind the counter didn't want to label our luggage to Amsterdam directly so we needed to check those in again in Cairo. The bus that picked us up from the plane in Cairo to the arrival hall had wet seats, which was impossible to see until you sat down. When we picked-up our luggage we went to the 'connecting flight' location, unfortunately after 30 minutes waiting and passing by several airport employees we were told that we had taken the wrong queue, they also asked why our luggage was not labelled to Amsterdam directly. When we answered that they didn't want to do this we were told that we 'just had to ask for a manager there, as it's not the normal way of doing things'. Once we were at the right location, at the check-in desk in Cairo, we inquired if it was possible to buy an upgrade to business class, this was possible but only in US dollars, for some reason. We agreed and discussed that we had to change some money and go to the ATM, which was fine with him. After returning to the desk with all the agreed upon money the man behind the desk informed us that there were only two seats left (we were with three), as one was given away during our ATM visit. Of course we were not happy with this because we had already agreed that we would take the seats, plus we now actually lost money at the ATM (transaction fee) and the money change counter (changing EURO to USD).

Back in the Netherlands we filed a complaint but never heard back anything, I guess customer satisfaction is not important. I'd recommend to look for an alternative if possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/8e/c0/98/leonvonk.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonVonk,LeonVonk wrote a review Jul 2018,LeonVonk,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",35 contributions,5 helpful votes,Cairo - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r593640624-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Bad experience,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Check in was not at all friendly even though we traveled business class. The staff at the counters are not courteous and least bothered about the comfort of the passengers. We were supposed to get a pass a check in for the Business lounge but did not get it. Later when we went to the business lounge at Athens they declined to let us in. The next halt was at Cairo where we were allowed in the business lounge- No vegetarian -there is no one to help you here, WiFi was awful-gets disconnected every few seconds- seats are so low that it is as though you are sitting on the floor- bad for people with bad backs. In the flight the seat cushioning was torn and very dirty, the seats could not be put completely flat like the other airlines. Was told that there was no vegetarian food from Athens to Cairo so was compelled to fly fasting. Next flight from Cairo to Mumbai was told that there was only one vegetarian and they had to get one from economy class. Attendants were OK. Awful experience flying ""business class"".

"The crew were not only indifferent to the passengers, a crew member (flying standby?) seated in front of us threw some sort of a snit that wound-up involving at least 4 other crew members, sometimes 3 at a time, blocking the aisle, over a period of over 3 hours. His hurt feelings seemed to involve his meal, which he was pleaded with to eat, again - over several hours, with him getting up, indignant and inconsolable. Meanwhile, the passengers were served the crummy meal about an hour into a 5+ hour flight and ignored for the rest of the flight.

"The biggest disappointment of my recent family vacation to Egypt was certainly the airline Egypt Air. The trip started with an unpleasant experience when the flight was delayed from Mumbai and there was no announcement made by the airline. The passengers just crowded at the gate and were kept waiting without any information on the cause of the delay or the revised time. Next in store was the missing luggage at Luxor which arrived only after 12 hrs and we had to adjust our trip plan in Luxor to make an additional trip to the airport to collect the luggage (no, the airline didn't deliver the luggage at the hotel where we were staying). Things went worse in Aswan when we were not let to board the ASW-CAI flight as it was apparently overbooked! Imagine arriving at the airport 2 hrs ahead of the flight and not being able to board, and our trip plan went for a toss as the next day we were planned to start early from Cairo to visit the pyramids. And it turns out the only people who were left behind were us and another asian passenger - looked like a case of racial profiling (inspired by another Star Alliance member airline?). Finally we were put on an early morning flight the next day, which I had avoided in the first place while booking the tickets even though it was cheaper, as I didn't want the hassle of early morning travel with kids. Unfortunately, Egypt Air may be the only option for flying within Egypt (there may be other airlines, but very limited flight options), but wherever possible I recommend to avoid this airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SomeshTraveler,Somesh J wrote a review Jul 2018,Somesh J,"Pune, India",6 contributions,1 helpful vote,Mumbai - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r592398849-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Unreliable on time, Missing baggage, Flights overbooked",Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our Egypt air experience was less than average. Check-in took forever and the staff kept blaming system issue for it. Once on the flight, service was nothing impressive. Pillows and blankets were only given when asked for, entertainment was dated, hardly any new movies or good TV shows. Seats and legroom were cramped.
The worst part was the food. We had ordered for asian vegetarian and all we got was boiled veggies. There was no snacks or other options available. We struggled on the 6 hour long flight.

"Egyptair flights for me are a good service, the only down side is that they almost always are late on there departure, but seem to get to there destination on time. The aircraft are quite new 777s the seats have good leg room and the inflight meal is better than some other airline that I have been on.
The one down side is Cairo airport security, it is a nightmare, it is one level of staffing, whether it it is 10 passengers or 100 passengers and it is one speed, slow. So Egyptair 8/9 out of 10.

"It was a milestone to fly back to Italy with Egyptair MS 705 on 25th January 2018 from Cairo to Malpensa .

After a business time of few days in Cairo and Ain Soukhna , the relaxing flight was capable to give me the energy spent in the many hours of car travel in Cairo and outside , and spent in very important meetings to recover the egyptian market . It was done . The plane was very clean ,
the chairs of the business class are very comfortable , more than european airways ,
the meal at a level more than the european airways ,
the media as music with wide choice , to an extent that I was involved with egyptian music , and movies were really exciting and accompanying me on the flight very softly .
But the main thanks I have to give to the very kind hostesses , for the accurate service on board , an expert lady very charming and two young lady very thoughtful , all with a stunning smile , unusual on the european flights .

I am convinced that many colleagues of them , belonging to other european airways , should learn from them how to treat a customer , as I was for them on the flight . And I was a normal customer for them , not a VIP , but I had a VIP treatment .
Thanks to them and to the crew , it will be for me a pleasure to take always Egyptair also for other destinations .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/64/39/39/armando-f.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639armandof,ARMANDO F wrote a review Jun 2018,ARMANDO F,,5 contributions,2 helpful votes,Cairo - Milan,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r590129357-EGYPTAIR-World.html,piacevolissimo viaggio - extremely charming flight,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew Egyptair to Jordan based on the recommendation of an acquaintance and because it was the most efficient way to get to Jordan from Toronto. Our decision to fly business class was worthwhile so that we could have an opportunity to rest comfortably on the long flight.  The leg room was excellent and the seat quite comfortable. The flights left on time.   The food quality was marginal for business class and the lounge in Cairo was comfortable enough but had the worst selection of food and beverages of any I have experienced.  My major issue was that our luggage was lost on the way to Jordan and that Egyptair was horrific to deal with.  Despite multiple calls and emails by us and our travel company and hotel staff no information was made available, calls were not returned ( despite promise to do so) leaving us frustrated and without any of our clothes.  We anticipated we would hear of our luggage arrival within a few days but ultimately got back to Canada 2 wk later without our luggage.  Ultimately it was declared lost and again after multiple emails and completed forms, I have just learned that the airline will compensate us for 1/5 of the value of the luggage and content and no additional compensation for the items we needed to buy for our 2 wk vacation( significantly less that agreed on at the ""Montreal convention"" re passengers rights) .  The frustration in dealing with the customer service and the lack of responsibility or follow through has been atrocious.

"We had our flights dramatically changed about a week or so before leaving London. This was very costly for us as:
1. We needed to pay for an additional nights accommodation
2. We needed to take additional not paid time off of work
3. I had to spend days worth of effort on the phone with the airline and hotel and tour guides etc to ensure our itinerary and everything was re-organised.

Egyptair has very poor customer service and was not helpful before or during travel. They were rude on the phone and after waiting for 30 minutes to get through the first time someone didn’t realise I was patched through and took a personal call I could hear so I had to hang up and wait in the queue for another 30 minutes only to get talked to in a rude manner. When getting our boarding passes we also had sub par customer service. We would’ve hoped they would have offered to pay for our accommodation but they said not a chance. At the airport we thought as a gesture since the flight wasn’t full that they may be willing to bump us up to business class (as almost all the seats were empty). And they just said no they gave us more than 24 hours notice so we could’ve cancelled the trip so too bad so sad basically. I find this really disappointing as we were being very fair and reasonable and it is unreasonable to expect us to cancel a trip a week out when other flights and tours are already booked. That would leave us incurring even more financial loss. In the end it was made clear that they’re not willing to do anything but the bear minimum despite any financial loss we incurred because of their schedule changes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474linzij,Linzi J wrote a review Jun 2018,Linzi J,,3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cairo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r586568938-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Changed flights at short notice incurring additional expense with no customer service,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The actual flight and check-in experience was not a problem. The problem was they suddenly added 24 hour to my itinerary the day before my trip.  I found out by chance. I filed a complaint twice and a comment to the CEO but received not a word...NO response at all, not even a ""we received your message email.""  I had to find out my flight was changed on my own and report to my job that I would have to take a leave without pay and also book an extra night in a hotel.  Apparently they simply do not care.  I am no prima donna and am very flexible when the rare change has to be made, but this was unprofessional and seemed even a bit hateful.

"We travel a lot and not always to the most touristic locations, however this time it was Cairo, our home for the coming years.

We chose Egyptair because it was a direct flight, something that is quite handy if you travel with two young kids. It started fine, the flight attendants seemed friendly and helpful, however that changed later in the flight. My son got ill and of course that little bag was not where it should be... and no one to be found. Luckily one of the three had a bag, so he could puke without making a mess. When a flight attendant finally did show up she refused to take the bag (and seemed moody, perhaps she had been sleeping?!) and almost threw the new bag at me instead of giving it normally.

Also some issues with the earplugs, but other than that no real complaints.

Other airliners like Emirates, KLM and even Air Maroc have something for kids, to keep them distracted and simply as a small gift, however that was not the case... not a serious issue, but just a small thing that makes you feel that little bit extra as a customer.

No flight info was given during our flight, also non for those with connecting flights, again nothing serious, but just that little bit extra service.....

We will fly again, but simply because this is the easiest and cheapest option.

Not the worst flight I have had, but also very far from the best flight. Still they get you from A to B safely and without any delay.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/f3/ec/f6/ronald-jelle.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronald_jelle,Ronald_jelle wrote a review Jun 2018,Ronald_jelle,"The Hague, The Netherlands",2635 contributions,725 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r584852128-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Had better service, but seen worse too",Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had booked to fly from Cairo to Luxor on Monday 30th April when a dust storm enveloped lower Egypt.  Our flight was the first delayed and we waited in the airport from 1500 hours until 0400 the next day - 13 hours.  During which time the only communication we received was a notice saying that more information would be given at 0100 hours.  It wasn't.  Mohammed El Hady of Egyptair told us that all flights would resume in the order they were delayed.  They weren't.  Flights resumed at 0200 hours and it was another two hours before we noticed people starting to move to the flight gate.  Lo and behold, it was our turn to go !  We could well have been left in the airport.                                                               To cap things off, another flight from Cairo to Milan was re-scheduled with no notification until 2 days prior to the flight leaving, in spite of us having an earlier connecting flight from Aswan which meant we would have missed the Milan flight.  This in spite of us being a member of their frquent flier program.We came across the re-scheduling by accident.As Aswan airport is so far out of town, I would counsel anyone flying from Aswan to Cairo to take the overnight train.

"Both egyptair & cairo airport feel like they r more than 10 years behind most other airlines.
My worst experience came when flying with a toddler, most other airlines we travelled with provided seat belt extension for babies, however Egyptair doesn't, and when I asked for it the flight attendant said they r not safe & better if his mother hold him!!! R u kidding? I asked what if the mother fell asleep or went unconscious! He had no answer, anyway that is not so different from driving in Cairo!
In general, it's not a cheap airlines however their airplanes are as old (in some cases even older) with uncomfortable seats & no entertainment at the seat (except headphones they distribute so that ppl can head into the radio or the boring old movies they play in shared small screens).

The aircraft, a Boeing 737, was clean, somewhat dated but appeared well-kept, and my window seat was comfortable and provided good legroom. Check-in and boarding both went smoothly and without any significant delay. I enjoyed the beverage and snack service.

The cabin crew members were friendly, polite, and helpful. Also, the members I spoke with, could speak very good English.

I selected EgyptAir based on it being a Star Alliance partner, and thus my gold status gives me advance boarding. I also considered price, its reputation, and that it is Egypt’s major airline.

I like its logo design. Very suitable for an Egyptian airline.

"For me, Egyptair was just another airline, a means for getting from Point A to Point B. The inflight service was OK. The entertainment was not spectacular, but I was able to find a couple of movies I liked.

What really got me, and what will bring me back to Egyptair in the future, is how I was treated during my layover. I deliberately scheduled a very long layover in Cairo, so that I could go see the Pyramids. I figured, my suitcase is checked; all I need is my backpack with a few things. What I didn't count on is that, if you are laying over in Cairo for more than a few hours (I don't know what the cutoff is), Egyptair gets you a room in a 5-star hotel for the duration!!

That's right: I was able to go through passport control, check into a very nice hotel room where I left my stuff, go to the pyramids, and still come back in time for a nap and a shower in a first-class hotel. Breakfast and lunch buffet were included.

"I went from Athens to Bangkok and back to Athens again n April this year. While on the way there we were flying on newer and modern machines, on the way back it felt like flying 20 years ago with a staff that was initially overwhelmed and actually not able to manage to fit in the hand luggage above the seats. Ground staff and finally manager themselves had to be called. Our seats (three of them) could not be placed backwards in ""sleeping mode"". The same happened to other people.  Some seats could not be moved upright, while this is required during takeoff and landing. Staff we're responding in an embarrassed way and acting as as if they were fully aware of the conditions but to ashamed to admit it and basically not doing anything about it at all. No individual entertainment screens on the front seats (even if in the booking it clearly stated otherwise).

"Travelled out to Cairo with Lufthansa. 4 hour flight from Frankfurt. Old Airbus, no entertainment, Once we had been served our drink and meal the Stewards disappered for the rest of the flight.

"As far as for the flying part I could say it was an average flight. What really annoyed us was that our flight on our way home was cancelled with no prior notice. We were flying at  around 15:00 hours to Athens and they replaced that flight with an early morning flight. No excuse about why the flight was cancelled, we never found out. No excuse, about why they didn’t notify us to catch the other flight in the morning, all they said they had no contact information. Who could possibly book a flight without contact info nowadays??

"This is what I sent to Egyptair in summary of my experience: I had the worst experience in my 30 years of flying with Egypt Air this past week. Just some of my issues flying business class: your Fast Track is slower than the other people going through passport control for economy class, so please advise the advantage of having FastTrack, on both entering Egypt and leaving Egypt. Your food (breakfast) was 3 dried pieces of meat curling on the edges (disgusting) and some dried cheese and fruit (no hot meal on business class?) I have never experienced this is 30 years of flying.

I was told when booking in, that they had to change planes so there was no longer full lying down seats - now I guess these things happen however I was told they would refund me $50, are they serious, is this what they think this downgrade is worth, $50, the difference between economy and business, shocking. Plus I have to, when I arrive home, go into their offices to get the refund. It will cost me more to waste my time to fetch this refund so how does this make any sense whatsoever? The online entertainment sẏstem was the worst I have ever seen, firstly the system is archaic, secondly, the flight info was not available on screen ""error"", one couldn't see what movie you were about to watch, all it said was video, so you had to start each video in order to see the movie before deciding, incredible for business class let alone economy class.

The poor hostess was so sweet and trying her best but this was a disaster.

I can't wait to see how they respond to this review because I have emailed them now 3 times to find out what they are going to do about this and they have responded as per below keep asking me who I am and what seat I sat on, they should be able to see this on their records and I assume they will do nothing about this.

""Dear our valued customer
First we would like to offer our apology for the inconvenience happened, Kindly send your ticket number, seat number and the kind of meal that was served to you in order to investigate this matter.
Thanks For cooperation.""
They don't even know my name after I emailed them all my flight details and name and contact details and then again they email me

""Dear Our Valued customer,
We have inquiry concerning your case Number: FM201812713174
kindly send your ticket number "" and still no resolve and still waiting.

To call someone a valued customer you should mean it.

To top it all, their business class lounges at Cairo airport would rank the worst I have been in. Food too was terrible and seating minimal, old and dated. Someone at Egyptair needs to take a flight to the middle east with Qatar Airways or other and visit Qatar or Bahrain airports and see what true service is.

As I stated the worst trip in 30 years of flying, so until they do something about their shocking service I highly recommend no matter how good the rate they offer, do not fly Egyptair.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/54/1c/2b/leon-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeL8,Leon L wrote a review May 2018,Leon L,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",204 contributions,57 helpful votes,Cairo - Johannesburg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r580901603-EGYPTAIR-World.html,The worst flight of my 30 year flying experience....such a let down grrrr,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"So obviously I was worried having a flight from Bangkok to London Heathrow with a stopover in Cairo after reading all of the bad reviews however it was that I got on this flight as I had missed my previous return a few weeks before with a different airline or I had to pay an extra £200-£300 to flight with a different airline. So of course.. I risked it.
However I really don’t know what everyone is complaining about. I agree it’s not the best airline, but definitely not the worst.
Flight from Bangkok to Cairo:
Downfall to this flight was that there was only One tv for everyone at the front of the seating sections, and only one film played. However it was a 9hour flight at 1am in the morning so I just slept most the way and read a little of my book. I would recommend taking yourself some entertainment or a book. Headphones were provided in the seat in front of you did want to watch the 1 film being played.
Dinner was not the best but you know airplane food. Choice of Fish or Chicken (I had chicken) & rice, bread roll, salad, desert and chocolate bar. Soft drink and tea. Tea brought round a bit too quickly after but maybe this is them trying to make up for bad reviews as people had written about waiting ages for drinks.
Metal cutlery with my dinner was a bonus!
Breakfast however I really enjoyed, possibly the best breakfast I had on a flight. An omelette, sausage, tomatoes & little potatoes. 2 bread rolls with butter, cream cheese & jam. Fruit bowl. Orange juice. Had to quickly ask for a glass of water before they ran away with the trolley but then she happily gave me one. Tea/coffee came straight after again.
One good thing about this flight experience, maybe because of all the bad reviews the flight wasn’t very full so everyone had a lot of space and extra pillows and blankets as there was one of each on every seat. We had 3 seats between two, some people were lying down with 3/4 seats to themselves.
Each seat had its own individual really good legroom.
Flight from Cairo to London Heathrow:
This flight had individual TVs was great for me as I was wide awake on this flight having slept most of my previous flight and in Thai time it was 2pm for me and my body clock so I needed some entertainment. Although I had my book 5 hours 25minutes of reading is a little bit too much for me. The leg space on this flight was slightly smaller than the last flight but average for a flight I would say. Plus I had three seats all to myself. I actually took time to read the Egypt air in-flight magazine before we took off and now have to make some plans to come back and visit and travel lots of Egypt that was unknown to me. About an hour into the flight we were offered a drink I got orange juice and a water. We were then Given a small cake. whilst others were sleeping I was watching a film one of the flight attendants came by personally to make sure I was okay and to check if I needed anything which I thought was nice service. Before we landed for lunch there was an option of beef or chicken (I had beef) & rice with salad bread roll and cake. I really enjoyed my lunch! Really tasty.. I also had water and apple juice. The air hostess that served me lunch was very nice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilxb227,aprilxb227 wrote a review May 2018,aprilxb227,"Risca, United Kingdom",36 contributions,44 helpful votes,Bangkok - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r579533056-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Pleasantly surprised,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am travelling very often from Egypt to Cyprus (sometimes more than 6 times per year). Egypt Air, is always on time, have an excellent service, helpful and friendly staff on board and on check in points.
The only thing that I have to mentioned is to take care more the suitcases and to have better fares for a short trips like Cyprus. The fares are very expensive compare to other destinations.

I am disabled so it is imperative that I get on/off either last or first but the staff put myself and 2 other disabled travellers on in the middle of the boarding so we had to spend time standing and waiting, something very difficult to do if you are disabled.

"Flew EgyptAir from Mumbai to Cairo and back. Both times there was limited blankets and pillows and I didn't get any both times. On the flight back when someone complained over the shortage of blankets, the staff increased the heat on the plane. Worked fine for me but some elderly folks did feel suffocated and sick. It was a lame idea .. instead just have blankets and pillows for all, at-least match the number of seats on your plane!! The in-flight entertainment was as good as not having any. Not sure if it was the plane model or what but both times I got the common TV screen and had to watch whatever was playing on it. They did not have the TV on the back of each seat thing and funnily the headphones I got (only during the return journey, the onward didn't even give that) had pins that did not match the socket on the handle .. I mean ... seriously ?! Not sure if all were like that or just mine as I didn't bother to check.Food was also strictly okay.If you are looking for an economic option and don't mind the things i mentioned then you can go for it.

"I was flying on April 08 from New York. There was a mechanical problem in the flight and the airline had to cancel the whole trip. There is nothing they could do in regard of mechanical problems. I am a star alliance gold member. The clerk came to the lounge to inform the passengers about the Cancellation after 4 hours. The flight normally departs at 6.30 pm the clerk informed us at 10.30 pm. Egypt air employee was unaware of all details. Whenever I asked him a question, the answer was: "" I donno!!! I am not an engineer to give details""!!! Luckily the airline provided us a stay at crown Plaza JFK with dinner and breakfast. The next day On April 09th I was informed at 11 AM that I have to check out in 5 minutes as we will be going to the airport to depart to Cairo. Too bad!! At least give me half an hour to get myself ready. However I was exhausted enough and wanted to go back to Cairo. The company provided a bus to go to the baggage claim in JFK to take the baggage and recheck-in on Egypt air counters. I paid 6$ for the cart to move the luggage from one floor to another. At the check-in Egypt Air provided a 10$ lunch voucher!!!! I paid 6$ for the Cart at the airport and the airline is providing me a 10$ lunch voucher!!!!!!! I have been in the airport since 1 pm and the flight was at 6.35 pm. Seriously? ??? I was admitted to the airport 5 hours and a half prior to my departure with a 10$ voucher !!!! Come on Egypt air you can do better, and please give your employees a training on how to deal with customers!!!

The good thing about the airline is that it provides 2 bags 23 kilos each for each passenger on this flight. It's a direct flight from Cairo so it's the shortest route.

"I took a number of flights with Egyptair in the span of a month with mixed experiences.

My flights took me from Amman to Cairo, Cairo to Aswan, Luxor to Cairo, Cairo to Munich.

The planes varied from really old and wearing out to brand new.
The older planes had no entertainment, old worn out seats, and great flight attendants. The newer planes had seatback TVs, newer (but firm) seats, and grouchy flight attendants.

A pleasure to fly on an airline that seems keen on the comfort of passengers. Seats in economy offer reasonable legroom - spacious compared with some carriers - inflight entertainment OK with a good selection of movies. Arrived on time and in one piece.

"No complaints. Boarding was easy and our flight was on-time. The seats were reasonably comfortable and there is more leg room than most planes in the U.S. the staff was not overly warm but pleasant enough. Like most airlines, the food isn't the greatest in the world but decent enough. It was better than most meals on airlines in the USA. They give you real silverware. You do not get to choose when to open or close your window shade. They dictate that. Entertainment was limited. There is a handful of movies but nothing wonderful- enough to pass the time. The landing and deplane went smooth. Overall, no complaints. It was the only non-stop flight from NY to Cairo so it was best option to get to Egypt. I thought it was a good value too.

Nothing satisfied me, I also expected the airline to perhaps provide a kids meal because normally other airlines do.

Additionally there was a couple of times where i asked the cabin crew to get me either a blanket or re fill of a drink and the problem with that was when i asked the cabin crew  he said yes but didn't bring me what i asked for , I understand they have a busy job but keeping your customers satisfied and pleased is important too.

"Absolutely horrendous airline. The plane itself was dirty, the seats falling apart at the seams and the tray tables were dislodged and wonky. It felt like a plane from the early 1990s and certainly wasn't what I was expected. There was no in-flight entertainment, magazine, anything offered. The seats did not even have jacks for headphones. Granted, I wasn't expecting a world-class service, but I did hope that the plane would be clean and that the chairs would be in one piece.

Service was essentially non-existent. It was almost a five hour flight, overnight, so I had hoped for a blanket, maybe a pillow to sleep. The steward/esses could offer none of that. There was no food, only available to purchase, and no drinks. It took about three hours for us to be offered a small plastic cup of water. That was all we had had to drink for hours, since arriving to the airport. After all, bottles of water are confiscated at security. We could have bought a bottle at the airport for 7 Euros 50, absolutely overpriced! Flying from a hot country, you'd have hoped that the passengers would be offered something to drink at the start and towards the end of the flight, and not ignored for hours with no service.

The only good thing, and I have to mention it is that we arrived ahead of schedule. Well done to the pilot for that.

"Had the opportunity to go for umrah using Egypt air . It was the second time since 1997 I used the airline and thought highly of it until I actually boarded . On all legs of my flight both going and returning home I was highly disappointed with the lack of attention,friendliness and consideration from the air hostess staff. They are rude ,slow in responding if asked for anything and almost make it seem like you are doing them a favour by flying this airline. On my return leg from cairo to Johannesburg I had come down with a terrible fever and was getting chills.I requested an extra blanket and told the air hostess serving my side that I was not feeling well.she yelled at me as if I was a small child and said that they do not give any extra blankets out . I left it at that .Then as I was sleeping again due to feeling ill I was harshly woken up by the same air hostess to take my food. I mean really?! I have travelled on many airlines and not once in my entire life have I been so abruptly treated by staff on a flight . My entire family of 7 all were disappointed with their service as well.

"My family of 6 took the flight from JFK to Cairo.  The plane sits 3-3-3 in economy.  We took up 2 rows.  For an adult, a teenager, and a tween, it was fairly uncomfortable.  The way back we checked the flight the night before and changed our seats to the very back of the plane to 3 row, 2 in each.  That helped quite a bit.The staff was fairly friendly.  Water is scarce.  If you ask for some, you only get a glass.  It was a real problem on the Cairo-JFK flight because you go through security at the gate and aren't allowed to take any liquid onto the plane.  I was very dry the entire flight.  The food wasn't too bad, depending upon your tastes.  My group of 6 had mixed reviews, half loving it and half-not so much.  It was standard airline food, with a middle eastern bend.  They always offer tea and coffee after each meal.  The entertainment was pretty standard, but not a large selection in English.  Plenty of action flicks, but don't expect anything sensual.  Overall it was a fairly standard, overseas flight.  Nothing special, but definitely tolerable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hatbhat,Hatbhat wrote a review Apr 2018,Hatbhat,"Kenton, Ohio",122 contributions,22 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r572770874-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Good, basic airline",Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No frills, uneventul, decent price, good airplane. Traveled on a 737-800 from DMM to CAI T3 with Egypt Air.

Typical for DMM, it was a chaotic boarding but this is not only an attribute of Egypt Air but this airport. Luggage checked all the way to Hurghada so no issues with re-checking it at CAI.

About 3 hour flight, albeit at 4 AM departure, was comfortable, kids had their own meals which were pre-ordered and seatbacks hat screens (note: no seatback screens on the way back). Flight attendants very polite and with smiles on their faces despite the odd departure time.

The flight arrived on time and parked at a remote stand. Note that taxiing at CAI may take between 15 and 20 minutes and then another 15 minutes for a bus ride to the terminal. Had a 70 minute layover going from International to Domestic flight (both Egypt Air) and made it but had to walk fast.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/88/avatar009.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CroATM,CroATM wrote a review Apr 2018,CroATM,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",10 contributions,1 helpful vote,Dammam - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r572631309-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"No frills, on time and without any issues",Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First the positive- flight was on time and there were no aircraft problems.  Luggage made it too. However—Flew home business class and not at all impressed. We chose this flight because it was non stop and left at a semi-reasonable 10 am.  Seats and business accommodations were fine but service and food was not up to industry standards.  Even the movie selections were tired.Flight attendants were indifferent at best. Hard to get service- even a coffee refill.  Any time I asked for anything- like water or another roll it took forever and they made me feel I had inconvenienced them.  (No wine etc even though it was international- not a plus)The food really was not good- mystery meats, mushy vegetables and only a “snack” service on a long flight.  FYI. after I got home my gut would recommend not eating the salad again.  We had been fine eating carefully on the trip.  I really thought an international Star Alliance flight would not be a problem....Just had the sense they didn’t care much about their passengers.  Really glad we weren’t in the back of the plane.

Delayed in Cairo. Staff was rude and not helpful at all. Waited for hours for simple decisions to be made. Demanded an extra $500 to fly out the next day. Totally not worth it.

"I flew round trip from Toronto to Lagos, stopping in Cairo in December 2017, and returning in January 2018.  The flight to Lagos was not very memorable, though we were over 45 minutes leaving Toronto.  We seemed to make up for it along the way and got in to Cairo with time to spare to make the connecting flight.  I did find the food to be bland and the on-board entertainment to be less than entertaining with limited options for English speakers.  But it was an average fight all the same.The flight out of Lagos however left me with a sour taste in my mouth and I would try to avoid flying with this airline again as a result. Our flight was over an hour late leaving Lagos as the flight coming into Lagos was late.  We weren't informed of the circumstances and were left sitting, waiting and guessing.  As there was a substantial wait at Cairo for the connecting flight, the late departure was not a concern, except the lack of information.  But when we arrived at Cairo, we found ourselves having to go through EgyptAir's customer service area wher we all stood around feeling lost.  It wasn't until we got to the counter (after a 30 minute wait in line) that we were informed that our flight was delayed by 4 hours.  I was lucky in that I was able to get a visa to enter Egypt (my own cost) and was put up in a hotel for a few hours, though not long enough to get any real sleep.  As a result I was 2 hours late getting in to Toronto and missed the bus I had booked to get home to my city.  While we were put up in a hotel and provided with meals, there was no other compensation for the inconvenience of missing buses, etc.  Again on the flight I found the food to be tasteless, the entertainment to be poor (exact same shows I had already watched on my inbound flight) and the service crew seeming to just go through the motions with no real interest in their jobs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleT505,Nicole T wrote a review Apr 2018,Nicole T,Toronto,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Toronto - Lagos,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r572233091-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Delays, not great customer service",Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Only nonstop for jfk to cairo-  so took a chance.  If you don't mind switching planes, then i would recommend Lufthansa or other major European carrier.  But otherwise a 10 1/2 hr nonstop is faster.  1) They cancelled our return flight (about a month before) and booked us on same flight a day later.  No explanation.  So we spent an extra day in Cairo we didn't need.  2) Business class-  seats do not fully recline (pretty close though), there is little separation between seats and don't sit in middle row (3 seats together).  Good movie selection.   Oh yeah-  no alcohol (although I read you can bring your own-  but didn't see anyone do that).

"Since several years I fly to BKK by Egyptair. Flight BRU-CAI is on a Boeing 737-800. Seat comfort (business class) is basic. Food and service have been improved since previous travel, specially the staff pay much more attention to the passengers.
The flight CAI-BKK was in an airbus 300-200. Such a plane should not be dedicated for long haul flights as the seat are only declinable and not flat. Service, food, attention of the staff was good but seat comfort was below expectation.
Return flight was on B777-300 having almost a flat bed. Service, food and comfort were very good.
Overall the entertainment programs have been improved in comparison to the past, and it is still a pity that no alcohol drinks are being served (keeping in mind that we past the Egyptian borders and such not longer are flying within the country). Difficult to understand that other Arabian airlines are serving alcoholic drinks even Malaysian airlines but here we have to wait until the plane is in the air. Why is that not possible for Egyptair?

"This is certainly gonna be one of the most difficult reviews I have to make. Despite my low rating of the flight, there's actually a lot of parameters affecting it and not all were so unpleasant. First of all I should mention that the staff and cabin crew was trying their utmost to make it a real pleasant flight, so kudos for that.
The good advantage that Egyptair has in Heathrow airport is the access to Air Canada's Maple Lounge, which was to the expected standard.
I can literally stop at this point to mention any other advantages, but I have to explain my experience details. I was warned of the level of service on the business class of Egyptair by many, but I chose to try it anyway due to the following reasons:
1- Egyptair is a Star Alliance member
2- Egyptair is a well established airlines that goes back to 1933
3- Egyptair is the flag carrier airline of Egypt
4- Their fleet flies to around 70 destinations worldwide
HOWEVER, despite the astonishing history of Egyptair, it is utterly failing to meet any luxurious standards.
The business class seemed a lot similar to other competitors economy class service. The seats where not comfy and it made me wonder what the economy class passengers were suffering then. The cabin crew were ""very friendly"" and lovely, yet that was the problem. Apparently they were not professionally trained to understand the difference between being professionally friendly and friend friendly. The flight attendant kept making inappropriate jokes and talking in a very unprofessional way that made me so uncomfortable most of the time. The food was not nearly as expected, even though it is catered by Do & Co. The no alcohol on board was a bit annoying, but I can let that slide as I understand it's based on a religious basis. To top that all, arriving at the Cairo airport felt no difference than being in economy class, we waited in line for more than 30 mins which made me wonder if they realize what fast track means or that for some of us time actually is important and matters.
I have to mention though that I salute the crew for doing their best, but it's not their fault as obviously they were not given the appropriate essential trainings to do so. I hope that Egyptair wakes up soon and realizes that newly established airliners such as Qatar Airways is far beyond their tiers.

"We decided on Egyptair because the business class tickets to Bangkok were super cheap. The checking in and boarding process was effective. The on-board service (including food and attentiveness of crew) was good and the seats were comfortable. Due to the long layovers in each direction, the airline arranged visas and booked us into the Le Meridian Hotel, full board at their expense. We often fly Egyptair due to price and good service.

Negatives: The airline's business lounge at Cairo Airport is not very good and the amenity kit is inferior - the worse I have seen in any long haul business class.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashtono,ashton o wrote a review Apr 2018,ashton o,"Johannesburg, South Africa",74 contributions,23 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Bangkok,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r570124878-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"EgyptAir provides a third-party option for a less-expensive upgrade to Business class on their flights via Optiontown.  Although I used this service with no repercussions on my outbound flight (JFK-CAI), I had no intention of making use of Optiontown on my return flight home.  Now here is the bad part: Egyptair's staff in its regional offices within Egypt is so incompetent that they are unaware of the nature of the Optiontown upgrade, and far from being adept at dealing with the intricacies, they are completely unsuccesful at handling them.  All I wanted to do was to change my return flight (purchased in Economy) to a later day in order to attend a wedding.  Egyptair regional offices told me and my colleague who is an experienced Egyptian travel operator that there ""was nothing they could do for me"" because my reservation was ""blocked"" by Optiontown.  Upon contacting Optiontown (which is not easy!), I finally discovered that Egyptair staff was incorrect.  However, Optiontown is not willing to make ANY contact with Egyptair on a traveler's behalf.  Finally I decided to have my colleague try at another office in another city in Egypt, and was able to make a change in my flight itinerary for a fee.  However, the amount of time and frustration wasted was not worth the tiny savings in the cost of the outbound upgrade in class.  I will use Egyptair again only because I have to, but I will not use Optiontown for anything further, as the Egyptian staff are too poorly trained to understand what it is and what the limits are - they run scared and wave a memo from their superiors telling them that a passenger who has any relationship with Optiontown cannot be helped by them (not true in this case- I was not seeking an upgrade in class, just a change in day of  travel).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mennefer,Mennefer wrote a review Mar 2018,Mennefer,"New York City, New York",11 contributions,18 helpful votes,New York City - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r569070264-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Think twice before using Optiontown for EgyptAir upgrades!,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew EGYPTAIR for a recent vacation to Egypt. We had 6 flights with EGYPTAIR in total, and the issues started before our vacation.

One of our flights was canceled, causing us issues, and leaving no good flight times to get home on the day we'd originally planned. We were rebooked, but the new flights put us getting home around 3 a.m. on a workday. We had to cut our vacation one day short to make it work for us. Luckily, EGYPTAIR was helpful in getting this rescheduled for us. We also had a scheduled flight delay that put us behind schedule.

Of our flights that were at the originally scheduled time, only one of them managed to take off without a delay.

On one flight, we were waiting in the gate for a long time, obviously delayed because of the time but we were given no announcement, then asked to follow an employee to a totally different gate. You go through security at the gate and there is nothing, not even a vending machine, there. So we went through security twice that time.

No priority boarding was offered with children. We had a lap infant and were never offered a safety belt for him, as has been done on every other airline we have flown with him on (Lufthansa, KLM, Turkish, Olympic Air, Bangkok Airways, Gulf Air). I buckled him up with me and was told to unbuckle and just hold him.

We flew economy but there appeared to be no benefit to business class besides priority boarding (seating looked exactly the same).

On almost every flight, we smelled someone smoking in the cabin (maybe this is the benefit of business class??).

The food was among the worst airplane food I've had.

In-flight entertainment was an Egyptian movie in Arabic (English subtitles).

The plane definitely wasn't as nice as other airlines we've flown. The domestic planes were much better than the one we had for our international flight (though we always seem to get not as nice aircrafts coming out of DMM).

Almost every flight required you to board a bus to board/exit.

Customer service was mixed. Some of the advance customer service we received was really good, but we also had some rude employees during our travel.

One good thing I can say is, it was cheap. Definitely, the cheapest option to fly to/from Egypt. If you have the ability to avoid, though, I would.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/72/8d/c2/jennifer-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenPHolloway,Jennifer H wrote a review Mar 2018,Jennifer H,"Houston, Texas",554 contributions,89 helpful votes,Dammam - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r569013965-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Bad,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was our first time flying EgyptAir and we were very pleasantly surprised.

It was only an hour and a half flight, however we got a meal and drinks served, which was quite unexpected. And I am not talking about a packaged croissant or some pretzels - see picture. The meal was an actual meal - plentiful and delicious.

All of EgyptAir's staff that we encountered was pleasant and friendly - from the ground staff, to the air stewards and stewardesses. Service was fast and efficient and accompanied by a smile.

The seats were comfy and not tiny, as one would expect on such a short flight. There were also a pillow and a blanket on each flight - some of the airlines nowadays charge extra for that, so although we did not use them, we appreciated that they were available free of charge.

We looked forward to our next flight (Cairo-Rome) with EgyptAir which was booked for March 8. Expedia changed our itinerary and because of their employees' incompetence we were stranded at Cairo airport . The Expedia agent tried to pass the responsibility onto EgyptAir and made me run between terminals to talk to a live person at EgyptAir's desk.

We dealt with Ibrahim, who was professional and knowledgeable and really wanted to help us. His colleague and supervisor came over and tried to see how they can get us on another flight. Since Expedia booked the itinerary (and issued e-tickets belonging to EgyptAir on an AirItalia flight...), Ibrahim and his supervisor were not able to amend our booking, so we ended up stranded for over 24 hours. However, they demonstrated that they genuinely cared about us and the predicament Expedia put us in, more than Expedia did. And that meant a lot to us.

On March 9, we made flight 795 to Rome on EgyptAir and were once again impressed by the service, food and efficiency of our flight experience from start to finish.

Would definitely fly with them again and strongly recommend them!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/97/2e/d2/turbo-zla.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turbo_Zla,Jessica D wrote a review Mar 2018,Jessica D,"Sicklerville, New Jersey",294 contributions,40 helpful votes,Amman - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r568945894-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Comfy seats, great customer service, hearty meals",Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from Heathrow to Cairo with Egyptair at the end of February 2018 and then from Hurghada to Cairo and then back to London with the same carrier at the beginning of March.Here are some thoughts.Baggage check-in was very efficient, as was embarking and dis-embarking on and off the plane.The London to Cairo was in a Boing 777 and the return from Cairo was a smaller 737.  Both planes seemed relatively new and the seating areas were clean.  The cabin staff were all helpful and friendly.The on-board entertainment was a little limited, with a somewhat narrow choice of films and television programmes.Also disappointing was the quality of the in-flight catering.  Having flown economy with a number of other carriers, I know that the bar isn’t set that high when it comes to food and drink.   However,  Egyptair do not serve alcoholic drinks at all, so in that sense there was not even a bar.  Other Islamic country based carriers, such as Emirates and Qatar do serve wine and spirits, so this was something of an unwelcome surprise.  In addition, soft drinks such as Coca Cola were served out of large bottles, rather than individual small cans and the fruit juices were heavily sweetened.  The main meal served was rather bland, with a nondescript starter and an over-sweetened pudding.All this sounds rather critical of Egyptair.  However at the end of the day, most people want to get from A to B as cheaply and safely as possible and arrive on time.  Egyptair fulfilled all these criteria. To have used a rival carrier would have cost the best part of an extra £50 per leg.  Personally I am happy to forgo an alcoholic drink and put up with a so-so meal, if it saves me a hundred pounds.  You pays your money and you takes your choice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolmh347,Malcolm H wrote a review Mar 2018,Malcolm H,"Grimsby, United Kingdom",156 contributions,162 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r568255871-EGYPTAIR-World.html,A 'dry-run' with Egyptair,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had 3 bags and the Egypt Air company employee make a trouble with me and didn't let me carry the third handbag with me on the plane and he insisted to take it in the check in as a third bag also he made me pay 100 euro extra fees for this extra bag.
but when I arrived to Cairo I didn't receive the third bag and I did a report in Egypt Air company & all what they did was emailing the Fiumocino airport and told me that the bag was still there in Rome and didn't come with the flight.

"This is the first time that I flew by this airline.
The check in took a lot of time as the airline had put a number
of apprentices to man the counters. But the staff were very good
and helpful. They will improve with experience.
The plane was old but good. It was rather sad to see that
inspite of operating on an overnight international sector , this
airline did not have sufficient pillows and blankets for all passengers.
A number of passengers went on complaining but to no avail.
Similarly for the food there was a lot of confusion about the Hindu Meal passengers being served non vegetarian dish. I think this was not the airline's
fault. The passengers need to clarify while booking whether they prefer Hindu
Meal vegetarian or non vegetarian. The food was ok.
The number of toilets for the economy class was too insufficient.
The idea of showing a common movie for all is quite outdated now.

We subsequently travelled by this airline from
Cairo to Abu Simbel,
Abu Simbel to Aswan
Luxor to Cairo
Cairo to Mumbai.

We faced problems in almost all the sectors in the
check in process. It was taking a lot of time.
As you enter , you are required to pass your baggage through security.
Again within a few minutes and in most cases after just a few paces , we
had to pass the baggage through another security check.

"I am going to do my best to be fair - our first flight from Cairo to Luxor was very good; on time, decent service even if the 'business class' lounge is nowhere near of any such class. But overall, the experience was good.

Now, our next flight was from Abu Simbel to Cairo and we were supposed to be in Cairo by 4 pm...in time for a sunset, camel ride at the pyramids or so we naively thought. On arriving at the ABS airport, we were met by an EgyptAir staff member who told us our 2 pm flight was delayed and will definitely , DEFINITELY, take off by 3 pm. He took our tickets (not sure why) and arranged for a car to take us to the Seti hotel. So far, sure these things happen and we found the Seti hotel quite nice although we were given just one drink and a pretty awful lunch.

Just after lunch, there was a flurry of activity and we saw many people grabbing their bags and heading to the airport. On asking an Egyptair staff member, we were told that they will go first and that we 'have been put on a later flight'. Utterly confounded as to why we would be bumped off the flight, we asked to be taken to the airport where we were told by the Station Manager that there was no space for us on the flight. BUT the plane sitting on the tarmac was being repaired and DEFINITELY will take off by 4 pm. DEFINITELY.

This went on to 5 pm, 6 pm. Then told that we should have stayed at the hotel or gone to see the temple like other passengers. At no point did they explain that SEVERAL flights were delayed and that the flight which took off was not ours. That we were not being bumped off and that OUR flight was the one on the tarmac being repaired. The station manager clearly did not grasp how anyone, let alone a woman could question his information and got quite aggressive. We had to call our tour company (who had nothing to do with the airline) and only after they spoke to the airline were we given some decent information.

When asked, they just shrug saying all airlines do this...all airlines have delays. So what.

We understand there are delays, but staff need to communicate sensibly. If there are several flights delayed, they need to have flight numbers displayed at the hotel to tell people which flight is leaving. You don't tell people, you have been put on later flight!

It was a nightmare...stuck in a smoky airport lounge with no fresh air for more than 6 hours. With random reasons being given...some were told delay was due to fog in Cairo! Also, if there are no smoking signals put up, then the senior staff sitting in their rooms and puffing away should just remove these signs. Or go smoke in your homes...don't make your passengers sick.

To finish, if you have an international flight from Cairo/Luxor...make sure you are back in that city a day early. DO NOT depend on EgyptAir to get you there on time and definitely not without your heart/lungs significantly weakened.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellerjourney,Travellerjourney wrote a review Mar 2018,Travellerjourney,"London, United Kingdom",14 contributions,11 helpful votes,Abu Simbel - Cairo,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r564902558-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Really really strange,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Positive points :
1. The take off, landing and the whole flight was the smoothest I have experienced in the recent years .

On board services were fine, meal was quite tasty but it was worth ordering a special meal ie vegetarian as it arrived 30 minutes before everyone else's.  Security was excellent with bags being search several times before as adding the plane.  In flight entertainment was OK if you were sitting in the right seat but unfortunately they were flip down screens from above rather than back of seat screens so I would advise you download some films onto your tablets and watch those instead.  Blankets were provided and regular drinks. Both flights were packed as they were direct flights in/out Luxor and mainly filled with cruise travellers aged 65+.

"I took a flight from Heathrow to Cairo with Egypt air in the huge 777. Lovely plane with tons of leg room. Staff were very chatty and helpful and the inflight entertainment was really good. My only criticism is that the food was pretty terrible and no alcohol is served at all.

"This was our first time we were traveling by EGYPT AIR. We chose this airline as it was our first trip to EGYPT and the air fare we got on the EGYPT AIR website was very reasonable. We had a round trip ticket from NY to Cairo and Medina, Saudi Arabia to NY, with an interim flight from Cairo to Jeddah, also by EGYPT AIR.   The service in general was very poor, with very rude, arrogant and often lazy air stewards who were more in a rush to serve the food and vanish for hours together rather than answer any other needs of the passengers. When we asked if we could get any PEPSI with the food, the steward rudely told us that the only drink he could offer was 7UP, which was fine but the tone of his speech was very disrespectful.    In a span of 3 weeks , we used EGYPT AIR 4 times, and we were very disappointed with the service right from the check-in till the arrival at our destination.  The icing on the cake was when we arrived from Medina to Cairo, enroute to our flight to NY. We had a 10 hour lay over in Cairo and the Customer service at Cairo airport was treating the TRANSIT passengers with total lack of courtesy . They we laughing and joking among themselves. When we asked any questions, they were very rude. When we asked for  hotel accommodation for our overnight stay, it took them more than 2 hours to arrange for a hotel for us and they gave us a poor quality 1-star hotel in Cairo airport. Overall, it was a very disgusting experience with EGYPT AIR all through for myself and my wife during our travel .I would not even give it a 1 star for the level of service we got. we do not recommend this airline to anyone who travels to Egypt or the Middle east. It would be more preferable to pay a little bit more and get a more reputed airline such as EMIRATES or ETIHAD for your travel needs to the Middle East or Egypt from NY.

"My impression og EgyptAir on this flight were that the airline is suffering from a need of new finances. The plane was ple and worn and truly needs a upgrade or renewal right now.

"I was hesitant to book with Egyptair; I often fly with Air Algerie and I thought it would be a similar government-run awful airline. But the tickets were the cheapest and I went for it...I was shocked to find a very new, super-clean plane, with comfortable seats, pillows and blankets provided, and personal TVs in each seat. The staff were courteous and helpful, and even the in-flight food was pretty good. The flights were on-time. We had a 12 hour layover in Cairo, which I expected to be miserable, but we arrived to find that Egyptair would provide us with hotel vouchers for the day, as well as vouchers for a buffet breakfast and lunch, with no additional cost. We even booked a short tour of the pyramids through their company Karnak Tours, who specialize in transit tours, and they took care of the visas for us. It was a very enjoyable experience, and I can say I will definitely be booking with them in the future if the opportunity arises!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleybT3000AR,Ashley B wrote a review Feb 2018,Ashley B,,13 contributions,5 helpful votes,Beirut - Casablanca,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r560404029-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Pleasant Surprise,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me mention that my review doesn't have to do with one trip but with several since I am using this company to travel from Greece to Uganda - my wife's country - and back.
The company doesn't have a bad service at all. They even offer two suitcases per person. Very good! The staff is trained and nice, also the airport in Cairo is neat and interesting.
But, in 50% of their flights there is a big delay, more than half an hour and all of them are unjustified. They do not even bother to announce the reason they delay. I can't forget that last year I was traveling with my old father and getting back from Uganda to Greece the flight in Entebbe airport delayed so much that we had to rush really hard in Cairo to catch up our next flight.
This year's trip also pissed me off because I was traveling with my wife and during check-in in Athens airport they said they couldn't find seats for us to sit together in neither of the two legs of the journey. However in both flights there were seats available. And of course the delays were always there.
Something else, not exactly about Egypt air but connected to it. I don't understand why in Cairo airport when you are transiting you have to be screened twice, once you land and once you depart again. This is only done there. Normally the screening is only done when you depart. This is so frustrating and I am sure it can make people think twice before choosing Cairo for their intermediate stop.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/3b/6f/82/kosmios.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_C1371FE,Αντώνης Σ wrote a review Feb 2018,Αντώνης Σ,"Athens, Greece",75 contributions,40 helpful votes,Athens - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r560047253-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Good service, bad check in, many delays",Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Egyptair; possibly the worst customer service in the World. Appalling check in at London Heathrow Terminal 2, with rude, abrupt staff with little customer service skills, hardly acceptable as the “front face” of the business. We flew business class to Cairo and onwards to Sharm el Sheikh. Unfortunately, there were no business class upgrades available from Cairo to Sharm el Sheikh, so the most uncomfortable and unsafe in flight safety terms flight in economy ensued. I was seated next to a 200kg plus fat man, a man so fat he needed a seat belt extension and he invaded half of my seat. I requested to be moved and was declined. When I pay for a full seat, I expect a full seat whatever the class of travel. This issue although being a very uncomfortable flight, also raises flight safety issues, has there been a requirement to evacuate the aircraft in the event of an emergency this would not have been possible due to this mans size and his inability to move quickly. I raised the issue with the flight purser on departing the aircraft at Sharm and she was totally unhelpful.
Would I fly Egyptair again, definitely no, never.
Would I recommend Egyptair as an airline? Not even to my worst enemy.

"Egypt Air is generally an average airline, the problems I have found with African flights is that the planes are fairly small and prone to be affected by turbulence so maybe uncomfortable at times.
The crew are helpful but generally not cheerful.
Planes are old but fairly well maintained, however occasionally the seas will malfunction (hydraulics) and will not return to upright position.
Meals are good by comparison to most European airlines.
Entertainment systems on African flights are almost non existent, there are some audio channels and a pre-selected movie is played on center screens with no input from passengers.

"The reason this did not get 5 stars is because the check in process and transfer on the ground. I originally flew from Marrakesh and had my boarding passes printed by the hotel (hopefully to save time). Upon getting to the airport, I waited 30 minutes to check baggage and then was told that I would need to have my boarding passes printed by them anyway, and that in Casablanca I would also need to have them printed for the second leg of the trip.  Why? Because I did not have this super-duper-special-tearable paper that they NEED you to have so they can rip off part of it. Then why in the world do you offer the option of printing boarding passes at home?  Anyway, after dealing with the ridiculously long wait to check baggage (I think they were using cellphones instead of computers because the network was down), at least they were able to check my baggage all the way to Cairo - and it ARRIVED!  The transfer in Casablanca was confusing as we had to figure out which desk person was going to print our second boarding passes. At least we had enough time to do that and make it through security.  I was soooo glad. The flight itself was great and the stewards were very, very nice.

"This option is very attractive beacuse it talkes the least amount of elapsed time.  The schedule is not convenient with arrival in Nairoibi at 4am. The fare was cheap at €550 retrun.  The aircraft was old - they even have places to put out cigartettes on the plane!  The food is marginally acceptable and the service adequate, but the crew try hard.

"Okay so lets start at the beginning, Egypt air is not the best airline in the world, I can safely advise you accordingly. However sometimes 2nd best or even 3rd best are not too bad.

I've flown with Egypt air twice now and each and every flight was half full, which means empty seat for all my flights, this is always a bonus and I always board last to keep the agony of sitting there and hoping that you will be lucky (face your fears head on ;) ).

The food on egypt air in my opinion really are top notch, They give you decent portions and will not have issues if you ask for more or extra drink etc...

They are always reasonably priced when you buy a ticket especially to europe. The nice thing about Cairo is that it is only short hop to Europe. Keep in mind that the fly with Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the inflight entertainment dates back to the 90's, the food is still good and flight rarely longer than 4 hours.

Lastly what makes Egypt Air better than lets say Ethiopian and Kenya airways, the answer - Cairo Airport - it is not state of the art, but if you need to kill time I guess this is the best airport to do it at., There is no wifi however Addis claims they have but it seldomly works.

So in a nutshell, Try Egypt Air, it is no Emirates, Qatar or Lufthansa, but really not bad, book that flight if it is cheap and explore.

P.S. I won't pay money for their business class especially given that you will probably fly a 737.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0d/6f/0d/0d/ftroskie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ftroskie,Ftroskie wrote a review Jan 2018,Ftroskie,,23 contributions,9 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Berlin,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r557034533-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Sometimes a cheap alternative......,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"With an all regret and disappointment, I am writing this e-mail to your esteemed company for a major complain that left me all in regret resorting to Egypt Air on my last trip to Germany.
I am a frequent Flyer # MS 4004787286, and a regular loyal customer with a decent flights record on Egypt Air as I appreciate your emphasis on value and excellent service. Yet, a recent episode with one of Egypt Air Officers has happened that made me question my loyalty.

On my way back with my wife from Frankfurt to Cairo, on January 14th 2018 and at the Frankfurt Station, I was inquiring at the gate about the Business boarding with one of your officers as he never bothered to even look at me while talking to him. To make matters worse, I repeated myself - making sure he heard me – Hence, he totally ignored me … and left with a very arrogant way stating he’s going to get back to me which never happened.

Such a disrespectful attitude is not accepted, especially that I am flying with a group of 40 of my top clients to Bangkok via Egypt Air on January 16th 2018. Such a hefty usage shouldn’t be rewarded with a universal disgrace. I hate having my positive feelings about your company ruined by one officer! It is extremely distressing for a loyal, frequent traveler to experience such a poor service despite the politeness of the Station Manager and his assistant.

I urge you to take the necessary action towards Officer Yasser El Rayes at Frankfurt Station, otherwise I will re-consider my upcoming trips on Egypt Air.

Attached herewith my boarding pass.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/73/48/eb/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freddy-younan,Alfred Y wrote a review Jan 2018,Alfred Y,"Giza, Egypt",36 contributions,9 helpful votes,Cairo - Frankfurt,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r556798871-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Unsatisfied Passeger,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Bangkok to Cairo yesterday and wanted to write this review while my trip was still fresh in my mind. First of all, it was not my first time flying Egypt air. I traveled from Alexandria to Hurghada a few years ago and was impressed with the service at that time and I am very pleased to say that my 10 hour flight yesterday was just as impressive. The crew were friendly, accommodating and helpful and the food was surprisingly delicious. The dinner options were chicken or fish. My husband chose the chicken and I selected the fish, so naturally I was able to try both and they were equally tasty. Breakfast wasn’t quite as exciting, but overall it wasn’t bad at all.

"I purchased 2 tickets with Egypt Air from Cairo to Paris return in September and Travel for late December at a cost of 14 120LE. The rules of the ticket were very clear that a FULL REFUND IS PERMITTED if a Visa is denied provided that the embassy letter of denial is sent to the airline; and the cancellation fee on a normal basis I think was 700LE (I do stand to be corrected here, but for sure it wasn’t more than this) So only the one traveller had a Visa refusal, however both tickets needed to be cancelled as we were traveling together. I submitted an online refund and shortly after you receive a Confirmation email of cancellation and an email address to send any supporting documentation, in which I immediately sent the Visa refusal letter to onlinerefund@egyptair.com with reference to my two tickets. However I received only a partial refund, only 12 830LE back!!
A 1 290LE difference...????
I immediately queried this- maybe there was a possibility I didn’t understand something. Also I never read of any extra charges for OnlineRefund’s - EgyptAir is VERY happy to take your money and keep it... so I don’t how they calculated this!! So my fury and utter irritation is the complete lack of customer service, in fact no service whatsoever... you call in but they won’t help because it’s the online department; I have sent email upon email to ask for the breakdown of my refund received (ie. how did you calculate this?), I have facebooked msgd them too and NOTHING since 4December 2017; absolutely useless like their actual aeroplanes and standards on their flights.

"I have used Egypt Air several times and I can tell that their customer service is extremely inconsistent where some attendants are very nice and attentive while others are really rude and lacking proper training. This could even happen on the same plane. During my last flight from Cairo to Toronto there were two female attendants who has never smiled even once while other attendants were really nice and smiling. It was so odd that during the long flight (more than 12 hours) most passengers were really quiet while loud noise was coming from the galley at the back of the plane where attendants were talking to each other very loudly.

A serious matter is when I asked for a cup of hot tea and I was really shocked when the attendant brought the tea in a disposable water cup made out of Polystyrene plastic. When I told the attendant that Polystyrene plastic is not made for hot drinks since the heat makes it carcinogenic, the attendant told me that she KNOWS ABOUT THIS but the company does not provide cups for hot liquids!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamD485,Sam D wrote a review Jan 2018,Sam D,"Toronto, Canada",68 contributions,59 helpful votes,Cairo - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r556203546-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Inconsistent customer service and hazardous handling of hot drinks,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The flight was very smooth and so was the landing. The plane itself was very tired looking and the staff looked miserable. The toilets were less than clean and two of them were out of order.

"I flew Egyptair, Flight MS 668 on the 6 Jan 2018. The leg rooms in the economy class is spacious. The plane itself is not so bad. However, I was pretty disappointed with the service of one particular cabin crew, Ms Sara Ali. I wasn't feeling well when boarding the plane. I was coming down with flu. The air-conditioner was blowing at almost full blast. Right after the Fasten the Seat Belt sign was turned off, I requested for a blanket from Ms Sara, who responded by saying ""I'll check"" which to me was a weird as I saw  another cabin crew on the other side of the isle was distributing some to other passengers. However, she never came back to me. I thought she had forgotten about my request. I asked for the blanket again from Ms Sara after the she had finished serving the lunch which she responded ""OK"". But again nothing happened. I was practically shivering due to the cold temperature & the flu. She passed by me after the captain announced that we would be landing in 30 minutes. I reminded her again about my request. She knew I was upset & she quickly opened the overhead compartment which was located a few seat away from mine & pulled out a fresh blanket.

"The flight to Cairo from JFK (New York) is a great flight alternative to going through Europe when flying to Egypt from the states.  The flights to and from were pretty standard for overseas flights, although it seemed like the seats in Economy class were pretty large.  There was also a fair amount of leg room.  The only issue I had was dehydration.  The attendants did not bring water around very often, or give you anything other than a small cup of water at a time.  These are 10 to 11.5 hour flights, so they need to provide more water.  I had to get up several times and walk to the back and ask for water.

"We went to daytrip from Hurghada to Cairo. Our trip was fixed by Egyptian Excursions Online. So - no any worries. Everything was perfect from the begging to the end of day. Company representative picked up us at hotel reception at 4 am and took us to airport. Domestic part of airport terminal in Hurghada isn't big, but cozy. With possibly to buy not expensive snacks, warm and cold drinks. Both ways - arrival and departure were in time. They serve food (tasty cookies and juice), price is included in flight, even flight was so short! Seats were comfortable, enough space for legs, airlaine crew was very kind and helpful. At airport company guide Ahmed Ali met us, spent whole day with use and in the evening delivered to airport safely. Quick and easy flight back, we were picked at airport again and taken to the hotel reception!

"4 days before departure on my Christmas trip to Kenya I received a cancellation of the flight. Since I had booked the rest of the vacation I had to go and book a new flight. The agent informed med that Egypt Air could not offer an alternative flight so I would receive the full retur of payment within 2-8 week.
The problem was that a new ticket was twice as expensive and cost me more than $1000 extra.
Before booking the new expensive ticket, I tried to contact both the agent and Egypt air for help but help, without any luck.
I also send a complaint to Egypt Air but got the answer that changes happens and they were not responsible for my extra cost. Fact is, that I did not get what I booked and now have an extra cost of $1000 due to the cancellation done by Egypt Air.
I will not book Egypt air again – and I advise you to stay away.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841s_rens,Søren S wrote a review Jan 2018,Søren S,,13 contributions,16 helpful votes,Copenhagen - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r554333906-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Cancelled christmas flight 4 days before departure,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One good thing you can say about this airline is the baggage allowance, although we were nowhere close to our allowance other airlines should take a look at this instead of trying to find ways to rip you off. Flight was fine ( both ways ) in a modern 777 aircraft however staff were not so pleasant and always seemed grumpy ( well the males anyway ) and in a bad mood, if you asked them to do something they just gave you the stare ! I even gave one a small bag of garbage to dispose and he just threw it on the ground an kicked it under the seats ...really !

"We booked a group package and Egypt Air was the recommended airline for our entire trip.
The plane is outdated - our charging ports were broken.
We requested an extra blanket and was told that they don't have any extras.
We had taken 4 flights with them and on all the flights, at least one toilet was broken.
The food is really bad - lots of improvements are needed in this department.
The Air Hostesses are quite old and very rude - not welcoming and definitely not helpful in their responses.

On a positive note, we had a 16 hour layover on our way back home, and Egypt Air did arrange for free transfers, hotel accommodation and visas.
During this layover, one is allowed to travel in Cairo - visit the Pyramids etc.
We waited for about 2 hours at the airport before being transferred to the hotel as the airport team had to get the documentation ready.
The hotel was very nice.
Hotel check in was quick.
The hotel provided free breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Most passengers carried hand luggage for the long layover and those that chose to collect their luggage at Cairo Airport, had to wait till all the necessary formalities were done (2 hours) and then they got to collect their bags - during this time your bag is just going around the carousel - so maybe just take hand luggage and check your main luggage direct to your final destination.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/19/85/4f/experience-editor.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Experience_Editor,Experience Editor wrote a review Jan 2018,Experience Editor,South Africa,135 contributions,162 helpful votes,Cairo - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r553878816-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Outdated,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I try to avoid Egypt air as much as I can, but sometimes for business trips it’s the only viable alternative. Every flight is a disaster. The planes are out of 1950s with gold buckles and uncomfortable seats. The food is bad, and the staff is not great to say the least.
During one red eye flight I kept waking up because I was smelling smoke. I told the flight attendant, thinking someone is smoking in the bathroom. I was assured that they checked, no one is smoking and it’s all in my head. Then another person in business class complained of smoke. Turns out, EGYPT AIR ALLOWS THE PERSONNEL TO SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT !!! Wtf?! Not only is it a serious hazard, but it also stinks up the whole plane, and particularly business class.
Another time while boarding, I watched the flight attendant help a passenger put his bag in the overhead bin right above my seat. It was the last available space in business class, and the passenger then walked to the back of economy. The same flight attendant then told me I have to either check my bag (with computer and valuables inside), or put it rows and rows behind me in economy. When I suggested he takes the economy bag back and stores it next to the passenger who it belongs to, he told me that all the bags there belonged to the business class passengers, and refused to budge. Other passengers were also flabbergasted, and they observed the same situation, and finally the purser resolved it.

I recommend Egyptair as one of the best airlines ,especially after what I've been seeing other passengers of different Airlines didn't get any immediate compensation.Egyptair professionally handled that problem, Thanks:)

"We had two legs of travel with Egyptair. The first from Toronto to Cairo, the next from Cairo to Bangkok. The first leg was a 10 plus hour flight, so business class made it a more comfortable trip. Everything was excellent, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. The seats fully reclined and there was lots of room. The aircraft was a 777. The food presented was very good, fresh and not stodgy. We didn't have any complaints at all.I will write about our 17 hour layover in Cairo after first describing the next leg of the flight. We departed Cairo very late evening with  9 plus hour flight to Bangkok. The aircraft used this time was an Airbus 320- 200 series. It was less roomy, the seats didn't fully recline ,  in fact my seat, the leg portion was not working properly so my legs were never quite elevated enough to afford a comfortable position. The food for some reason wasn't as good either and halfway through the flight one of the washrooms stopped working so 30+ people had to use just the forward toilet.  However, again I couldn't complain about the staff for they were as friendly and accommodating as the first leg. I think that aircraft needs to be retired, or used on short haul flights only., it has seen better days. Please note that Egyptair, because it is based in a Muslim nation, offers no alcohol on board. I like my glass of wine with dinner, but I didn't miss it at all.Because our layover was so long we had a complimentary hotel room and meals at the Meridian Hotel attached to the airport. This was great, as we could shower, change and relax in between. We were met at the Cairo airport, at the in transit area for passengers staying longer than 6 hours. (The airport itself is chaotic and there is no order to anything. Queues form where people are trying walk through, the signage is not clear and everyone is pushing and cutting into line. But that's just Egypt, and you accept it. After queuing up in the wrong line 3 times we finally got to the right place. At this point the fabulous representative from Egyptairs tour arm took charge and told us our options for the day. If you are in transit in  Egypt and you stay in the hotel they offer and don't leave you  don't need to pay for a  visa. However if you wish you can book a tour (for a cost of course) and purchase a visa in the airport for $25.00 U.S. We have been to Egypt before, but we decided to check out the pyramids again. We booked a 4 hour tour which still gave us plenty of time to relax. The representative helped us get the visa purchased, facilitated a quick exit out of the airport and to the hotel.  A few hours later a driver picked us up at the hotel and we had a tour of the pyramids and Sphinx with a guide we picked up on the way. It was casual but perfect for us. Of course there is always the ubiquitous stop at a shop, but this one was very good. It was an essential oil shop and we rather enjoyed it. Our guide didn't force anything, he was very good and asked permission to stop.  We could have extended the day further but traffic was becoming shocking and we were still a bit tired so we returned to the hotel for a lovely buffet dinner and then returned to the airport for our flight.I wouldn't be honest if I didn't state that for those who are looking for upgraded amenities, quality wines and liqueurs,  and other things may be disappointed in Egyptair but we found it to be ,  for the most part a good experience.Just a side note, the Business class lounges in Cairo (there are several ) are not up to much. We checked out 4 and found the one in Section F to be the cleanest,  most well stocked. The first one we went in lacked both cleanliness and comfort, we left quickly. We found the better one must near our departure gate and enjoyed the atmosphere there much more.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xiamenwecl,Xiamenwecl wrote a review Jan 2018,Xiamenwecl,"Niagara Falls, Canada",8 contributions,24 helpful votes,Toronto - Bangkok,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r552424258-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Egyptair business class experience,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Took several flights on this trip with Egypt Air. Flight Attendants didn’t seem to want to be there.....they barely make eye contact with passengers so they don’t get asked anything.....I waited almost 15 minutes for the flight attendant to respond to the buzzer so I can ask for water to take my meds and in overseas flight you’d think you don’t need to beg for water and when she finally showed up, she brought me juice instead! food was disgusting and I was due to flight delay and no place in where were left like prisoners to eat! As soon as we arrived I left as soon as I can and unfortunately, being sleep deprived and hungry, I left my reading glasses on my seat....went back to the airport 3 times to try and locate them....that was a joke, they told they’d check and call me, no one ever calls back and one person direct you to another...the airline says not our responsibility check with security and security tells me the airline should look after that....nonetheless, I lost my $600 glasses...pricy trip, this ended be and awaful customer service",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91amala,91amala wrote a review Jan 2018,91amala,"Richmond Hill, Canada",192 contributions,88 helpful votes,Toronto - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r552313420-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Service getting worse,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had a good experience on the way from Aswan to Abu Simbel, and the return flight.  We sat in business class and were fortunate to sit beside the Egyptian Governor of Aswan Governorate.  Once we arrived at Abu Simbel, business class deplaned first.  My friend and I followed the governor to the VIP shuttle while the rest of the plane waited for another shuttle to arrive, it was one of the best flight experiences I’ve had traveling in a foreign country.  However, we also experienced flight rescheduling a couple of times at the start, which really disrupts our travel itinerary and we had to move things around to accommodate our transportation needs.  The Egyptair website and online support needs some upgrading, as the website will not take Star Alliance frequent flyer numbers, even though there is a field for the number.

"We had a dreadful experience at Cairo Airport. After getting through security with my 84-year-old blind mother, finally getting to the ticket counter with our itinerary in hand including our flight booking, we were told we were not on the flight. Instead, Egypt Air had apparently transferred us to Nile Air which was in a different terminal. We had not been informed of the change nor had our tour company which arranged the flight been informed. We had to struggle with our luggage, no wheelchair, backwards through security (not an easy feat), try to find help to get to Terminal 1, got through Security there and to the baggage counter only to be told we were 10 minutes late for the flight they had transferred us to on Nile Air ... and there was no other flight that day. Our tour company then rebooked us on a later Egypt Air flight so we had to get back through security at Nile Air terminal, into a filthy taxi with a broken windscreen to get back to the Egypt Air terminal, struggle through security again, then the ticket counter and finally made a flight but were too late arriving in Luxor to meet up with our organized tour for the day. A horrible morning, no assistance from Egypt Air, no apology ... awful. we had to fly Egypt Air three more times during out tour of Egypt. The good was that when we did have a wheelchair, the airline arranged for elevator life into the aircraft for my mother -- so much easier than the climb up and down the stairs. They were great about this on all the follow-on flights. The flights were all very short so no meal service but there was always an offer of a drink and snack cookies. Overall my advice to travellers would be to continue to contact the airline in advance of their flight to make sure they had not been transferred to another airline at their convenience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S837ISrita,S837ISrita wrote a review Jan 2018,S837ISrita,,8 contributions,4 helpful votes,Cairo - Luxor,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r550779244-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good and Bad,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We have travelled a lot and have flown with many airlines. Bit have never had such fantastic service as we got from Egypt Air. There was a 3 hour delay on our way from Cairo to Tel Aviv. They gave us breakfast and made sure we could contact the hotel to arrange a different time for pick up. We knew about their policy for free hotel accommodation if you have a long stop over in Cairo. We told them that we wished we could rather have a tour of Egypt on our way back but we have no visums. Well they made our dream come true. We just landed and Cairo when they called us that we must bring our passports they made a plan for all 7 of us. They gave a guide and with 13 other people they took us out and stopped at the Nile River. We got a tour of the pyramids and the sphinx. We drove through the streets of Cairo and to top it all off they even stopped at a perfume oil shop and showed us how paper was made and our names were written in hieroglyphics. Then we had a lovely traditional Egyptian dinner before heading back to the airport.

"I’ve flown with Egypt Air numerous times, but it never seems to change. The service is consistently terrible on all its flights, but especially so on long haul flights. It has the pricing of a “regular” airline, but the quality of a very basic, low-cost carrier. The flight attendants treat passengers with a mixture of contempt and neglect. Asking for a glass of water will earn you a glare, a look of disgust and the flight attendant will make sure you wait a few hours till you are almost faint with dehydration. On most of the flights I’ve been on, the flight attendants rarely had more than a rudimentary knowledge of English, a word or two of French, and even their Arabic (supposedly their mother tongue) was poor! I would say the only advantage to flying with Egypt Air is that they have a very generous luggage allowance, around 46 kgs on longer flights.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LubnaH499,Lubna H wrote a review Dec 2017,Lubna H,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",25 contributions,62 helpful votes,Cairo - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r546488167-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Very poor service,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We chose an aisle and an aisle in the middle group and, both ways, had no-one in the middle seat so we had more room. Neither plane was full. Tourism in Egypt is down 80% although we felt perfectly safe for our 10 days there. The food from Toronto to Cairo was good but the breakfast coming back wasn't the best. The movies are ones you've likely never heard of and they're the same in both directions. It was 10 hours and 40 minutes going and 11 1/2 hours coming back.

"I booked Egyptair flight MS 778 on 20 November 2017 from London Heathrow to Cairo International airport.
The good point about choosing this airline was the non-stop flight between the two airports.
British Airway is a direct flight too but was fully booked for my return date.
The flight departure was delayed for over half an hour. The apologetic public announcement referred the delay due to the late arrival of the plane from Cairo.

The leg room was uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment was limited. The food was tasteless and the staff uniform was poor.
The staff was polite but they did the job mechanically without interest.
The captain announcements were limited and lacked humour.

The flight itself went on smoothly and the luggage arrived intact but had to wait almost 45 minutes to get it.
Going through immigration was very crowded and cuticle.
The whole experience was boring and the fare was expensive.

The biggest reason for ranking this an average is that its in-flight crew behave weirdly when asked for anything extra. I heard the stewards denying passengers any extra meals and then saw them sit at the back of the aircraft with large numbers of full meals, cherry picking things they wanted to eat from multiple food trays and even pack some of these items to take home with them!
Surely the airline pays them well enough not to indulge in this kind of petty behaviour.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yassirbom,yassirbom wrote a review Dec 2017,yassirbom,"Mumbai, India",95 contributions,68 helpful votes,Mumbai - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r545425959-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Good airline, average in-flight staff",Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight was fine, on time and the food was very generous for a one hour flight. Both my husband and our friend are very tall, long legs but that wasn't a problem for the seats on economy as there was adequate room. Service was good, cheerful and very efficient. The big plus for us is the two suitcase allowance, even on that one hour flight and we will be flying Egyptair again to Portugal next week as the baggage allowance is greater. The food is always reasonably good with generous portions but they don't serve alcohol. The business class lounges in Cairo are very poor though, compared to other countries but what little they offer is fresh. Overall, we have had far worse experiences with airlines that used to be great and now don't even offer a baggage allowance.

"I traveled with Egypt Air from Paris to Baghdad, via Cairo(about 10 hour transit) on 31/7/2017.  It was one of the worst trips I have made and am still regretting my decision to travel with them. Let me start by the unfriendliness and very bad manners of the staff both at the Paris booking office and at CDG airport. The flight itself was nothing out of the ordinary: simple meal, not enough blankets , noisy and unruly passengers ...   all that was to be expected and tolerable , if it wasn't for the great damage my luggage suffered at the hands of  Egypt Air ! A damage I've never seen before , it even looked  deliberate . My bags were damaged beyond repair, and it wasn't the scratches that passengers normally end up with after flights . One of them had both handles completely smashed , as if someone smashed the bag on the ground several times. Another one had a very big dent ! A sac that i was forced to buy at CDG by  Egypt Air staff (to decrease the weight of a bag) was completely torn and taped together !!!  I was , and still am , very angry, when i saw the massacre of my luggage. I reported it but had no response , when i did it again the answer  was : "" you should have reported it earlier"". I strongly advise my fellow travelers to think twice and look for other options before booking on Egypt Air.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/7d/db/16/camille1972.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camille1972,camille1972 wrote a review Dec 2017,camille1972,"Paris, France",9 contributions,2 helpful votes,Paris - Baghdad,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r545196421-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Bad airlines.,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"i am doing this flight monthly ... i tried other airlines too
nothing much to say ; the aircraft has a funny smell but the seats are ok but old of course
the crew are friendly (mostly male crew are not female ) but grooming wise i note them 0\10
the safety video omg i think its 60 y o
they need to compromise more on the safety and security i have many comments regarding that
otherwise i gave them average because i spend most of my flight reading or working
and the vibes are good ...
i have requested once for a gluten free meal and after this crew throwing the regular tray on my table ! she had no clue what gluten free is
i was left without food until almost top of descent so i looked for the supervisor and he apologized deeply ; he offered me a salmon meal from business class and a cup of tea but i couldn't have it because i already felt offended and left behind ...

"really cant fault the service. We were offerd free newspapers and head sets. There was a film to watch and a meal provided. The food was as good as any other flight I have been on and they came round offering drinks on several occasions. please note as this is a Muslim airline there is no alcohol and after the safety video there is a short prayer video.
My only complaint was that the plain itself was quite old and very small. We got extra legroom seats so no problem there but the seats were very narrow as well. There is a first class that looked like the regular premium economy you get on other airlines. The seats were leather and wider ( two across instead of three} And you had your own screen in the back of the seat. To book this in the uk was very expensive around £800 each. We emails Egypt air from Luxor and the price had fallen to 600 each. We asked again at the airport and the price had fallen yet again to 200 each, worth bearing in mind if you fancy an upgrade.

"Travel by scheduled flight certainly beats package trip. For the price you get meal and baggage, plus more leg room. Also if put together with hotel booking by your travel agent, it gets you the atoll protection you will not get if you book all bits of holiday separately. This trip involves a change of planes in Cairo, but no reply al trouble except a fairly long walk between gates. Egyptair officials at Cairo also well aware of the transfer, and geared up to ensure no passenger or luggage missed the connection. One minor irritation, and cost. Because you are ( obviously) arriving in Egypt when you get to Cairo, you have to buy an entry visa, whereas if you had arrived direct in Sharm el Sheikh you don't need one for stay in immediate vicinity. The transfer between flights is not considered to be external to the country. However  Plus side is you arrive as an internal traveller at Sharm el Sheikh so formalities are minimal and swift.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antonys833,Antony S wrote a review Dec 2017,Antony S,"Chard, United Kingdom",15 contributions,21 helpful votes,London - Sharm El Sheikh,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r544988619-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Civilised way to travel,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown on Egypt Air a few times now, and have continued to be impressed by the friendly, professional on-board service and fantastic landings.  The food is acceptable as airline food goes, but to be honest, I have had better on a few other airlines.There seems to be more leg room between the seats, which certainly helps on long flights.The Arabic incantations at the beginning of the flight were a little annoying, but I used the time as a reminder to pray as well. :-)The only real issue that I have with Egypt Air is their 'hub' airport of Cairo.  It has been an unpleasant experience every time (even just in transit) so unpleasant, and is seriously making me reconsider traveling Egypt Air again.  (And listening to the murmurings of fellow passengers, I am not the only one considering this).  * The airport staff do not contribute to a pleasant trip.  (Perhaps being frowned at by everyone is a standard employee expression towards travelers?)*  Lack of adequate signage makes finding the international departures very difficult. (It is tucked away in a corner, behind some service desks).*  The chaotic system that the airport has in place to pass international travelers through security is really not in any way pleasant.   *  The first of the two careful and thorough security checks is most unpleasant and certainly below the standard of what one would expect from an international airport, which handles the large number of international travelers that this airport does.  *  There is only one security scanner and this security check point is tucked into a tiny hall space in front of the lifts and stairwell.  Due to the inadequacy of the area and equipment, the staff try to rush things and end up damaging passenger's hand luggage items when they search through.  (I had purchased mobile phone camera lenses for my sons for Christmas, and components went flying when the official ripped (yes ripped - he didn't even try and open the box carefully or gently) open one of the boxes. This was done, after he'd asked me what it was and I'd explained, I also pointed out that it was clearly indicated on the box which was still sealed, and offered to open the box for him.    It was a scramble trying to prevent more damage, as I tried to pick up pieces off the floor before they were trampled!  It is just plainly chaotic and while one appreciates the need for the security checks in today's climate, at least the check could be done professionally.  The second security check  on the 2nd floor (also before you enter the international departure area) had 2 scanners, and polite, professional officials.  *  One must also note that Cairo Airport does not accept binoculars packed into your hand luggage - even though there is no prior warning,of binoculars being a non allowed item, on any website.  (In fact the sign indicating banned items, right at the security scanners, stipulates binoculars with cameras are not allowed on board - but the officials confiscate all binoculars).  Egypt Air is certainly not  going to benefit due the unpleasant travel experience at Cairo Airport.  A pity, as I have enjoyed the flying with them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/1e/ea/1c/4us2enjoy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4us2enjoy,4us2enjoy wrote a review Dec 2017,4us2enjoy,"Beira, Mozambique",185 contributions,108 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r544987293-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Great flight experience, but certainly let down by Cairo Airport",Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sunday the 26th of November, at 12:50am, on my return flight from Bangkok to Lagos, the Egypt Air plane developed a faulty just when the pilot was accelerating for take off. He heard a loud sound and the plane suddenly decelerated. The flight was cancelled. For the next 4 hours we were in limbo not knowing what exactly happened apart from the ""technical difficulty"". Credit to Egypt Air for feeding and eventually accommodating us at Ambassador hotel around 7am.

My wife and I eventually go assigned an Emirates flight from Bangkok to Dubai at 8:30pm, before being ferried by Egypt Air from Dubai to Cairo and Cairo to Lagos. I came back home needing another holiday.

This was the real cost to buying a cheap ticket. On my way to Bangkok from Lagos via Cairo, none of the planes had personal entertainment. From Dubai to Cairo and Cairo to Lagos, same boring flight. The most pleasurable part of the trip was on the Bangkok to Dubai leg on Emirates. It was like breathing fresh air after wading through smog. Worse case, internet service aboard Egypt Air was $15 for 13mb of data. That's gotta be the most expensive data in the world.

The food on the flights weren't too bad, but far from the quality and presentation other airlines give.

Will I fly Egypt air again? Dunno... But sure the health of their planes will be a major consideration for me before attempting to.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/567reginaldb,Reginald B wrote a review Dec 2017,Reginald B,,24 contributions,2 helpful votes,Bangkok - Lagos,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r544983347-EGYPTAIR-World.html,UNPLEASANT TRAVEL EXPERIENCE WITH EGYPT AIR,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled with my husband and we booked business class flights on all 3 legs of the internal flights in Egypt - Cairo to Abu Simbel, Abu Simbel to Aswan and Luxor to Cairo. The planes that are used are very small and there is really no difference between business class and economy class in relation to the seating. We were offered drinks in plastic cups. The meals/snacks were very disappointing. Poor quality ingredients. The bread was dry and just had a piece of dry cheese on it. I wonder what the passengers in economy class received.if we got what we did. At least the chocolate cake on the flight from Luxor was tasty and fresh. There is only a business class lounge in Cairo.

"We were a little unsure about taking Egypt Air for the long haul portion of our trip.   We were considering a hop through Europe.  However the price with Egypt Air US$550 was too good to turn down.

"The great advantage of flying Egyptair between New York and Cairo is that you can get a direct, non-stop flight, without having to change planes in some nightmarish European airport like Frankfurt-am-Main.  Also, the comfort level on these long-distance flights is considerably greater than on the connecting Europe to Cairo flights on most other airlines.  Another advantage is that the flights leave and arrive at decent hours at both ends.  Check-in at Kennedy as well as in Cairo can be a bit chaotic, but the service on board is fine, the business-class seating comfortable, and the food is good.Although alcohol is served on many other airlines operated by predominantly-Islamic countries, such as the UAE's Emirates Airline, no alcohol is served on Egyptair.  But. if you find it impossible to fly without the aid of strong drink, then stop at a duty-free shop and pick up a few mini bottles on the way to the gate.

Only problem was when we arrived in Cairo on the outward journey we were charged $20 each at immigration when there is no charge if you fly direct ( not available from UK ) into Sharm.So, $40 to wait in Cairo airport for an hour or so!!

"1st of all when they scanned my ticket it doesn't scanned properly so they kept me on a side with other passengers as well, after 10 minutes they allow me in as the last passenger ! inside i was facing the problem that there is no place for my Cabin bag, the air hostess claimed that my bag is not a cabin bag, i'm a frequent traveler and my Cabin bag is even less than the standard size for a Cabin bag, after some negotiations they handed in to the business class,
the 2nd disappointment is the cleanliness of the seats, obviously not cleaned after the previous flight plus most of passengers was awfully smelly.
The 3rd was the food, not delicious and lack of option, just chicken, moreover i saw an air hostess handling his colleague a piece of bread by hi bare hand, it went to the ground so he picked it up also bare hand to the passenger ! so from a hand,to the ground, to another hand !

My flight from Cairo to Bangkok had may employees in business and family members. It took over 45 minutes after take off to serve a glass of water. Service is poor and food is really standard. Compared to an economy class in other carriers.

Cairo Lounge completely outdated, dirty (main room and restrooms) and food not at a high standard, no showers and limited variety of options to drink and to eat. Employees dining at the lounge. I ate at burger king... because it seemed cleaner.

"We paid extra for an International Airline as opposed to a budget one as we had a 5hour flight with 4 children travelling with us. We hoped that the aircraft would be an up to date one with broader walkways and up to date entertainment.

Just before boarding our gate we were told that we need to go to a different gate number as the aircraft is waiting there. We arrived at our gate and boarded our flight to realise that the aircraft was a early 1990s one with no entertainment and a seat setting of 2 by 2. It was a small aircraft, tight and cramped something that should be used for domestic flights not 5 hour international flights.

There was no apologies from captain or staff or any explanation as to why we were all cramped up in the dated aircraft just a vague explanation of safety and then up in the air.

The children drove us crazy as 2 of them had to sit alone due to the seating arrangements.

"Recently flew on 4 Business Class flights in the past month.  Chose Egyptair on the good value of the Business class fare to get to my destination, which was half the price of other airlines.  Because of the long flying distance, I was mostly looking for the seat space and flat seat.  The Business Class seat on the long-haul flight was overall rather spacious and could lay down to sleep, so this was good.  However, their entertainment system was extremely limited, cabin cleanliness could be improved, onboard service mediocre and not friendly, and onboard food very basic.  Cairo airport is very smokey from cigarette smoking airport employees, despite the no smoking signs.  So it's not a pleasant environment to be in for a non-smoking traveller, and the people work very slowly and inefficient.  The Cairo business lounges are very basic with very few amenities, so not worth getting to the airport early to enjoy.  The access to the Business lounges in the other international countries outside of Egypt have much higher standards and are true Business class lounges.  I flew not expecting much in terms of service and amenities, and that's what I received.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/22/db/b9/gbear04.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gbear04,gbear04 wrote a review Nov 2017,gbear04,"Toronto, Canada",52 contributions,59 helpful votes,Dubai - Toronto,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r540789535-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Good value, but not known for great quality or service",Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight 23.10.17 Heathrow - Luxor
On check in we made sure that the seats were where allocated where what we were happy with so we could change them if need be. We were happy. One of us is a nervous flyer and needs to be seated next to a window so we can see everything happening outside. When we got on the plane we were told in no uncertain terms that they had changed our seats because a mother and son were sat across an aisle and they weren’t happy with that. I’m not unsympathetic but surely if you’re travelling alone with a child you would rectify this at check in like we did with the nervous flyer? We refused and the air hostess tried making me feel guilty by reiterating it was a mother and son. Again we refused and told them we had ensured we were happy with our seats at check in and wouldn’t change. We were then told we could have our seats but would have to leave our hand luggage in business class and were not allowed to come back for anything out of it. Again I told her this was unacceptable because my inhalers and other items I would need in flight were in there. Again the hostess disappeared and eventually came back ad told me we could if we needed to. The one time I went through for something I was ushered out quickly by the host on that cabin. The food by the way was appalling.

Flight 04.11.17 Hurghada – Cairo
We were business class on this flight which I s different world from economy but due to the early time were up I wanted to get a little sleep. No chance. No sooner than you were up they whipped the table out in front of you and started service you a cardboard breakfast and by the time they were done it was time to descend. Generally a good flight but the prayer on the screen prior to take off is disconcerting.

Flight 06.11.17 Cairo – Heathrow
We checked our seats and were seated happy with our allocation. Much better plane, we were able to watch a film with the screen on the seat back. When the food came around we opted for chicken because we don’t eat red meat. The smarmy male host wet to see if there was any left because we were in seats 40 and came back and told us they only had beef because we are at the back. The man in the middle seats though who was Egyptian was allowed chicken even though he was asked after us. Preferential treatment me thinks? So we got the beef and just ate the veg which was vile and the bread roll. He then came around with coffee and I got half a cup, no apology just “ah it’s because you’re last again” and then he was gone. After that he went around with tea. Not acceptable service. I kept asking for water because I get really thirsty during the flight and the water I purchased in duty free to get on the plane with was taken off me at the gate (crazy when bought in the airport for the flight). I swear the hostess hated me because he would only give me half a plastic cup each time and filled everyone else’s.

I would not recommend Egyptair to anyone.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venusbell,venusbell wrote a review Nov 2017,venusbell,"Rothwell, United Kingdom",132 contributions,113 helpful votes,London - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r540590924-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Rude staff, vile food & terrible service",Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Today I finished my first travel with Egypt air... and would like to share with you a few comments.

Flight MUC X CAI X BKK

Munich x Cairo... new airplane... but service SOOO SLOW!!! It took 1 hour for them to pass even with water. I don't mind not having glass... but did you see the quality of the plastic cup?!?!? and One cup per person!

The service is very slow and food is average. The staff was nice, but slow.

Lounge experience at the airport in Cairo: NEVER NEVER NEVER!!! The lounge is dirty! yes... DIRTY!!! The restrooms are disgusting and I went to 3 different ones. Food... I saw more employees eating the food than clients. food appearance horrible... and I did not even taste.

Lack of information for the gate... i was informed to check at 22:40 and I decided to check early... at 22:20 they were calling last call! LAST CALL!!!

Last... A330 CAI X BKK
Dirty, outdated, uncomfortable... and this time I decided to check... THE FIRST SERVICE... was after 1 hour and 30 minutes! Many clients were sleeping! Seriously?!? What service is that?

And to close... I arrived and my luggage was broken! Yes... Broken! Oohhh and airport staff said that someone from the company will call me in 2 WEEKS!!!

2 WEEKS?!

"Having arrived at Hurgharda airport early to avoid rushing around I put my bag on the system first and asked 'will they be transferred to our Heathrow flight from Cairo?' 'Yes no problem' I was told......
When we arrived at Cairo international I watched as one of our bags was THROWN onto the waiting luggage cart and I mean thrown! The cart literally bounced, now as we had been on a diving holiday and some of our expensive kit was in these bags I was horrified!
The trouble didn't stop there, after arriving at Heathrow and waiting nearly an hour I found that My bag the first one of 5 that was put onto the system hadn't made the same flight as I had but the other 4 had, how can in a modern airport with scanning equipment a bag that is labelled Heathrow not make the same flight as 4 other bags that funny enough all have the same thing on them?
When I went to baggage lost and found and reported it they couldn't even find the tag on their system!! And again I ask how can a piece of luggage that has a bar code for LONDON NOT make the flight?
I am now still awaiting a response and a we have found your luggage.... I am now loosing money as I am a diving instructor and the kit I need to teach is lost somewhere in the Egypt air system!!!!

On our trip back to Toronto we had 13 hours overlay at Cairo airport. and they said that since the overlay is more than 6 hours Egypt air provided us with accommodation inside the airport, it was more like detention centre with no water, very dirty room with broken bed with blankets full of hair and smells like urine.
we could not use the room and we spend the 13 hours siting in the transit terminal, which did not have any resultant, the Egypt air provided us with lunch which was plane food left overs and cold small bread and bottle of water.
The flight was delayed by one hour. at that stage we were so tried. the flight from Cairo to Toronto was acceptable comparing to what we have been through in the transit terminal.
We asked Egypt air in Toronto about our bag and we showed the report and the representative said that he can not track it and he gave us a number that no one can reach, and when i called the main office they gave me different number but again no one answer the phone number and no mail box to leave a message,

"This is by far the worst trans-atlantic flight I have taken in Business class.Given that this is a dry airline (which I feel should be more prominently displayed on their website) I expected the service and experience to be top notch.  It was anything but.  In fact ghetto is a word I would use.  Especially compared to Air Canada business class.  Here are the major disappointing highlights.  And trust me I don't often write such bad reviews.  This is deserving:- check-in is passe with a paper envelop for your ticket and other unnecessary paper.  -The seats are NOT lie flat-no drinks were offered until lunch was served.  (Air Canada has likely done 3 runs with the drink cart by this time)-I asked for extra cheese with lunch - and was told no-Drink options:  Pepsi, tonic water, orange & some other juice, coffee & Tea.  Don't think soda water is a hard request...-when I asked for more water I was told I had a bottle at my seat and not given more-Flight attendants barely serviced the floor. I got up numerous times to ask for more water and was at one point to do it myself as she was busy putting lip liner on.-no snacks were available.  After 5 hrs I was hungry - this was a HUGE inconvenience to them.  I have NEVER flown and been hungry and not been able to have a snack.-TV's are very far from where you actually sit - so if your vision isn't 20/20 - forget about it. And POOR selection of entertainment.-amenity kit had: socks, toothbrush, eye mask.  No ear plugs, hand moisturizer,  lip balm-Pillow was flat and the pillow case was pilled.  Blanket likely came from the dollar store - felt? again terrible material-bathrooms: small and again only hand soap - on a 10 hr flight your hands get dry....it would just be nicePoor service, poor food, poor non-alcoholic drink options and overall totally dated plane.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liketotraveltoronto,liketotraveltoronto wrote a review Sep 2017,liketotraveltoronto,"Toronto, Canada",74 contributions,82 helpful votes,Toronto - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r524097059-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Terribly Disappointing Airline and overall experience,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I do not like when I end up on the airbus A320.  There are no individual entertainmemt screens which makes it very dificult when travelling with small children. Be advised during slower seasons they switch out the 777 for the A320.  Food is just as good as any airliner.  Entertainment is decent.

"Despite being shown as 'on time' consistently from two hours before scheduled departure, the flight was an hour late departing. The only information received was an announcement on board that the flight was 'delayed due to boarding passengers'. Well, you can hardly blame them for that then, that doesn't normally happen!

So, having transferred from another Egyptair flight several hours previously we had eaten nothing for seven hours, expecting as usual to receive something on board (the Egyptair 'business lounge' offered nothing remotely appetizing, mostly appearing to have been on display for a considerable time, and not replenished). Sadly the first meal offered was breakfast another seven hours later. The only choice available was between two identical looking omelettes, which despite not being a big fan I had to try.

"Had there been other alternatives I would have taken them. This was my second flight with this airline and they don't improve. Boarding was late and chaotic so the pushy make their way to the front and are allowed through, fill the overhead bins and plonk themselves in seats. At Sharm El Sheikh Airport you are told to be there for additional security checks at least 2 hours before departure. One hour is plenty enough. Rude individuals will keep you from getting near departures, it will suddenly be announced and a scrum will ensue. Cairo Airport is not much fun either. One scanner will say you can't have something in hand luggage but it isn't on any list. Insist on the supervisor being called and he will soon back down. On to the next one - and a further three - all of whom say you can't have a different item. By the time you are through you're very cross.

Screaming infants are placed throughout the aircraft so they cannot be avoided at all. Food awful. Entertainment worse. Do I want to spend a few hours watching some badly acted Egyptian soap opera?

"Going on holiday in Cairo, and onwards to Hurghada, we took a 5½ hours flight in a fairly old but ok and clean cabin. We had checked in online, and it worked out fine. The seats are like other flight companies, neither super comfortable nor horrible, but average and fair enough for the flight duration. On board meals were quite tasty and you had 2 choices of a warm meal. No alcohol is served on board. For the price we paid we cannot but recommend Egypt air.

"I live in Cairo Egypt, I find that Egyptair is the most convenient air carrier.
First, humane departure times from Cairo, mostly between 9 & 10 am (versus other airline departure times of 1 & 4 am), meaning that you reach the airport after a good sufficient night sleep, arrive to your destination 4-5 hours later in due check in time in your hotel (versus arriving too early after a sleepless night to wait in a hotel lobby till your room is ready).
Second very convenient departure times from you destination mostly between 2 & 4 pm meaning a good night sleep, enough time for a relaxed breakfast, checking out at leisure & reaching the airport relaxed.

"Very comfortable flight with individual TV sets which was fab for our 2 children ( their too small to see the normal ones )
Our flight was delayed by 2 & 1/2 hours which was a pain, they said our connecting flight from Cairo to Luxor would wait but it did not ! So we were stuck in Cairo over night and all the next day ! They did put us up in a hotel with food included but no drinks except water, soft drinks would have been nice but we had to pay for them.
As we have outer own appt in Luxor paying for hotel soft drinks did cost more than would have done in our own place ( 3 adults and 2 children )
The airline staff friendly, we use Egyptair a lot over the years.
We got a good price this time as booked almost a year in advance but they now are very expensive if not. More people would go to Egypt if the prices were more reasonable (last year it cost over £600 per person !
Meals also very good,
Will use again as normally very good and not normally delayed, but hope they do direct to Luxor again !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionao708,Fiona O wrote a review Aug 2017,Fiona O,"Lowestoft, United Kingdom",22 contributions,12 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r519004114-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Comfortable flight,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My experience with EgyptAir, the first time ever, was a great one! The stewards were very friendly and helpful. The plane was clean and the service was very good. I particularly enjoyed the deserts and the salads, as these can be neglected easily, but not on EgyptAir.
I booked the seats behind the toilets in the middle of the plane and there was so much space. I recommend these seats if you have an issue with leg space.
The staff at Cairo airport were slightly on the moody side, but so were the staff at Paris airport, so I would not say that Cairo was unique.

There is wifi on the flight, but limited to 15 minutes only at Cairo airport.

Can I just add, that arriving back in SA is always such an amazing experience - as we have the friendliest staff in the world!!!

"I fly twice a year, My comparison will be limited to the airlines are used previously to make it fair (Lufthansa - Nordic Airlines - British Airlines - Austrian Airlines - Egypt Air).
-Egypt air pilots were the 2nd best out of the 5, landing, take off and flights are usually smooth.
-Food on the plane was not delicious but edible, usually, you choose between chicken, beef or fish, definitely better than Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines but British Airways and Nordic are the best.
-Service is firm but do not expect more than that, not bad though, you will get what you as for but nothing extra.
- seats are ok but could get uncomfortable on 8+ hours flights. but thats in most airlines. just take a walk every few hours.
- Luggage, the best in all of them. usually 2 bags and a carry on while most other airlines allow just 1 bag and a carry-on. in some cases (like holding a CIB platinum credit card or a gold Egypt air card) you even get an extra bag for free.
- Rarely have I experienced delays with Egypt air, if it does happen, it's not more than 30 min max.
- Most of the planes don't have wifi but most of them have screens, movies, and entertainment.

"I took a flight from Heathrow to Cairo on EGYPTAIR. Generally the flight was nice and quick. The flight was delayed minutes to takeoff yet we arrived right on time. The seats were comfortable especially with great leg room under the front seat (don't store stuff there). The onboard entertainment wasn't the best yet there was a great variety of movies to watch. The food was perfect! I recommend you order the seafood meal (This has to be ordered online at least 2 days before the flight). The only downside to the flight was the crew service which at times they showed annoyance with people's requests of food and water.

"The only nice thing about flying Egypt Air was the airline gave us free hotel for the over night connection. Otherwise, Egypt Air service is poor in-flight as well as on- ground. Efficiency is a foreign word to the airline, it seemed. The crew seemed rough, or complacent in their behavior. Over all, I did not like the flight at all. At least, the flight from Cairo to Athens was slightly better -- clean toilet. But the flight from and to Accra-Cairo was not at all pleasant.

"Let's just say that if your not of a certain nationality you don't get preferred service. The flight attendants will ignore your light for up to an hour. My father was very ill returning from Egypt and the light was on asking for an attendant to arrive. We were not supposed to be walking around and since we were dead center to the plane we are far from all attendant anyway. When they finally arrived it was to walk by instead of stop at which point my mother tapped him and said ""excuse me, my husband is running a fever and needs to vomit but there are no bags"". They finally send someone with medication and unlimited water. Water had only been served twice on a 12 hour flight.... only with meals. The food was ok. I didn't eat second time around for fear of getting sick like my father.

People stand and loiter near the exit doors which is nerve wracking. People duck behind the flight attendants curtains to take things like water and soda willingly too. So crazy! I have never in my life seen anything like this on a flight before.

The crew does not clean during flight or collect trash, the toilets run out of paper towels and toilet paper. When we alerted the attendant they still didn't bother to fill it.

The plane was a completed wreck upon deplaning. I have never seen so much trash or food ground into the carpet in any other flight. When we offered up our trash during the flight the attendant only took it with a frown on her face.

Overall I will only fly again if I have to.

"Okay, so we were going to Egypt to meet up with a bunch of South African friends to go scuba diving. After comparing the economy and business class prices we opted for business and the extra comfort and luggage allowance. The good stuff- check in, seamless. Managed to check in our luggage through to our final destination of Hurghada and not have to collect the luggage in Cairo. Actually disbelieving that this was possible but it was- and the Egyptair rep was on hand to help us collect our bags and clear customs at Hurghada. The seats and space, slightly strange Business Class configuration of 2/3/2 but the wife and I booked a 2 so we were together with no stranger present. Plenty of space, and a seat that almost folds to a flat bed. Certainly okay for a 10 hour flight but fairly hard compared to some of the prestige airlines. The blanket was okay- but the cabin wasn't really cool (not so nice) so I didn't need it. The food was actually pretty good, no complaints at all. You get a tray with your appetizer, salad and after dinner cheese(?) and once this was eaten, we had prawns on pasta which was delicious. This was followed up with cakes and coffee etc. We had brought some over priced wine at duty free which the hostess had no problem with us drinking- they brought us glasses but we didn't advertise the fact we were drinking out of respect for our fellow travelers sensibilities. The cabin staff were okay- I'm not going out on a limb to say they were great, however they were adequate and I had no complaints. Cleanliness- again not great and the toilets were turned into tips several time due to poor passenger hygiene, I felt sorry for the staff who had to clean up after people who clearly had no idea how to operate an airline toilet, or didn't care less. I can only imagine the economy class loos with a much greater passenger density. They also dis- encouraged the business class passengers from using the forward toilets which I found strange- staff only? Finally breakfast was more that sufficient from a quantity point of view but was again acceptable rather that exceptional. Final comments about the flight- if you're going to Egypt pay for the extra space and a reasonable level of privacy, comfort and hygiene. It was worth the extra $1000 pp return for this. However the final word is the routing and the crew- the return trip in business was horrible in just about every respect and quite honestly ruined the total experience of the flight to Cairo and back.

Firstly the flight was cancelled without us even being informed and we get to the airport and go to customer care and no one is there. We were told by reception they will come down in about 30+ minutes. Then We get put onto Turkish airlines which ended up causing us a 52 hour delay. Now we have tried since the 12th of June to get confirmation from them that the flight was cancelled so our travel insurance can refund us for our connecting flights both myself and my husband have tried everything possible and we still haven't gotten a response. Also under EU law they are supposed to pay us 600 euros compensation which they are now arguing should only be 300 euros because the flight they initially put us on was only 3hrs 25 minutes later than their flight (although this was too cancelled later) so the delay was less than 4 hours which is nonsense because the flight was cancelled and putting us onto another airline doesn't count as a delay.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristen21,Cristen21 wrote a review Aug 2017,Cristen21,"Mahe Island, Seychelles",12 contributions,15 helpful votes,Rome - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r518351423-EGYPTAIR-World.html,MOST USELESS AIRLINE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I contacted the Egypt Air Toronto office this week regarding the fact I was inappropriately touched by a passenger on an Egypt Air flight last week and when I reported it to the  staff demanding to move seats they simply gossiped about it - suggested I “slap the man , toughen up and be  a strong woman”  The Toronto office ( Shoshana) said  it was my responsibility to call the police and file a written complaint and report it – none of these options were offered to me at the time I reported the man kissing my head and placing his hands up my sweater, on my skin  to grab my breast and rub my back while I was asleep.  The staff allowed him to exit the plane freely and wait for me just outside the aircraft since I had moved to a different seat. I was exhausted and cried when i saw the man waiting for me. Again asked for help  and went right back on the plane and refused to get off alone as they were instructing me to. At that point they had someone from the GTAA to walk me to immigration, he was kind enough on his own accord to ensure I got through , past the man and into a taxi. On the flight I was pretty shocked by how poorly Egypt Air dealt with the incident, the suggestion that I start a fight with a man who has 100 pounds on me IN AN AIRCRAFT   and dismiss me without any follow up or investigation. My discussion with the Toronto office today has left me further surprised that they complacently allow passengers to be assaulted, offer no help and then blame the passenger stating Egypt Air acted appropriately.  I said expect a review of their inflight incident protocols  and some sort of response from them She suggested I get a lawyer and call the police because they are totally satisfied with their actions.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aldengirl,Alden G wrote a review Aug 2017,Alden G,,5 contributions,,Cairo - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r517142707-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Terrible policies for inflight incidents,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Arrived early at each destination.
Food was excellent.
The only thing wrong was that our luggage didnt get to Sharm with us but followed on a later flight.
On top of that we were expected to go back to the airport to collect it!

"We had booked seats on MS719 from Cairo to Amman for the 29th of May 2017 Dep at 06.45 AM.At around 01.00 AM a mail was sent to us regarding the cancellation of MS 719 and we were given seats on MS 701 which was at 16.55hrs.
Now who stays awake at 1 AM when you have an early morning flight.As can be expected we only got to know as we woke up early on Mon the 29th of May.All hell broke lose as we were tourists from India in a foreign country with itinerary planned for the day in another country.Later on while doing some investigation we learnt that 719 was cancelled due to insufficient bookings and it's a common feature during Ramadan.
My complaint is if they are aware of this phenomenon why did they have to wait for the last minute.
The in-flight service was also quite horrible.Its a very short flt an hour and twenty mins.They served us some cold sandwich n threw plastic bags in for carrying whatever we were unable to eat.

"The most attractive thing for me was the time, flight was scheduled to take off at 10:30 PM which means you don't have to take the day off, you finish work then head to the airport and catch you evening flight, you arrive in Cairo at 5 AM which also means you the get the whole next day in Egypt (obviously you lose some sleeping time but that wasn't an issue for me).
Flight took off around 15 minutes late but we still landed on time so no problem there.
Even though the aircraft was a small one but it was relatively comfortable.
I was very impressed with the economy class food (check the picture) you wouldn't expect Salmon to be on the menu!
The only down side was when when we arrived to Cairo we had to wait for more than half an hour for our luggage to come out.

"Egyptair had some bad press. When I said I was flying with them, people discouraged me but I wanted to try for myself.

First of all, you get what you pay for really. It was a relatively cheap flight so I didn't expect a lot but I have to say I was impressed with the food on the flight first of all. Although I can't understand how you can serve that bread without any butter, it's so dry.

The staff were good and very patient. My major concerns are the basic standards for safety. Young children had no seat belts and weren't offered them so I was sat next to a lady with a child sat on her knee. If there had been an emergency, the child would have been crushed.

For me it's just the lack of attention to detail in some cases. So on the way out, we had access to films but I'd forgotten my headphones and asked to buy some and there weren't any. This was an opportunity for Egyptair to make a little more money but there was nothing.

On the way back from Cairo, there were no films at all just basic. Really it is what it is. The main thing that put me off was safety, I would have been ok but young children are in a lot of danger and that makes me uncomfortable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/7d/63/ef/luthilu.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luthilu,Luthilu wrote a review Jul 2017,Luthilu,"Doha, Qatar",2297 contributions,161 helpful votes,Dammam - Beirut,Middle East,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r499577080-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not as bad as people had made out.,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Operated by a narrow-bodied Boeing 738 (SU-GEI), this equipment was hardly suited to a five-hour flight when travelling as an economy passenger.  The aircraft was full, save about 6 seats, and the 3x3 seating with a centre aisle made for a fairly cramped environment.  Seat pitch was 31"", I guess.  With only two washrooms at the rear end of the single aisle, one has to strategically plan one's visit(s).  With the usual late departure (and late arrival into London) - and no apology - we never heard from the Flight Deck and minimal information was given by the Cabin Crew.  Their safety application was interesting for they allowed a passenger to visit the washroom as we were about to line-up on the runway!  The seat-back entertainment did not work for the first 90 minutes and it took about 1 hour before the Purser apologised for the inconvenience and informed us of what was occurring.  A full hot meal was served about 1 hour after take-off (beef or chicken choice) and drinks were again served about 1 hour before landing.  Service was satisfactory.  If travelling on this sector, I would recommend taking the morning MS777 operated by the larger Boeing 773 (or  the morning British Airways service) and not this flight since, apart from what I have described already, the Immigratiion queue at LHR for non-UK/EU passport holders at the time of this flight's arrival is about on hour.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/fa/3d/80/simbal09.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simbal09,Simbal09 wrote a review Jul 2017,Simbal09,"London, United Kingdom",160 contributions,109 helpful votes,Cairo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r499574492-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not to be Recommended,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Rarely does this flight depart on time, if at all: up to an hour late is common, for a variety of reasons offered by the crew.  It does reflect Egyptair's questionable punctuality record.The wide bodied Boeing 773 was a pleasure to fly aboard: clean and modern; light and airy; sufficient leg room for a 6 foot male, seat back entertainment system with a wide choice of products; sufficient washrooms; and a fast aircraft which can save time over the Boeing 738, also on this route.Service was above the normal Egyptian offering with a Captain who gave regular updates to us all; and a friendly and engaged Cabin Crew who responded quickly to requests.  A full hot dinner (choice of beef or chicken) was offered about 1 hour after take-off and drinks were, again, served about 1 hour before landing.  Both were quite sufficient and satisfactory.British Airways undoubtedly win 'service-wise' on this route whilst Egyptair qualifies as an acceptable second.

"My first time flying with Egyptair. The price was good however my connection n cairo to Istanbul was cancelled and was put on a later flight during the day. I was given a hotel, meals and shuttle service. I don't all this. However, the ONLY big disappointment was the EXTREME LONG WAIT at Cairo airport for the arrangements to be made. Landed before 5am and didnt leave the airport until about 8am. They seemed to be disorganized. Or, by looking at the pace they were working 'they didnt seem to care. Overall excellent flight, excellent service.. No alcohol served on any Egyptair flights. I didnt know this until about 2 days before i was going to fly out... huge disappointment.

"My husband and I flew from New York to Johannesburg with a 12 hour layover in Cairo. The check in process at JFK went pretty smooth as well as boarding. Our flight was full but the flight attendants were very efficient while serving food and beverages which was nice. When we arrived in Cairo on our 12 hour layover we didn't know that Egyptair provided a free room along with lunch and dinner at a hotel near the airport which was a huge plus since we were so tired from flying. The hotel and food were decent but I emphasize that it was FREE which was amazing. The flight from Cairo to Joburg was very pleasant as well no complaints.

This is a dry airline, no alcohol served, but who cares on a short midday flight?

As I was boarding the aircraft at the end of the boarding I was pleasantly supprised to be told that I was to be seat in the business class. The service and the style of the business class was a well received as I had flown down from Aberdeen a few hours before on a domestic flight that had seen my cases damaged. The crew made me feel comfortable and welcomed. Leaving late at night I didn't access any of the entertainment systems as I choose to sleep.

"We were split on making a decision on whether to fly with Egypt Air, however as we like trying different airlines and giving each a chance of providing a quality service, we thought the same of Egypt Air.

Our flight was from Bangkok to Cairo to Madrid, Spain. What an epic journey, and one to forget.
The booking in process was the same for any other airline, smooth and fast, however, when booking the flight we couldn't reserve a vegetarian meal as there was no meal option available. We did ask the check in desk and they said for some flights, this isnt an option, so couldn't reserve any non-meat menu.
We ate before boarding as we knew there could be a small chance of receiving a non-meat menu on board. Boarding was pretty hectic with hoards of people boarding the plane like it was a free for all flight.

The initial part of the flight went well with everyone settled and pretty quiet, as we thought this would continue during the early hours of the morning, however then the passangers started shouting, getting into small groups around each other and having a great time at the expense of other passangers who were trying to sleep as it was around 3am. However the loud people thought it would be nice waking everyone up and making sure no one could sleep, the airline staff did nothing to seat the people even though the fasten seatbelt sign was on.

The staff were obviously under pressure as most of the groups were guys and the staff didnt want to have any potential problems, so the other passengers like ourselves had to suffer a long flight of noise and disgusting toilets that looked like they were used by a bunch of pigs with water all over the floor inside and outside the toilet.

Meal time was even better with the staff serving meals to everyone at such a slow pace because the noisy passengers were very demanding with ordering drinks and more food and trying to keep their small groups together blocking the aisles.

Recommendation
Fly Aeroflot or someone else, save yourself the sleepless flight and pay a little extra.
Egypt Air should control these situations and ensure quality is maintained for their clients, and ensure noisy groups are controlled and silenced. Quality and cleanliness of the toilets should also be maintained during the flight, as this is probably the most disgusting flight I have personally been on where the toilets have been unusable with the floor flooded with water.
Improvement is always good including constructive criticism.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/b2/dd/58/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarysTribe,Garys-Tribe wrote a review Jun 2017,Garys-Tribe,"Wellington, United Kingdom",1474 contributions,355 helpful votes,Bangkok - Madrid,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r497094878-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Probably the worst Middle Eastern Airline,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great airline (understand that Egypt is proud of is national carrier). Already on the ground in Cairo very friendly greetings from staff. Security in Cairo is a bit over the top perhaps. But still, all done in good humour and that really does make a difference. Plane clean and all features of my business class seat worked perfectly. Welcome drinks and a nice menu. Good rest on the longhaul flight. Excellent food and service throughout. Arrived well rested. Ground security procedures at JFK also over the top, this time with no good humour at all.

"I recently flew business class with Egypt Air from Bangkok to London, one of my reasons was an Egypt Air specially offer.

I must admit that I was a little apprehensive about the flight but was very pleasantly surprised at Suvarnabhumi Airport lounge which certainly matched my usual airline’s offering.

Boarding was easy and uneventful and the business class cabin was well appointed with comfortable chairs and large TV screens although the choice of entertainment was not as wide as it could have been. Of course, alcohol was not available but as I gave up alcohol many years ago this did not concern me at all, although I can appreciate that for many this might be a disincentive to flying with Egypt Air. The cabin crew were courteous and attentive. Food was acceptable and soft drinks were available on request.

There was a 2 hour-stop over in Cairo here the lounge was small but clean and well-appointed and two hours passed fairly quickly. I was disappointed that the duty free area seemed to be closed for the night.

The second leg from Cairo to London was just as comfortable even though the plane was an older model than the BKK to Cairo leg.

We arrived on time and went through the onerous London entry checks with tolerable ease.

I would use Egypt Air again and would recommend them to anyone.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/bc/48/c8/suanphlu.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suanphlu,Suanphlu wrote a review Jun 2017,Suanphlu,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",190 contributions,119 helpful votes,Bangkok - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r496781859-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Comfort in the Skies with Egypt Air,Date of travel: November 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

EgyptAir is providing a professional service. The flight to and from Cairo is during the day and thus gives time to travel without time pressure to and from the airport. I dislike flights that cost one (part of) one's night rest. The flight was in time as most flights of EgyptAir are. Personnel is friendly and professional.

"I travelled using Egyptair for 6 times "" ""Hurghada & Saudi Arabia"" in the last 6 months.
I can say the overall experience is good the pilots were excellent , the rest of the flights crew were very good & helpful.
The food was very good on each flight i had ""They only provide drinks in the internal flights which is good as some Airlines didn't offer anything for the internal ones"".

My main concerns about Egyptair are 3 things:

1) The first one with the staff in the boarding, they are not professionals plus they lack of the communication skills & how to deal with customers as I had many problems to add my frequent flyer on the flights then I had to send emails later on to get an advise then i got a feedback that i have to wait for 15 days to add them using their portal which is another problem with the customer service agents who are responsible to answer & help anyone.

2) The second one when send them email & there was no one response for a while even when i was escalating & they responded to my requests only when I send them on twitter account asking for their help.

3) The third one maybe related to the first one which is the customer service team as you have to call them using cell phone no land lines & I called them twice asking for help & i didn't get anything from the two representatives.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/e0/c0/5f/mohamed-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D7130FDmohameda,Mohamed Abdelwahab wrote a review Jun 2017,Mohamed Abdelwahab,,35 contributions,6 helpful votes,Cairo - Medina,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r496583775-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Good ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I traveled with my wife and 3 kids (among them 2 infants), the flight attendants were really friendly and helped me a lot with my infants the flight was only delayed for few minutes. Luggage got unjustifiably delayed in Cairo Airport.
Egyptair is very generous in terms of baggage allowance and loyalty miles . The flight timing is somehow in inconvenient (takes off 5 am from Muscat).

"So I booked this flight because the times were perfect and I figured I've never been to Egypt, I'm curious what's going on there. When I arrived to my gate in JFK, everyone was wearing a hijab at least (more faces were completely covered) literally every single female! Which is absolutely fine I understand it's a religious thing and I dressed very conservative just didn't cover my hair because I didn't think it was that serious. Everyone was starring at me and it was uncomfortable. Once I got on the plane the gentleman who's seat was assignment next to mine asked to be switched so they sat me by myself, which is great I had more space. Where they placed me was allllll the way in the back by the bathroom, just imagine how awful it smelled. The bathrooms are GROSS! The staff are very RUDE and have this attitude like this is their Airline company. The food tastes very stale. Once I got to Egypt, the airport smells! The security tried to make an issue because I had tweezers in my bag... it was an absolute joke and I literally told them to through out if it was a problem. I wouldn't ever fly with them again and I don't recommend anyone to use them!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/01/65/43/ellie-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30ellier,Ellie R wrote a review Jun 2017,Ellie R,"Athens, Greece",41 contributions,20 helpful votes,New York City - Athens,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r496432337-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Never flying with Egyptair,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I Flew Economy Class last days of June 2017, going from Athens to Bahrain. You stop at Cairo and change planes, holding about 4 hours at Cairo before on to Bahrain. This starts as an about 7PM depart ATH, and ends in Bahrain about 3 AM. As in most ""red eye"" flights the air crew feeds the passengers early and the plane flights are mostly ""lights out"".

The good: The airline baggage policy is liberal for an economy class flyer. The seating arrangement is adequate with none of the nasty ""pay more for 4 CM of extra leg room, or a 2 CM wider seat, passenger fare gouging charges"" that far too many airlines have concocted lately.

The food was edible and recognizable - a decent standard for red eye flights anywhere.

Crew cabin service was professional, prompt and alert.

The only actual ""not so good"" is NOT about Egypt Air, but specific to this flight. There is a not much for anyone, what-so-ever to do with hours on your hands at Cairo Airport. Food services are scarce and pretty much bottom of the barrel, with limited seating while you wait. At late night the airport is mostly just closed up shops.

Summary: The flight(s) were fine, service professional. Because it was the best (shortest delay) set of interconnections available on ATH to BAH I have used this flight several times. It is a decent value.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renoelder,renoelder wrote a review Jun 2017,renoelder,"Amwaj Islands, Bahrain",32 contributions,48 helpful votes,Athens - Bahrain,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r496365188-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Decent Flying Value for The Price,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The best way to fly to Egypt these time is taking Egypt Air. The service is fair and the flights are mostly in time. Flying to Sharm el Sheikh, Luxor or Hurgada there will be a stop over in Cairo, which is okay. The flight back is a bit more difficult because of the rush hour between 7 and 11 am in Cairo, almost all international flights start at that time.

"Going from Toronto to Cairo I found the flight not bad, tbh. The food was excellent and piping hot! The staff were nice and I did not require their help at anytime during the flight, and I saw that they were always available to help other passengers. The seats weren't the best and I was lucky that the person in front of me didn't recline. As for in-flight entertainment, there weren't screens at every seat; just some scattered around the cabin. There 8 music channels, and 1 was in English.

On the way from Cairo to Toronto, I was very pleased to see that we were on a Boeing 777, which made for more comfortable seats. As before, the food was very good and I was happy to see screens for every seat!

"Unfortunately I have to fly with EgyptAir quite a lot as this is the only decent connection I have to places I have to visit for work. I have experienced a lot of airlines, from top-end to low-cost, and this must be one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with.

1. Leaving aside the rudeness of staff at Cairo Airport, staff on board of several flights I have taken were very unfriendly. One episode concerned being ordered(!) by a flight attendant to close the window blind. When asked why (in a friendly manner) the answer was ""because you must"". I have also never experienced having to wait for 20 minutes for the washroom because 4 flight crew members needed to use them for own needs and cut in line without an apology.

2. EgyptAir is the first and only airline where I have experienced the plane starting driving towards the runway while passengers were still finding their seats - again flight crew was clueless.

3. If you are a StarAliance member and want to claim your miles - be ready not to get them.

4. Finally, I understand this is not everyone's priority, so this is a last comment - this is a dry airline with only choice of Pepsi or juice on board. Last flight I took - there was only choice of apple juice or water on board.

If you have a choice, do not fly with EgyptAir and it is a shame for StarAliance to have such an airline spoil their reputation.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/57/f9/1d/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nefeli-nat,Nefeli-nat wrote a review May 2017,Nefeli-nat,"New Delhi, India",89 contributions,33 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Cairo,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r486760715-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not sure how this airline is a part of Star Alliance,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I always find the customer service to be the best thing about Egyptair. The crew are always friendly and professional, and the main reason why I would prefer to use Egyptair over BA on the same route.

My only criticisms would be that Egyptair seem to have put the 737 aircraft on the Cairo to London route. Although the aircraft is ok it is far less superior than the 777 aircraft which used to be used on the route. Four and bit hours is a little long with limited in flight entertainment and no electronic devices.

Also Cairo airport isn't for the faint hearted.

I flew from Cairo to Rome and Egyptair canceled my flight and put me on a flight 5+ hours earlier which was not convenient for me! They notified me by ONE email of this drastic change and I didn't even notice until two days before my flight. I told them that I needed to fly that day later in the day and there was nothing flight wise that they could do for me so I asked if I could use the first class lounge or get a hotel voucher for the inconvenience and they said there was nothing they could do for me. Terrible customer service. They should have offered something for the inconvenience even if it was simply priority check-in or an upgrade. I am very dissatisfied.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calama1995,calama1995 wrote a review May 2017,calama1995,"Alexandria, Egypt",4 contributions,14 helpful votes,Cairo - Rome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r482686576-EGYPTAIR-World.html,EgyptAir canceled my flight and wouldn't do anything to help,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew from London Heathrow business class to Egypt
Airoplane was very busy, all seats taken
Bit half hearted putting business class on plane first, which is normal with the other airlines
Food was a choice of beef,chicken or seafood
Other airlines offer business passengers a menu! Not normally shown hot dishes brought into the isles to select from!
Beef was inedible but apparently the seafood was ok
None of the extras were offered which normally happens in business class

"This was my first long flight and I was worried about the leg room and comfort specially that I have back issues and I was flying economy class but I was surprised by the comfort of the flight.
Flight took off 30 mins late due to heavy traffic in CAI but arrived at the exact arrival time.
Take off was good, landing was bumpy (will talk about it in a bit), crew members are very friendly in a way that made me thank their supervisor for their efforts. The crew members kept checking on the passenger from time to time, and I personally needed medication that they provided me instantly. Also during the flight a passenger had a medical issue and all of the sudden I found almost half the crew helping her including the captain. And not only that but also after she was treated and everything was OK they kept checking on her from time to time and they were well prepared and well trained in handling this case.

Entertainment system was up to date and found most of the new movies on the plane, along with the classics. However the series section (Arabic and English) needs to be updated cause you find only 2 or 3 episodes of each series.

Bathrooms was clean during the whole flight which was a concern to me in such long flight.

Meals are good not the perfect meal but it's OK.

Check-in process took a little bit of time but was acceptable in CAI and the online check-in saves you a lot of time.

One of my bags were damaged and I opened a complaint with Egypt Air through their website and they have contacted me the next day to check for the damage and the needed compensation, and they kept updating me with all the steps of the compensation till I received the bag value back in Cairo.

Another note, boarding at the gate itself takes a lot of time due to the security check (again) that they do before entering the gate. With such huge plane and large number of passengers it takes a lot of time.

Overall experience is good and I will definitely fly on Egypt Air again specially that this is a direct flight which I prefer the most.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/d9/69/be/mahmoudg790.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mahmoudg790,mahmoudg790 wrote a review May 2017,mahmoudg790,"Cairo, Egypt",26 contributions,8 helpful votes,Cairo - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r481388841-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Very comfy 12 hours flight,Date of travel: March 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was first time for me to fly by EGYPTAIR. On 8April 17 our flight was at 8 pm, so we came to the airport at 5 pm. The Air port authority did not allow us to enter the Airport. We came to know that due to Haboob (sandy wind) the flight is delayed for unknown time. Then we had been waiting outside the airport. When we contacted the Information desk they said still they dont know when the flight will fly. Finally they said us to come at night 3 am. We came at 3 am and could checked in with the next day morning flight. Our boarding card was changed. During this period they did not provide us any water or food or accommodation. They finally started 8:30 am on 9 April 17. 12 hours time wasted for nothing.

While coming back from Cairo to Khartoum, the same misfortune happens. This time it was 18 hours delay. But in Cairo, they provided us some food, drinks and water.

"I traveled with my elderly parents business class on Egyptair business class to have a comfortable flight as I just had a heart issue. The three business class seats were defective and the flight attendants tried to help but in vain! They explained that the plane used to travel to the gulf and kids played with seats and no money to repair.... Unacceptable excuses of course. They handed me a form to complain which I have filled and handed back but of course no response back! I wrote emails to the ""we care"" costumer service who responded asking for more details and finally responded after few weeks saying ""the flight attendant reported that they changed your seat"" imagine 3 seats are not working and we talked to 3 different attendants including the chef and they come back with such a response not even a sorry!!!! I travel frequently and never met such situation on any other airlines. In a normal airline, they compensate you and apologize with Egyptair they lie and not even say sorry!!! I canceled my return ticket and will never travel or recommend it for sure. Also on business after few hours I needed to take my medication so asked for snack and the flight attendants looked to each other as if I am asking for mysterious object and handed me a small piece of cake after internal discussion on what a snack:).

Egyptair probably offer these facilities on the long haul flights only. I flew from Vienna to Cairo - which is an almost 4 hours intercontinental flight - and there were no TV screens in the plane. Forget about WiFi!

3- They can postpone your flight for hours without even telling you or offering convenient areas to wait.

"This route and airline was chosen at very short notice and essentially on price, whilst remaining within the Star Alliance group. The experience was surprisingly good.
As a regular business flyer with Etihad it fell down on some aspects of what I consider my yardstick. The food was not planned when I wanted it, the food service was all at once and not course by course and the flight is dry...but the question is did this matter?
At £600 less than Etihad, the food was acceptable and tasty, the range of juices perfectly acceptable and the most important reasons for business class, the space and the bed, were OK. By using early on-line check-in it was possible to ensure we both had aisle access seats, and the space was perfectly acceptable to provide an pleasant flight. The beds sadly do not recline, only to about 170 degrees, but the comfort of the seats was excellent, which somehow overcame the lack of a flat bed.
Business cabin staff are older than most airlines, but very pleasant and helpful.
One concern...my partner had ordered gluten free food which was supplied by the airline, but was not at all inspirational, being three identical G/F salads at one meal. The staff clearly did not understand the significance with a gluten free meal and the medical issues surrounding thev condition. The continual offers of bread rolls (despite G/F bread having been provided) was surprising, and there was clearly no understanding of the risks which contamination may cause.

In Cairo we had a significant stop-over and a hotel with no charge for visa was immediately provided on demand, with a limo transfer promptly arranged. We liked this with a tour of the pyramids and Sphinx...quite a memorable extra to the trip.

Overall they were good and, given the price, I'd certainly use them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/68/27/8e/sawaddee.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sawaddee,Dave S wrote a review Feb 2017,Dave S,"Norwich, United Kingdom",265 contributions,186 helpful votes,London - Bangkok,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r461201385-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Surprisingly good,Date of travel: January 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was a used blanket on our seat and a request to get blanket was initially ignored. She came back saying no blankets from Business Class section. She got them from Economy Class.

"Pros: Seats are comfortable, clean, amenity kits, entertainment fine.         Lounge in Cairo was nice and comfy.Cons: No alcohol, which is fair - that's not a problem.           But on each of the 4 flights on      Egyptair we received literally 1 cup of          pepsi with dinner - this included 2x 12hour flights.Dinner all around was actually ggod - breakfast was horrible as the croissants were so dry they literally snapped in half.EVERY ONE OF THE 4 FLIGHTS TOOK OFF ABOUT AN HOUR LATE!ONCE-OFF INCIDENT:On the leg from JFK - CAIRO the captain's (I assume) family was sitting around us - all the staff literally ignored us and mobbed around them.

"This was my first time travelling with Egypt Airways, and to be honest I was not expecting much as it is known to be an economy airlines. I was flying transit from Amman to Cairo and then from there to Sharm El-Sheikh. Both flights were late. The flight from Amman to Cairo was not too full and so there was a lot of space since there was nobody in the exact seat next to me. The plane was really clean and the staff were very nice. I was sleeping and they woke me up to eat. The food is simple , no hot cooked meals. On the flight back to amman, it was cold pasta. It would be nice if the meals were hot especially in the winter. There was not on-board entertainment, but I did not mind as I needed to catch up on sleep. The flight from Cairo to Sharm was an hour late as we were on the 8 PM flight and they had merged the 8PM flight and 9PM flight together as they called the other passengers to come to our gate. This was inconvenient as we were a whole hour late, so that the Airways would not have to send out two planes that were not entirely full, but I guess that is how they keep their tickets cheap and affordable. The staff were very helpful and I would fly with them again, but I hope they improve in terns of timing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/1b/5a/74/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lamaobeid,Lama Obeid wrote a review Jan 2017,Lama Obeid,"West Bank, Palestinian Territories",618 contributions,100 helpful votes,Amman - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r455363179-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Better than I thought,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Anyway, I advise to check-in 24 hours in advance online. It'll make the process at the airport a bit shorter(not much though)
Flights never leave on time so calculate a delay on arrival (watch out for your connecting flights !).

Apart from that you get most of what you can expect from flying in economy these days.
Food wasn't great (but I guess that's subjective, as always).
Be sure to have your luggage wrapped in foil at the airport before check-in . EGYPTAIR frequently demands luggage to be wrapped ...it'll save you time during check-in.

"This airline seems a bit old-fashioned but that's exactly what's great about it. They don't crunch as many seats as possible as it seems to be the new trend, but rather keep a very nice leg space. I'm 1.85 meters tall, and this has been so far the best flight I had in terms of room between the seats. I could seat without having my legs touching the next seat and sleep comfortably when the seat was reclined. Furthermore, the seats have these nice headrests consisting of two flaps on the side that you can bend and keep your neck straight when you sleep.
Food-wise, you have many meal options during check-in, including vegetarian, low-fat, kosher, halal, etc. I didn't pick any restriction and the food was decent. My girlfriend went for the low-fat one, which she found to be very good.
They also keep these nice little touches like giving you a bag with fly socks, toothpaste, sleeping mask, etc.
Perhaps the most negative part was the layover at Cairo, where things seem a bit too crazy. Even if we were taking a connecting flight, we still had to go through 2 more security controls that moved extremely slowly. Furthermore, on one of them they separated men from women, having the men going first, which was not pleasant to experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/52/22/20/german-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603germank,German K wrote a review Jan 2017,German K,"Sicily, Italy",3 contributions,3 helpful votes,Rome - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r451819669-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Best airline experience ever,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew Egypt Air within Egypt, and they are fine to fly. However, they did the baggage handling for Middle East Airlines, and lost my bag. It was a big problem for them since I had my boarding ticket but no baggage claim ticket. Finally found the office in another terminal, and they were really helpful. Someone sent me downstairs to this filthy part of the airport to make a claim, and then he abandoned me when I was down there. They did put in the information into their DOS computer, and I thought I'd never see my bag. Did get email 4 days later that it arrived, but I had no workable wifi and I couldn't abandon my tour. You have to call from 10-4 each day to check on the bag, but no one picks up. Can only retrieve bag from 10-2. Last day I got there early to get my bag. Had to give passport to a stranger, pay them 20 Egyptian pounds for the police, and then wait for our group of 7 to go look for our bags. One guys had been lost a week and it was still lost. I did find mine, and they took our bags and had the police search them. I don't know why since they'd had mine for a week. When I thought baggage handler was going to return my passport, I opened my wallet. There was a dollar sticking up, and he grabbed it. Guy stole a dollar from me. He had my passport so what could I do?

The seat on the business class was very uncomfortable. You can't really convert it into a bed because the legrest cannot be set to a horizontal position. It is a leather seat so you keep sliding down. The amenity kit is basically a plastic bag, and no ear plugs are provided. Staff is not helpful and rather cocky. When I asked for a coffee, I was told to wait for breakfast. When I got coffee later, it turned out to be tea. In Cairo we had to pay for the lounge regardless that no business class was availabe to our final destination, and we flew business class there. Staff was again impolite and unprofessional.

"On both occasions that I flew on this airline the flights were delayed. The first time by more than an hour and the second time by over 2hours. The delays were not due to technical issues but because of them needing to load cargo and baggage. The second delay caused us to miss our connecting flight. When I explained to the hostess that the 2 hour delay would leave us very little time to make the connecting flight and asked for assistance to get us off the plane first, she was totally disinterested and in fact ignored the request.
What makes it worse is that they are aware that the flight will be delayed but still get you to board and then you sit on the plane waiting for the baggage to be loaded.

"I was hoping for a better experience considering this airline is part of the Star Alliance, but I was not very impressed. I had two flights in a row with Egyptair (Nairobi-Cairo and Cairo-NYC) and it made for an extremely long day. Not one, but BOTH flights had delays (the only reason I didn't miss the second one...), my baggage was clearly handled roughly, the legroom made the trip uncomfortable, there was no option for a gluten-free meal (which is an important part of my health and I had to go hungry), and the selection of movies/shows was very poor. I'm glad I got there safely, but it could have been SO much more pleasurable for the amount of money I paid.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4784BQkellyd,Kelly D wrote a review Jan 2017,Kelly D,,1 contribution,,Nairobi - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r448696262-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Not Very Impressed,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We had a great flight with Egypt Air to and from Cairo. Also flew between Cairo and Aswan as well as Luxor to Cairo. All enjoyable flights with a friendly staff.

"Flying Egyptair is really all bout the destination you fly to. Apprently, now that I flew to their Homebase, I have to adjust my earlier opinion. That was, flying to NBO quite OK. The experience I had last week isn't nice.
The evening before departure date I checked in online, printed boarding passes.
Everything packed in our 2 hiking bags and went to the console to print the luggage label
(only 1 piece 13kg luggage for 3 pax)
The security check is abolishing ! Eventhough w are experienced travellers and did NOT BEEP when passing the detector, somebody fysically had to touch our bodies, which feels you are treated like a criminal. WE DID NOT BEEP.
Having a boarding pass and labelled luggage I wanted to drop off quickly.Not working. I was forced to stand in line, because they wanted to check my passport.
Thus completely nullificating the of the checkin online + console printed luggage label.
Once aboard (which takes AGES because all travellers ignore HANDLUGGAGE size regulations) you are bathing in Moslim Prayers which is in my opinion completely NOT DONE for a Star alliance member. Other people around me felt uncomfortable, I was rather disturbed by this.
Friendliness of staff was OK. No entertainment aboard. It's a short flight so i didn't bother much, but than : please do not promote your inflight entertainment is you do not have any.

"I have travelled with Egypt Air numerous times, however, my first experiences were bad but as I travelled with Egypt Air more the level of service I received gradually improved and I must say when I used Egypt Air in July, I was shocked as it was as if I was on a different Airline! The service was good as the crew was very friendly, the food was mediocre (the best food I have eaten was on a Saudi Airlines flight to Jeddah in 2015) - the food that was served on this flight was some rice with chicken which was juicy and tender and not like the dried up, overcooked remnants that you would find on other middle eastern airlines.

The cleanliness of the Aircraft was good and the crew was consistently made sure the toilets were kept clean. Even though it was a full flight the crew managed to tend to anyone need service and reasonably quick too! The in-flight entertainment was decent as they had the latest movies on selection.

Considering the food, service given and overall quality of the aircraft I would certainly travel with Egypt Air again and for this I rate this Airline a 7/10",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omarabdulq,Omar Abdul Q wrote a review Dec 2016,Omar Abdul Q,"London, United Kingdom",59 contributions,13 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r447925903-EGYPTAIR-World.html,From Bad to Consistently Good,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am deeply anguished with the attitude of Egypt Air and its insensitivity. I was travelling from Cairo to Mumbai on 27th Dec 16. We had earlier informed our tour operator to arrange for Vegetarian Meal or Hindu Non-Veg (Only Chicken and Fish allowed, but no Beef or Pork) food. However in the flight we were rudely told that they have limited stock of Chickens and can only provide Beefs. This is highest degree of insensitivity. Can they dare to ask Muslim passengers to eat Pork? One can easily imagine the reaction from Muslims if such a thing ever happen. Finally I managed to get Chicken meal. Food quality was of lowest order. But more than the food quality, I want to condemn the insensitivity towards religious feelings. This is unpardonable. I am seriously thinking of writing to the Civil aviation Ministry of Government of India to bar this airline from operating in India.
I have already filled up the feedback form with my experience in detail and handed over to the flight attendant. Waiting for their apology.

"We have flown 3 times but the very last one it was a nightmare.

The first two were ok, the seats were not that comfortable though but they were smooth flights in all.

Cabin cleanliness was good and lavatories were like any other airline I've flown.

The crew were polite and friendly.
Smooth take-offs and landings however Cairo Airport remains a dump as far as I'm concerned and leaves a lot to be desired, though I hardly think that's Egyptair's fault at all.

The third trip though, from Sharm el Sheikh to Cairo we left with a delay but that was minor compared to the rest of the trip.

The cabin was so hot and nothing could be done to have it fixed on air.

Throughout the flight we had the feeling that something was wrong and we could not enjoy the flight at all. There were times that it was so hot that we could not stand it anymore.

Everybody was worried and scared. Personally, I will never fly with them again.

"Breaks my heart to write a bad review on my national carrier but I've been pushing this off for years and doesn't seem to be any improvement on the horizon, in terms of keeping to scheduled departure time. It's simply absurd that passengers are hoarded onto the plane only to be told that there will be a delay in departure which ends up lasting a good hour and a half! And the reasons given are ridiculous!   On a brighter note, I've found the planes to be in pretty good shape and seats are comfortable which is quite an improvement.

Service too was very attentive and pleasant personalities.

"I am a Canadian living in Africa and no had recently traveled from Uganda to London with Egyptair.  The flight was fine, nothing to write home about, but to problems.  Egypt Air is a points partner with Air Canada.  I gave Egypt Air my account number for Aeroplan points when I bought the ticket.  After my flights, I was only credited with the return flight, not the outbound one.  I contacted Aeroplan, who contacted Egypt Air and I received confirmation of my points being credited for the outbound flight.  One week later, I received another email telling me my request for points was denied because of the class of the ticket I bought.  In fact I still have the credit for the Inbound flight.  Communicating with Egypt Air about this is next to impossible.

"I'd done a ton of research about flights to South Africa and at the end of the day it came down to a choice between Turkish Airlines and Egyptair. We chose Egyptair as it was cheaper by about £80 per person and we ended up paying £475 return each which we felt was pretty good. The layovers in Cairo were nice and short, just 3 hours maximum each time and the departure and arrival times were convenient too.

Flights themselves were pretty basic. Food was fine - I ate everything but the lack of alcohol was a bit tough. We did have some miniatures with us but as no ice or tonic was served the lukewarm gin and sprite wasn't that great.

There were no delays at all although there was some confusion at Johannesburg where the checking in staff insisted on us getting our luggage wrapped (due to thefts we assume) and this meant queuing twice for ages which was annoying.

In flight entertainment wasn't great but we both had books we wanted to read. One of the flights didn't have seatback screens.

I think next time I'd probably pay a bit more and we'd definitely think about direct flights although they are way more expensive. For this trip Egyptair was fine and no regrets about using them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/21/75/07/timmanchester.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimManchester,TimManchester wrote a review Nov 2016,TimManchester,"Sale, United Kingdom",947 contributions,196 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r438466739-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Cheap and basic,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was the first time that my wife and I had flown EgyptAir internationally and only did so as this was one of the options provided by Aeroplan for our trip from Toronto to Johannesburg.

We were both very pleasantly surprised. Our first leg, a 10-hour flight from Toronto to Cairo, was in business class on a Boeing 777-300. It's a 2-2-2 configuration and we had tons of space all around us. There was a couple flying with a baby on the other side of the cabin and they were able to put a small bed (provided by EgyptAir) on the floor in front of them, with space to spare. The plane was very clean, the seats were comfortable, and the food was good. The cabin crew were pleasant and quite efficient. They could be a little friendlier (don't wake me up to eat), but we had no real complaints whatsoever. Note, however, that this is a ""dry"" airline (which we knew prior to our flights), so one has to be somewhat creative if one wants to enjoy wine or other liquor during the flight.

Our second leg, from Cairo to Johannesburg, was an 8-hour overnight flight on an Airbus A330-300. This was also a 2-2-2 configuration, and while the seats were much closer together, we still had sufficient room to stretch out on the lay-flat seats. Again, the plane was very clean, the seats were comfortable, the food was good, and the cabin crew pleasant and efficient.

Overall, we had a very pleasant experience on both legs of our trip. All of their crew (airport check-in, cabin crew, pilots) were cordial and efficient. I would definitely fly with EgyptAir again and definitely in business class.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/31/40/7f/ralph-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDM2000,Ralph M wrote a review Nov 2016,Ralph M,"Toronto, Canada",55 contributions,52 helpful votes,Toronto - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r438367767-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Pleasantly surprised and would fly with EgyptAir again,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Egypt air itself is not bad, the flight is comfortable and service is okay though no alcohol. Crews are nice as well. The main problem in this flight is if you have a transit, which they provide you a free accommodation and meals. The people who are in that accommodation desk think us if we are travelling free or us if you are a illegal immigrants. They will let you wait for approx 2 hours for you accommodation and when you get the paper from there, they will take you out from the airport, hotel transport will pick you up, the transportation process is not bad. But when you arrive at hotel you have to wait for another 1 hour to get a room. The worse I faced was in hotel Novotel, when I went to have a meal they didn't allow you to buffet. They will ask you to sit in another sitting area and the waiter will put as much as rice and chicken and serve you, this is the worse part. I asked the waiter that how did you know that I eat rice and chicken because I am vegetarian. They said that it is a set meal for Egypt air passengers. I had a bad experience and I noticed they dealt very badly particularly with African passengers. I will never fly with this airline again and if you are not transiting in Egypt than its fine otherwise, avoid it.

The crews are always polite and very helpful, food is the same as all the other airlines and the seat pitch as good as any other scheduled airline, not to forgetting the 46kg baggage allowance.

The pilots on the domestic flights are ex air force pilots and on my last flight back to Cairo from Sharm I didn't even realise that we had taken off.

"I almost took the business class upgrade for around $300 usd. However when I went online to make the purchase it was no longer available. Lucky me - since the flight was 3/4 empty.

I was able to secure the entire middle row - GREAT! I can lay down and sleep the 9hr route. Wrong.... Egypt Air fixes the arm rests in the center so you can't lay down. It must be the craziest thing I've seen... Makes no sense.

Additionally people were allowed to:

- Keep there legs out across the row so you effectively couldn't get to the bathroom
- Keep their window open at 'night' so you have bright light shining in

Add in annoyances like:

- No in-seat entertainment, just an Egyptian movie
- No water allowed on board - for 9 hours I had exactly three small glasses of water (and had to ring for one of them) - talk about dehydration
- Inability to adjust the headrest on the seats
- Totally average to sub-average food (I ate none of it, just picked a few pieces and went hungry)

I did my research beforehand (I thought) and they have a good safety rating (er.. except..) and I got a good deal on the flight. However I didn't understand I'd have to sacrifice basic / standard flying comforts and be treated like cattle.

Not to mention I had to go through no less than THREE full security checks to board the flight (meaning 3 x-rays, 3x opening suitcase, 3x taking off shoes and belt etc)... No water on the plane - really guys?

No inflight entertainment or snacks, only drinks with plastic cups including hot beverages, so don't burn yourself!

The safety briefing just finished 5 seconds prior take off.

There were not so many passengers, so the meals were served very quickly. 30 sec after i ve received my meal, hostess arrived already with tea!
Even if it was a night flight, lights were deemed only 20 min prior landing, not giving any chance to rest a bit.

Basically if you want a cheap flight, that s the one. If you looking for some comfort use another company.

"First although not necessarily Egyptair's fault as with many airports outside the US and Europe you must pass through ""security"" before you even check in. However if they wanted to change the process being the airline of Egypt they could, but as with everything in Egypt it is just the way things are! It is disaster and actually unsafe if you are worried about flying on a plane with no security. Its also a giant scam that the Egyptian police take part in right in front of you! You pay the guys wearing light blue t-shirts and they will shove other people out of line and push their luggage off the X-Ray belts for you. So nice! If you go with that process while stressful you will get through sooner. They also totally block the lines with luggage carts and use their bodies to stop the majority of people not paying them right in front of the police this happens literally right up to the scanner.

However everyone's luggage is going though stacked on-top of one another, shoes, bags, people arguing, the police not paying attention or doing their jobs, and the guys supposedly watching the x-rays are reading or texting, so its all a bit of a scam that's a giant pain. Watch your things if possible coming out the other side as they just get dumped all over the floor and people are just taking things. You have to be aggressive or you wont get in!

We tried to avoid the fun above as we arrive from Luxor on Egyptair the same morning as our flight Egyptair Dubai flight departing in a couple hours. But unfortunately we had to collect our luggage in Cairo and re-check it as that's how Egyptair does things as told to us by the not friendly agent in Luxor for Egyptair, thus making the above ""security"" a giant pain thank you Egyptair.

Once we battled our way throught ""security"" we checked into our counter and unfortunately we were changing to Emirates in Dubai so Egyptair said we would have to get our bags again in Dubai and re-check them. So efficient. Anyhow fortunately it all worked out.

But that experience and my previous days experiences getting to Luxor from Cairo which takes 1hour was not so pleasant so I am not in love with Egyptair. No one gives a s..t is their motto!

"it is quite scandalous that this airline is a member of the Star Alliance. Aside from the seat, business class service is at or below the level of coach on United.There is no alcohol. This has nothing to do with religion (many mid east airlines serve alcohol) and  has everything to do with ripping off the customer. The food is all brought out on a cart ( with a ketchup bottle no less) and allowed to sit till the flight attendants feel like serving it. You then point at the plate you want. The restrooms used by the flight attendants are off limits to the passengers (or so they say).   The passenger sitting next to me sat down because the seat was empty. Some attempt was made to have her sit in her assigned seat but then the passenger with this seat was told to sit in her seat. Security is a joke. You go thru security at the gate for crying out loud.

"I booked Egypt Air purely for the price as they were the cheapest airline flying to Johannesburg. The flight from London was comfortable and there were plenty drinks and as usual the food seems to be served after hours of waiting. Good meals and a choice of two, beef or chicken. The stop over in Egypt was only an hour and a half so not too bad. It's always strange how the airlines choose the planes for the connecting flights as my plane from Egypt to Johannesburg seemed to be and older model. The flight itself was comfortable but the service wasn't great. I had to buzz the steward twice and she still took her time to arrive. The food was late, and after a period of time the staff disappeared. I think they all went to sleep. The staff looked miserable and unhappy and it felt as if the passengers were more of a burden. I'd rather they pretend to be happy, as their unhappiness was pretty obvious. And how about employing younger ladies, presentation is everything. If you after cheap prices and don't mind crappy service then it's worth booking Egypt Air, but if there was a choice of cheap prices with some of the top airlines, I would certainly book that.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanm359,deanm359 wrote a review Sep 2016,deanm359,London,4 contributions,,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r423392439-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Nothing Special,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had to take an emergency flight to the US, while EgyptAir was the only flight I could get in such a rush, the treatment I received on the flight was horrific.

I waited and they never came back, had to wait until they served the meal. After the meal, I asked for another cup of coffee, but was told that they were not serving at that time, yet the same attendant went a few rows ahead of me and served several other passengers. When I tried to get their attention, the attendant turned her back to me. I finally asked the attendant in the other aisle what was going on, he said he didn't know and got me the supervisor.

"Flew Egyptair roundtrip from London to Sharm El Sheikh, with a layover in Cairo. The whole experience from booking the flights to getting on the plane was unpleasant - customer service is terrible. About two weeks before my flight, I get an e-mail saying that our flight from LHR to CAI was cancelled and we would be moved to an earlier flight - 8 hours earlier! This became an issue with my hotels, as we now had to book an extra night, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but we had bought air & hotel together in a package. When I tried to change my flights to a day later or at least get them to cover a night hotel, I was told ""This is not our problem, do not call here again with this issue."". I tried to sort it out again when I got to London (we were coming from the US), but I was told again ""This is not our issue."" Eventually, it got sorted, but it was extremely unpleasant.

As for the actually flights, the first was ok. We flew on an A330 from London to Cairo, which seemed to be in good conditions. The flight attendants were slightly more pleasant then they were on the phone, but I guess you cant expect more. The food was decent when compared to US airline food (but that is a low bar to leap over), and the inflight entertainment was pretty good. Our second flight from Cairo to Sharm was on a very old 737. The interior was faded and browning, seats didn't work, and it smelled. Our flight back from Sharm back to Cairo, we were on a poorly maintained regional jet. I am shocked we actually made it alive. The plane would rattle every time we hit a bump, there was a crack in the exterior window at my seat, and like the first plane, many seats didn't work. Our last flight with Egyptair was from Cairo back to London, on the same A330 that we took going - so it was ok.

All that said - try to avoid if possible, but not the worst if you can't.

"Upgraded to Business Class at Airport. Seat very comfortable on the way out although entertainment and food rather poor. Service was the same as being in Economy. Upgraded again on flight back. Would not have bothered if I had known it was such an old plane. It even had the old fashioned ashtrays in the arm rests. There was extra leg room but the foot rest was so far in front that my 6ft brother could not reach it.

"I am a frequent traveller who travel every 3 to 4 weeks to different locations,

I have used the following airlines during my flights and will recommend them based on my preference:

1- Egyptair

They provide two pieces of luggage in Economy, they usually fly on time
travelling in the morning from Cairo and returning afternoon planes are really big comfort with proper entertainment.

The Food is not the best, I will rate it as average however I use a trick to book special meet e.g. seafood from London, then the food is amazing as it seems they have to cater it in heathrow not egypt.

2- BA my second favorite:

the seats are not as comfort as Egypt Air but the food is better, also they take complains seriously not like Egyptair, e.g. my luggage was replaced once due to damage in heathrow and I was once compensated money for delay more than 4 hours.

3- Lufthansa

I got it more than once in short durations to Europe, e.g. Dusseldorf through frankfort
it is fine, just fine and no entertainment.

4- Turkish

"After the total loss of MS804 in May we were apprehensive about the reliability and maintenance of Egypt's national airline; in fact we wished that we'd chosen another airline with a better safety record.
However, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the planes and the efficiency of our transfer to Johannesburg via Cairo; our luggage arrived on the carousel at our destination without a hitch, which is more than I can say for the appalling American Airlines. Furthermore, the cabin crew were polite and professional (unlike AA who are extremely rude and arrogant) and the quality of the in flight refreshments was excellent and very tasty. There was ample leg room even in economy and the seats were comfortable. The choice of in flight entertainment was a bit limited when compared to other airlines, but on a 'red-eye' flight this was hardly an issue. The Muslim prayer for a safe journey that was played on the seat-back screens just prior to take off didn't inspire much confidence, but in retrospect I would definitely fly with Egyptair in the future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/25/02/d6/c41gbh.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C41GBH,C41GBH wrote a review Sep 2016,C41GBH,"Camborne, United Kingdom",27 contributions,20 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r413605268-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Better than expected; much better than American Airlines!,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"London to  Cairo with Egyptair. It seems completely ok continue using your phone during take off, play the safety video while you are taking off (which I couldn't hear due to noise of engines), have your seat reclined etc. They even let passengers get up and go to the toilet when the plane is queuing for the runway. I joined the plane as a business class passenger, sat in my seat and was asked to check my ticket - not sure why, nobody else was asked to prove they were in the right seat. We then sat for nearly an hour (including 30 minutes delay) where no refreshments were offered. When they were finally offered, by the time they got to me, there was just an orange juice and it was as if I was expected to take this drink when the other guests were offered choice The plane was ancient for a 5 hour flight and the seats even had ash trays as well as broken seats and TV screens.

"Egyptair are a GREAT airline to fly with and I would very HIGHLY recommend them every time.
OK, their prices may be a little higher than flights on Thomson, Thomas Cook etc but when you add up all of the 'extras' Egyptair actually works out quite reasonable.
Firstly, the price of your luggage allowance is INCLUDED and you get a fantastic 46 kg allowance (2 bags @ 23 kg each).
Secondly, leg room is a lot more spacious and comfortable.
Thirdly, all drinks are free, although Egyptair only serve soft drinks, no alcohol at all.
Fourthly, you et a free meal and a choice, usually, meat, chicken or fish and vegetarian option can be pre-booked.
Finally, the service on board is efficient, staff are friendly and accommodating and each seat is provided with a pillow and blanket to ensure the passengers comfort throughout the flight.

"I only flew this airline on a roundtrip from New York to Cairo.  On the way there, it was packed to the gills - there were people everywhere.  The plane was very animated (people were talking loudly, but they were not arguing. I think they were just excited).  There was a meal, but I cannot recall what it was.  I stayed awake the entire flight (I never sleep on flights).  When we landed, it was a little unusual as we got off on the side of the runway.  On the way back, the plane was basically empty.  I had a whole row to myself and again I stayed awake.  Even with the few people that were on there, the flight was still kind of loud (but not enough to annoy any one - I hope).  There was one child that was screaming but she soon calmed down and fell asleep... probably from pure exhaustion.  We experienced a lot of turbulence and the staff was very nice.  The landing however, made me a little wary of using them again.  We came in at a steep decline (I literally had my feet on the floor to prevent me from sliding forward).

"When flying as an expat from Cairo to Brussels with all our stuff and 5 cats ... yes we had 5 cats with us and it is totally normal and possible ... we had a very poor experience at Cairo Airport, this is probably the worst airport I have ever been, altough Jeddah was also disastrous ... but as soon as we boarded the flight these horrors seemed like a bad dream.
Egyptair is right up there in the rankings with all other major national airlines and they offer great service to their guests, food was server nicely on time and clean, no hassle to sell and multiple visits to ask if we needed something to drink from water to tea or coffee, free of charge, a very nice break from the constant hassling for tips that we were used to when living in Cairo, even Security staff at the airport was more chasing foreigners for tips than actually perform the tasks of a real Security Officer.

"Egyptair consistently has the best prices out of Lagos, but it doesn't fly every day.  Take care, as one of the reasons I selected this airline was for miles as part of the Star Alliance; however, the economy ticket class I purchased were ineligible for miles. In spite of having a 3 hour layover in Cairo, both pieces of luggage didn't make it to Lagos.  I'm not sure how common this is.  But, I was the one left chasing down their arrival and making arrangements for pick up over the days that followed.  If you're dates are flexible, and cost is important, check out Egyptair.  It's very competitive.  As for pet in cabin, ha, ha, no way!!!

"The tickets were VERY CHEAP, but I cold have had similar rates with QATAR or ETHIAD.
The crew was friendly, the food was not bad at all, but the condition of the plane was unacceptable: many seats not working (leaning back because they could not block in upright position), a overhead compartment door would pop open every now and then as it could not lock shut, the bottom of one or our seats was worn out creating a hole. The plane was near full, so there were no options to move to. At the back there were a few rows of fee seats, but the crew told me this is reserved for ""tour"" passengers... Whatever that means? Later I found that people where using 3 seats to sleep there. Good for them, but not so good for the passengers who had only one seat and it was defective. And last but not least: in 2016 an intercontinental flight with no individual screens...
For the connecting flight to Paris (MS799) the airplane was newer and they had the screens, however only one of the 4 seats we occupied had a working entertainment system, the other 3 would freeze every few minutes requiring restart of the movie/music: so basically unusable.

"Previously I have had no complaints when travelling with Egypt air, however, on this occassion, Egyptair have gone down in my estimation. Probably because of the low demand in Egyptian tourism, they are now putting on smaller aircrafts which have shabby worn seats many of which do not sit properly in the upright positions and they have a very nasty odour. The company seem to have no problem letting Egyptian passengers take on copious amounts of hand baggage thus filling up all the overhead lockers before 50% of the travelers have boarded. My friend and I were seated to the rear of the plane and we slowly made our way to the back of the plane whilst being held up by passengers trying to squash large amounts of luggage into small spaces. Finally, we made it to our seats only to be told that we would have to make the journey back to business class in order to store our one bag each. Needless to say, we were not offered seats near our luggage so we then had to proceed on the slow journey to the back of the aircraft once more. During this time the aircraft was unbelievably hot and stuffy, however, as soon as we took off the cabin instantly became very cold. Being a night flight most carriers offer blankets but not on this plane. The only evidence we saw of a blanket was wrapped around two members of staff who were sleeping across the three back seats on each side of the isle!!!
Of the guests on board there were just a handful off foreigners (maybe ten at most) and the rest were Egyptian. We noticed that the cabin crew were helpful to their own whilst we were left to struggle reaching into the overhead compartments to retrieve our bags.

In conclusion, I paid £411 for this one way flight and I truly believe I did not get value for my money. Based on this experience I would certainly think twice about traveling with Egypt Air in the future!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoreenH442,Doreen H wrote a review Aug 2016,Doreen H,SSH,33 contributions,12 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r401035299-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Value for money,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Egyptair is another airline that has room for improvement. As a National Airline they should have higher standards both concerning their flight attendants and service.
I have flown with them several times, mainly because they offer one of the most generous luggage allowances of any airline I know. and as i have travelled to Egypt to live and work, I needed alot of luggage.
The crew themselves were not 'on the ball' when it came to the safety procedures on take off and landing. Having been crew myself for 4 years for a British airline, I am quick to notice anything not done, ie: not checking seats in upright position and window blinds up for take off and landing,
The main meal service was edible, but the crew were not that friendly on most flights I took with them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracy20152016,tracy20152016 wrote a review Aug 2016,tracy20152016,"Marrakech, Morocco",71 contributions,40 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r401029575-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Best part is the baggage allowance,Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This review will not go into details and mention names, but it will just stick to the facts. On December 2016 I traveled from Athens, Greece to Bangkok, Thailand via Cairo with my wife. We returned early the next month.
When we arrived at the Eleftherios Venizelos (Athens International airport), we could not find one of our four suitcases. We had made a stop at the Cairo Airport and from there our suitcases where supposed to be transferred to the next airplane along with us. They told us that they were lost for some reason and that we had to fill out a specific form. Our trip was long and exhausting and now we had to stay standing in some line, who knows for how many hours, in order to do the “proper” paper work.
We canceled the transfer we had arranged from before, since we didn’t know how long this would take. Till now this seems something ordinary which happens almost every day to some airlines. Well, I am convinced that this is not the case, and that our suitcase was left behind on purpose, in order to facilitate some “function” which only this specific airline knows about. I am absolute positive that they left our suitcase behind on purpose since: a) I wasn’t the only one that lost my suitcase that day, the same thing happened to about 40 other passengers and b) miraculously ALL of the suitcases were found and send to our homes the very next day, each and every one of the 40 passengers! There’s no way that all of them were lost and found the next day, but nevertheless this is the “official” story from the airlines representatives on the destination airport that evening.
My problem was that I had forgotten inside the lost suitcase my homes’ door keys. Since I couldn’t know how long it would take to retrieve my suitcase and keys (there was no guarantee from the airline’s side), I rushed to find a lock smith as soon as we reached our home (by the way, it was getting very late). Thankfully we did find one but we had to spend about 3 hours in the cold staircase with all our other suitcases and of course we had to pay him a considerable amount of money for his services and our new lock and keys.
I consider this airline fully responsible for my adventure, so during the following days I wrote and send a letter (via email) to the airline’s head offices in Cairo. I got the proper email address after I contacted their offices in Athens first and requested initially an official explanation about my lost suitcase incident and furthermore I also requested a compensation for my expenses (locksmith-lock). I also forwarded copies of all the official documents (luggage handling documents and locksmith’s invoice) in order to explain my case in a clear manner. I have waited for one entire month, but there was no reply. I forwarded the email once more just to be sure and I waited for 10 more days. But still nothing from the other end. As a final attempt I called their Athens offices again and requested to speak with the “one in charge”. So I spoke to a lady and she just suggested to forward my email to her so she could have a look at it. She also assured me that she would try to do her best, although she mentioned that she “didn’t think that anything would happen” and eventually it would be very hard to get my money back. It was worth the try, but it turned out to be true, so nothing happened and I never got my money back, nor received an official explanation or apology. This is what bothered me the most, no one didn’t even bother to call me back for what happened that day.
If I hadn’t placed my keys in my suitcase (the first and last time I did this foolishness), I wouldn’t have bothered perhaps to write this review. I guess things like this happen to low prestige (and not only) airlines all the time. It’s the fact that they ignored me that made me still remember this unfortunate incident (after 8 months) and not to the fact that we had to pay 16 USD for a fast-food burger at the Cairo airport. But that again is another story…",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/45/07/a8/george-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Georgek,George K wrote a review Aug 2016,George K,"Athens, Greece",321 contributions,112 helpful votes,Bangkok - Athens,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r400934047-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Insufficient, Unprofessional and Untrustworthy!",Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently flew from LHR-CAI return. I would really advise allowing a lot of time at the airport before your flight. The check in was pretty chaotic at LHR with very long queues, in fact the queues were so bad people were cheering when they called the next person in the queue forward for checkin and despite arriving two and a half hours before my flight I only had 15 mins in the departure lounge before my flight was called.

The plane itself was very nice with better in flight entertainment than you would normally find on a similar medium haul flight. The cabin crew on both flights were absolutely amazing. They were very friendly and really worked hard to make everyone feel welcome, chatting and exchanging jokes with passengers. Definitely one of the most friendly crews I've seen with any airline.

A major issue was the time taken for luggage to arrive in Cairo. We waited around 1 1/s hours for our luggage to arrive, which meant I arrived at my hotel very late and didn't get much sleep before business meetings the next day. My hotel's shuttle driver suggested the delay could have been caused by the fact I was travelling on a public holiday and that though the wait is normally long, it is not normally that long.

The checkin for my return flight in Cairo for the return flight was much smoother than at Heathrow. Again though I would allow plenty of time at the airport though as security is very tight and it took me around two hours to pass through all the security and immigration checks. I didn't really mind as I would prefer to be safer.

I would definitely fly with Egyptair again in the future!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1cosmo,1cosmo wrote a review Aug 2016,1cosmo,"London, United Kingdom",63 contributions,59 helpful votes,London - Cairo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r400277994-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Excellent service but allow plenty of time for the extra security checks!,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is my second trip with Egypt Air and I am very disappointed with the lack of service. We were travelling with a 2 month old infant and were never offered to board the plane early. The airline staff at the gate made announcements very late and did not board passengers in an orderly fashion (by row # or zone). The gate was chaotic to say the least. Once we departed late and were in the air, the staff never informed us which washrooms had a change table, or even set up the bassinet for us (we had a bulkhead seat). We had to ask for both.

There were plenty of kids on this flight and mid-way two of the washrooms ran out of soap and paper towel. Kids had made a huge mess in the bathrooms with toilet paper everywhere and the staff did not attend to it, clean it up, or restock the bathroom. One child even vomited in the aisle and the flight attendants did not clean it up. The smell was absolutely terrible.

The staff did not come by often to offer even water, and did not attend to the call button when pushed. During taxi-ing, a couple of the flight attendants were busy texting on their phones instead of helping the passengers get buckled up.

I will not be travelling with this airline again.

"I flew in to JFK on American Airlines and they were late, so I missed my international flight on a Friday. I ended up being stuck in NYC over the weekend, waiting on the next flight out on Monday. Thankfully, I have family and friends in the area, so I didn't go broke on hotel fees (American Airlines refused to cover anything).

When I realized I wasn't going to be at JFK in enough time, I called EgyptAir to explain and to find out if there was anything they could do to help. Unfortunately, because of my baggage being on the incoming flight with me, they let me know there was nothing they could do. But, they told me I should come to customer service and try to make sure I could get on the next flight out. I was also made aware of the $300 change fee (that I maintain American Airlines should have covered) that I would be expected to pay.

I got there too late on Friday and called back (not customer service's number by the way). I was told a window of hours to come during the next day to change my flight and I did. Once the customer service guy heard me say I missed my flight with them because my American Airlines flight was late, he looked up the flight and told me he would talk with his supervisor to try to decrease the change fee. I ended up being charged $150, which was awesome.

Two days later, I returned to the airport 3 hours early. I had my baggage wrapped with plastic ($15 per piece) and then went to check in. At the counter, I heard the EgyptAir employee say something about window seats to another customer, so before I left, I asked about mine. I'd marked window seats, but hadn't been given them. The woman helping me quickly made the change for both flights and with a smile.

Boarding the plane was painless and the flight was smooth. I had a 12 hour layover in Cairo (which I took full advantage of) and boarded my second flight with the airline, this time headed to my final destination. This time, I had the great luck of getting on with the Egyptian national soccer team and meeting their players (including one that plays professionally). Since I'm a soccer fan, this was an awesome bonus for me. The team was actually headed to play Tanzania's national team.

The attendants on both flights were very nice and the food/drinks were pretty good. However, the plane for the first flight was a better plane as I was able to charge my devices while we were flying. Not the case with the second flight (which seems to be the norm on intercontinental flights) and is the ONLY negative I have to say, which isn't much of a negative. :-)

Overall, I would definitely recommend this airline to others and because of their awesome prices, will also fly with them again myself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheZuriExperience,TheZuriExperience wrote a review Jun 2016,TheZuriExperience,"Baltimore, Maryland",108 contributions,37 helpful votes,New York City - Dar es Salaam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r384636718-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Great Flight & Awesome Employee at JFK,Date of travel: May 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We took 2 flights connecting at Cairo, both were delayed, one was delayed for 1 hour and the other for half hour, both for no announced reason.

At the check in, we were asked to change the check in desk several times, because of system issue, and they were playing games without respect to anyone, as if travellers are sheep that are being herd.

The on flight entertainment systeme is as none, the seats were old, hence they were wide enough and somehow comfortable.

The transit time at Cairo was terrible, we had to wait for immigration officer as he was sleeping somewhere, and we were connecting from domestic to international, after he came, he asked us to fill some forms which we were not told about, extra delay.

The service men in the airport are acting like beggers, they ask you for money and help after you use the toilet or any other service, even when they clean the garbage.

The food court area, are dull and smelly, we went for one of the branded fast food restaurant to ensure cleanliness and standarisation, but we were mistaken for sure, the taste was not nice, and despite we were hungry, we couldn't finish our food.

"En route to Istanbul and then back to Johannesburg in May, we had a very pleasant trip all round. This is despite some of the travellers fears that an EgyptAir plane had just crashed a few days earlier. The Captain kept his passengers in touch, The crew were friendly. The food was airplane food but good. I had a special Hindu Meals and my friend the Seafood Meals - this was welcoming. In flight entertainment was good but I feel they can do more with their music play list but it was not a train smash! (air smash lol) For the price one pays and minimum stopver time, it does not warrant any complaining. Flights were on time.

"I usually prefer Egyptair for a number of reasons, being located in Cairo, Terminal 3 (the home base for Star Alliance) is much better than the older Terminal 1, it's my country's carrier and it's generally convenient.

I travel to London on business on regular basis, Egyptair has two flights one is on 737 the other, which I took is usually on a 777 or an Airbus A340. This was the first time to try the 777 and I was more than happy with everything.

The in-flight entertainment content was really up to date, the music selection was simply surprising, given that I'm very picky when it comes to music. Food variety and quality have improved dramatically and for the first time in a few years, an amenity bag in business class in Egyptair and it was very adequate and Chopard, wow!

All I can say is keep up the good work and I know that more can be done and that the magnificent experienced people at our flag carrier can do it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/bd/46/8e/mirox9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mirox9,Amir wrote a review May 2016,Amir,"Cairo, Egypt",123 contributions,75 helpful votes,Cairo - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r377444061-EGYPTAIR-World.html,A Very Pleasant Surprise,Date of travel: March 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've flown Egyptair for years, being an Egyptian, and i remember clearly when Egyptair was a not one of the good airlines, but over the last few years, they've upped their game quiet significantly. It's not Emirates or Etihad yet obviously, but being a very frequent traveler i promise you it is way better than Lufthansa, Air France, etc.  I usually travel business, so the differences from one airline to the other are quiet obvious to the naked eye - The chairs were comfortable and super wide (i'm overweight), lots of leg space; the baggage allowance is exceptional (2 max size bags, infants get a 10 KG bag as well as a stroller and basinet) The staff is very polite and helpful; and the cherry on top is that on this specific trip the landing was outstanding! i could hear other passengers pointing it out too!

"Last Autumn I booked 2 return tickets for my wife and I.  In February this year I received an e-mail saying we could upgrade to Business Class, which we did and was told we would received an e-mail stating if we had been upgraded closer to departure. The night before an e-mail arrived stating ""we are unable to provide an upgrade"". No reason was given, then when we arrived on the plane ALL 24 BUSINESS SEATS were EMPTY. We were very cross because we couldn't sit in business even though we had paid in February. This new online upgrade system is ""a rip off"" run by Optiontown, a partner of Egyptair.  It happened exactly on the Inbound flight and the Cabin crew were using the Business seats as an extension of the galley.  There was absolutely NO reason for us not having the Upgrades because the seats were available.  Egyptair/Optiontown should never offer upgrades when they know you won't be upgraded and they take your money, then refund you later. A warning to other passengers, never use Optiontown.

"This is a collective review for the last several international & domestic flights, over the course of 2013 - 2015, all of which were in Business Class.

Having read other contributors' reviews, I reckon I must be extremely lucky, in that, I've actually had excellent experiences on all of my recent flights with Egyptair and their domestic subsidiary, Egyptair Express.

Whilst the outside of the windows may, inevitably be scratched (I wonder if this is a result of abrasion caused by sand?), the cabins themselves have been clean &, generally, well maintained.

Legroom in international, short - medium haul - J-class puts most European airlines to shame; I'm not that short at 5' 9"", but I struggle to reach the footrest on the back of the seat in front (all recent international flights have been on their Boeing 738s), whilst the seats themselves have been of ample width (proper business class seats rather than normal seats with the middle blocked off).

In-flight entertainment, whilst not on a par with that offered by 5 star airlines has offered a more than adequate selection of films & documentaries for whiling away a 4 - 5 hour flight.

Food is a vast improvement over that offered, even 6 years ago, & is served on proper crockery, with knives, forks & glasses - nice white table linen & all. Sure, it's not up to the standard of, the excellent, catering found on their Star Alliance partner, Turkish Airlines, but they knocked Lufthansa into a cocked hat in recent years.

Even on the, very short, domestic hops to Upper Egypt, you no longer get just a cheese sandwich and a cake, served on plastic trays, but a 3 course snack (salad, open sandwiches & desert), served on the same diner service as used by mainline flights.

Admittedly, the food, welcome drink & extra 10kg baggage allowance are, pretty much the only extras gained for flying domestic business. The seats are exactly the same for both classes on domestic flights and there's no IFE, but this follows the increasing trend amongst European carriers & is no real issue for a flight that lasts only about 1 - 1.5 hours.

Crews have been much more attentive than many report, doing regular water runs & not just disappearing to the galley for the whole flight; many have been smiling & seemed anxious to make a fuss of what seemed to be the only foreign passenger on some domestic flights.

As for it being a dry airline, much though I do like the occasional drink, I'm not going to get up in arms at having to endure a few hours making do with, rather pleasant, fruit juices.

I also quite like the reading of a verse from the Quran that is played before international take-offs, which sort of puts you in the mood for where you're going.

Baggage allowances, with the exception of the, newly introduced, ""economy light"" fares, referred to elsewhere, is generous in the extreme, at 2 X 30kg for international J-class, but do be aware that, if you break your journey, for a stopover, this is reduced to 1 X 30kg, for the domestic flights. However, it is possible to prepay for an additional bag, online, at a reduced charge to that due when paying excess baggage fees at check-in.

I don't criticise airlines for delays, as these are often the result of factors outside their control, related more to airport operations, than the fault of the airline.

Customer service, certainly from their Kensington office, has always been most helpful and efficient.

The only problem I've actually had in recent years is that of flight consolidations, due to low domestic PAX numbers, resulting from the dearth of tourists. Whilst often causing last minute changes in pre-booked transfers, at the destination airport, which can be frustrating, I'm realistic enough not to expect an airline to operate a near empty flight.

Overall, I would recommend Egyptair as a carrier for those visiting the country.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/4e/b0/12/gparrymanchester-uk.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GParryManchester_UK,GParryManchester_UK wrote a review Apr 2016,GParryManchester_UK,"Horwich, United Kingdom",3089 contributions,46 helpful votes,Manchester - Cairo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r365157334-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Multiple Flights with no Issues & Notable Improvements,Date of travel: August 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have been flying Egyptair since 2003 from London and Montreal. When the airline became a star alliance member services and the aircraft really improved quicklyCheck in at the airports is always friendly, helpful and efficient, regardless where you from from.Staff:       Egyptair staff and crew have always been exceptional and excellentAircrafts: They are new, clean, with great choice of in flight entertainmentFood:      The food needs some improvement and needs to be consistant. The flight                 from London the food was fine, it was not that great on the flight back to                London. I think some one put two bags of salt into everything.Suggestion:I do understand that Egypt is an Muslim country and many people fly through Egypt to travel to Mecca for the Haj.However, I don't understand why they do not offer beer or wine or drinks for those who ask for it. It is after all an international airline with those from other nationalities who do like beer or wine when they eat dinner.Since people are generally coming to Egypt on holiday, Nile Cruise, Group travel, to the Sharm El Sheilk etc... it would be a nice touch UAE, Qatar, are far stricter then Egypt and their airlines serve drinksAnother big difference with Egypt Air Emerites, Qatar And  Etihad is that Egypt Air actually hires Egyptian Cabin Crew and Ground Crew. The other mentioned airlines have no nationals on their own airlines.In flight magazineUsed to be well written however on this trip the articles were written by amateurs not writers and in most cases it  sounded as if the writer and not even been to the place he was writing about. The article about London could have been written by some one who googled London. There was no real sense of being there by any of the articles.

"I was heartbroken during my recent flight with Egypt Air. I flew a couple of times during the past few months and I am very keen about service and the entertainment on-board. Service was OK, nothing special, almost didn't feel like we've got service crew on-board after the meal was served. It was a dry flight, first time I boarded on a dry flight actually and the only entertainment there was are 2 movies, spectre and hunger games mocking-jay and the rest was very old.

Then flying back to Dubai on a smaller aircraft was a total disappointment. No entertainment screen and there's nothing to do but WAIT till it reach Dubai.

Sad and disappointing however I think that's the price I paid for flying on a cheaper rate.

The business class seats are probably the worst I have ever sat in, backrests that fall back when you try to recline; tray tables that are damaged loose and unsafe.

Food!! Best take your own!
Drinks!!! Why an earth in this day and age do you have an Airline that dosent serve alcohol.(please no-one say its for religious reasons)
The best is still to come!
They make you listen to a prayer before you take off ""Are you Serious""
Then to top it all they want you to roll up your blanket and place it behind you back for Landing, for anyone thats not aware! Thats the crash position OMG

"First time trying this route via CAI from FRA to CAI. Was really better than I thought and the price tag was half of a direct flight at time of booking.
Aircraft was full on the leg from FRA to CAI but then from CAI to JNB it was only half full. Obviously due to off-peak season.
Anyhow the plain was OK in condition and the service plus food good for economy class. The entertainment program had a lot of choices also in German language.
Stopp over time in CAI was OK in terms of duration not to be in a hurry and be sure that the luggage does stay back.
Only make sure that you do the leg from FRA to CAI also with Egyptair and not with LH to have two pieces of free luggage which is quite nice for economy class.
Service personnel was OK, nothing special.

"Small Embraer 170 plane was probably half full. Good legroom in economy altho seating laterally a bit tight - minimal elbow room for two people esp if you wanted to read or work. Cabin crew were efficient getting the food and drink around but unhelpful with passenger enquiries - e.g. which type of immigration card was required.
Limited soft drinks selection. Food was largely worst kind of airline food outside budget airlines - rubbery chicken, some sort of salami concoction, plastic cheese and tasteless breads.
In-flight information from cabin and crew almost non-existent.
Prompt departure from LCA and arrived on time. But plane stood on tarmac at Cairo for 15 mins until the door was opened as the bus to transport us to the terminal had not arrived - maybe more the fault of the airport authorities than the airline, but no explanation given by the crew which just frustrated people.

Whilst in the air I said to the Air Hostess could we have some Champagne or an alcoholic beverage to celebrate New Year - it was then to my horror that I discovered that this Airline does not serve alcohol!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/22/1c/6f/d5/kelvinwilliama2014.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvinwilliama2014,kelvinwilliama2014 wrote a review Mar 2016,kelvinwilliama2014,"Istanbul, Turkey",2272 contributions,196 helpful votes,Cairo - Amman,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r352801585-EGYPTAIR-World.html,DRY FLIGHTS ON NEW YEAR'S EVE,Date of travel: December 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"There is much progress happening with this airline. Mush better food and quantity. Reasonable price. A bit crowded but it's ok. Very good Pilot and quality of flight. Crew are welcoming but need to be more dynamic and to keep the smile on their face all time.

"We had the same size plane flying to Luxor and flying back from Cairo to London, it is totally unsuitable for a 5 hour flight, seats are very small, and extremely uncomfortable. Flying to Luxor all staff were courteous and helpful, unfortunately on the return trip from Cairo to London it was a very different story, the plane was almost full in economy and about 6 people in business/first class. I needed the toilet and there was a queue of around 10 people for the toilets at the back of the plane, because I have Crohns disease, I went to walk down the plane to use the one at the front as no one was waiting to use this one. I was stopped by a member of the crew that was not working but a passenger on this flight, he told my husband we had to use the toilets at the back as the one at the front was for the 6 people sat in first class, I had my need a toilet card but the crew member wouldn't even acknowledge I was even talking, he just kept saying use ones at back. He was rude and aggressive, even the Egyptian gentleman sat next to us said we should complain, they then tried to lie saying the toilet at the front had a queue, when you could clearly see there was no one using it . The aircon above the seats didn't work so it was over hot and a lot of people felt dizzy, a few asthmatics on board had to use their inhalers as the staff sprayed the cabin. It a shame that this is the treatment people get from Egypt air, it doesn't exactly make people want to visit the country. I for one will not be using Egypt air again. On a good note, the food was very good, and the female crew were polite.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/70/5b/e1/paula-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782paulac,Paula C wrote a review Feb 2016,Paula C,"Bournemouth, England, United Kingdom",96 contributions,82 helpful votes,Cairo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r349330799-EGYPTAIR-World.html,"Unsuitable aircraft, and worse staff",Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked online & found it easy to do, receiving fast & clear options throughout. A couple of days before my flight i received an email confirming the flight details & giving me the option to check-in online, I did this as i thought it would save me time at Heathrow.... however i don't think i would bother with this again as everyone else had the same idea & it would have been quicker just to go straight to the desk. The booking had a generous 23kg baggage allowance included at no extra charge. The hand luggage was 8kg instead of the normal 5kg (also helpful ). Food is also included free...amazing! The food was lovely, hot and enough of it ,including hot & cold drink. The seats were comfortable for both myself & daughter who is 6ft ( we didn't book extra leg room seats ). In flight films were played......another nice touch as some of the flight companies ceased showing films a few years ago! The staff were polite ,helpful & considerate throughout. All in all i would recommend this flight company without reservation.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marianw628,Marian W wrote a review Feb 2016,Marian W,"Bideford, United Kingdom",5 contributions,3 helpful votes,London - Luxor,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729067-r348295730-EGYPTAIR-World.html,Extras included.,Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I shouldn't complain but this particular flight where I hadn't paid for extra legroom
left me next to an enormous Egyptian man who managed to spread his elbows onto
my waist both as I was trying to eat ( impossible ) & all the flight. However to compensate
the lunch was unexpectedly quite decent & strangely in this terrorist world they give
steel cutlery to eat with - plus cushions & a blanket when you get your seat .

"I have a Gold star alliance card so I am given access to the Egyptair lounges in Cairo airport. The ones I have visited are in Terminal 3.

Red faux leather seats, bad food, non functioning coffee machines and no possibility of getting alcohol.

"This flight was on an A330 from London to Cairo.  It was a very pleasant flight experience with comfortable seats, good seat pitch, and a decent entertainment system.  The plane was relatively new, clean, and everything worked well.  The food was of decent quality and taste and the flight attendants were friendly and generally had a smile.  Their baggage service seems to be pretty good; they were able to make a quick transfer of my luggage when my flight arrived late.  I should note that it's pretty easy to connect flights at the Cairo airport; the signs are in English and the different gates are well-marked.
