"I have been compelled to join TripAdvisor just to write this review. To give some background, this flight only had 8 passengers and was travelling from Seychelles to Male, Maldives - a 3 hour flight duration.

Around 45 minutes into my flight I pressed the service button to ask for some water. After 25 minutes of waiting I walked to the back of the plane in search of water to find 2 cabin crew covered up with blankets ASLEEP ( see photos). There were no other crew present in the economy cabin for the duration of the flight. I could freely wander the cabin, access doors etc with zero supervision at the rear of the aircraft.

With 1 hour remaining the sleeping crew woke up and went to the empty business class cabin, closed the curtains and enjoyed breakfast with the rest of their colleagues. I peered through the curtains in disbelief. When I saw they were eating a croissant in addition to their continental breakfast I asked if I could have one for my son. I was told they were for the captain only and the cabin crew had taken a few of his stash.

Air Seychelles left a lot to be desired, awful service and unsafe experience.

"I would strongly advise anyone traveling to the Seychelles to avoid this airline. We booked flights for our honeymoon more than four months in advance, and were shocked to discover that Air Seychelles changed our flight time at the last minute by 10 hours, without notifying us directly. The first ""notice"" they gave us of the change was a generic ""Flight Reminder"" email four days before the trip, which did not explicitly note the time change. There was no text message or separate email noting the change, and by then it was too late to change our plans.

We've been struggling to get a refund from the airline, and they seem to have no interest in acknowledging or correcting their mistake. I've never had another airline change a flight time by so much -- from evening to morning -- without explicitly notifying passengers.

For travel to the Seychelles, I'd strongly recommend taking Emirates instead. We were forced to buy last-minute tickets at the airport, but they were incredibly helpful and kind in dealing with an unpleasant travel interruption.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harrisons398,Harrison S wrote a review Sep 2022,Harrison S,,1 contribution,,Johannesburg - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r862322321-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Horrific service from an airline that doesn't seem to care about its passengers,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travel regularly on this flight since more than 2 decades, and I am happy to start reviewing my experience on TripAdvisor to give more echoe to my experience. Air Seychelles may not be as big and pompous airline as the others, but it is the sweetest with one of the best customer services. Check In was seamless at Mauritius airport with Jessen and his team offering a most helpful and smiling service. The flight itself was stress free with a very professional Cabin Crew. Jerris was a very able Head of Crew onboard and was not only looking after the Business Class passengers (as it so often happens on other fights) but came back to chat with the Economy passengers, having a nice word for each one. Tessy was simply lovely always with a smile and well-wishing gesture. She was so attentive to details and was so natural in her approach that everyone felt so much at ease. Christopher, the young steward at the rear of the cabin was as helpful and available as Tessy. Keep it up guys, you are showing to all your other colleagues and your hierarchy that being a Cabin Crew member is not just to open and close the door, not just to be ostentatious and far-reaching, not being big-headed and unreachable. Keep on being simple, courteous and human. I hope that the Management of Air Seychelles recognises that the Cabin Crew is the real shop window of the company and that in the thrive to take off from the major crisis it was in just months ago, that the importance of the Cabin Crew is vital to this redress and that they need encouragement, better work conditions and a better treatment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardramasawmy,Richard Ramasawmy wrote a review Sep 2022,Richard Ramasawmy,,6 contributions,,Mahebourg - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r861470463-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Lovely Cabin Crew with caring service,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I would never ever recommend Air Seychelles to anyone.

I flew from to Mauritius with a large suitcase as I am travelling for a long time. My suitcase did not arrive in Mauritius, Air Seychelles was entirely unhelpful and unresponsive (they suggested I go back to Tel Aviv to look for my suitcase myself, although I don't live there and don't plan on returning there), and as far as I can tell have made no effort to find my suitcase.

They do not provide a form to claim compensation and seem to make it intentionally difficult to begin the claim process.

At this point it seems likely I will need to take them to court to recover the value of my lost (or stolen) luggage.

I understand that luggage is sometimes lost by airlines, however the handling of this by Air Seychelles is significantly worse than any other airline. I don't believe they make any effort at all to recover luggage that they lost, and have no regard at all for their passengers.

"We were booked on a one-way flight from Praslin to Mauritius (PRI-SEZ-MRU). The checkin in Praslin was pretty smooth. The lady told us that our baggage is directed to Mauritius, nothing to worry about on Mahé. Great news!

After arrival we had to checkin again as the second flight was international. At the counter I mentioned casually that we only have two backpacks as carry on as our checked baggage is transferred to Mauritius. ""No that is not possible"" we were told. ""You have to pick it up at the baggage claim and check it in again."" After some discussions I went back. Luckily a met a couple from the UK that did the same trip as we did. Same problem there.

We found an Air Seychelles employee, explained the situation, gave her our baggage tags we got earlier at Praslin and followed her back to the counter. They were having an argue. Unbelievable. Both flights operated by one airline that does not know their internal procedures and processes. After we were told that the baggage is transferred to Mauritius - surprise surprise - the real problems began as my girlfriend was traveling with her wheelchair that comes with electrically powered wheels.

We showed them the necessary IATA certificates and technical specs as we always do in that situation around the globe with many airlines. Airlines are generally not pleased to transport batteries in the cargo area due to potential risk of fire. But in this case the batteries are an integrated part of the wheels. You cannot take them off without taking off both wheels completely. So as usual they checked everything and let us finally continue. So far so good.

After boarding was finished the captain announced that we were actually early some minutes. Great news again. But suddenly the lady from the check-in appeared at our seats to tell us that the wheelchair will not be transported by Air Seychelles because an approval was missing. What the...?!

We had no idea what she meant. As I already wrote we had shown them the papers. And by the way we had sent the all the documents five days ahead of the flight as requested by Air Seychelles. We never got a reply to that email.

They still insisted an approval was missing. Just to mention again: No issues with the same airline on the first flight segment before...

However three to four employees were discussing at the aircraft's door. After 30 minutes the captain explained the situation to all passengers via speaker. He said they are organizing the missing approval and are waiting for it. Again: What missing approval and how are they organizing it by themselves when the complained that we did not bring the approval. Simply does not make sense at all.

After an hour I accidentally could observe a guy walking right next to the aircraft carrying the wheelchair's wheels with the batteries. Minutes later we took off without further information.

After arrival in Mauritius we found the wheelchair in parts lying on the floor in front of the special baggage counter. Some idiots bent one of the shafts that connect the wheels to the chassis. Without any tools and with pure force I could barely fix the shaft. Otherwise our trip had ended at this point.

We have never ever experienced that kind of discrimination against people with disabilities anywhere on the globe. Totally unprofessional and completely intolerable.

The Seychelles are probably the most beautiful places we have ever seen on earth but Air Seychelles is a catastrophe.

"We flew from Mahe to Praslin at 3pm in one of their tiny plane.
As the plane was full, they could not bring all the passengers luggage on the plane.
When we reached in Praslin, they told us that the luggage would arrive by the next flight we had to wait for...
On the next plane, no sign of our luggage.
They then said, you should wait for the next one, meaning another 30 minutes wait in the heat of Praslin airport.
I suggested them to ring to see if our luggage would indeed be onboard.
They apparently tried, but could not reach anyone.
As you may well expect, still no luggage in this second plane.
They finally told us we should go and would deliver the luggage to our hotel, but could not tell us when...
At worst at 9pm on the last flight.
To top it all, you have to leave with them your original ticket receipt, so you are actually left with no proof that you even had some luggage with them.
People in Praslin airport were not helpful and did not really care much about the situation.
As Seychelles tries to promote high-end tourism they should also gear their national airline to this level !

And if you dont get up and go ask for water, you dont get. Air hostesses hid at the back, never once coming round after the meal service, offering anything else. Did not hand out SA entry health screening forms, which should be standard practice. We had to ask, 3 times! Their seystream streaming service is poor quality, I tried watching a movie then a series, but left both, as it kept on glitching. And our check-in in Seychelles was an effort as well, the clerk helping us was uninformed and very lackluster. I would advise a different airline, but Seychelles is lovely. Dont put a damper on your island holiday before it even starts, fly a different airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacor407,Jaco Robberts wrote a review Mar 2022,Jaco Robberts,,2 contributions,,Johannesburg - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r831832147-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Poor service,Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew Air Seychelles on the 18th September, flight HM 1124 and then back to South Africa from Maldives with Flight HM123 on the 26th September 2021. We opted for Air Seychelles to travel to the Male, Maldives as it was a direct flight (9 hours) with just a refueling stop in Mahe, Seychelles as opposed to the long layover flights elsewhere.The takeoff and landings were pretty good but that was all that was good about this airline. Having travelled with the big 3 Middle Eastern airlines, I know what good customer service is about and where Air Seychelles was just down right bad.Things to improve/were not good and tips:•            Communication! There was no heads up or communication from either Air Seychelles or my travel agent, that passengers needed to bring headsets in order to watch movies on your OWN DEVICE  Considering this was a 9 hour flight, it was just unreal that this wasn’t communicated and most people couldn’t even access or watch anything either because of no headphones or the wifi on board for streaming was terrible!P.S Please bring with you headphones as you’ll be bored over 9 hours!•            The food! As many have mentioned, the food quality was terrible and it happened to us 3 times, where we sat in the first few rows(1st flight) and the middle row (2nd flight) and by the time the food service came, there was only one option left. This happened 3 times and not once did the cabin crew try and serve people who missed out the first time first, in order to have a choice! They couldn’t even meet dietary requirements!!•            The flight back to South Africa from Maldives (HM123 on the 26th September 2021), was delayed for more than 2 hours and the airline didn't even provide any meal vouchers like the other airlines  did. Extremely disappointing!•            The cabin crew are poorly trained and have little customer service etiquette. On our trip from JHB to Male via Mahe, our seats that were booked to sit together as a couple couldn’t be fulfilled? We had to then sit on opposite sides of an aisle and were promised that when the plane lands in Mahe for refueling, we’d get the seats that a couple who were getting off in Mahe. The cabin crew ignored these even though this was communicated to them and one opportunistic person who was sitting next to his wife and kids, took all 3 seats for himself. This deprived us of seeing the beautiful Maldives from the air.All in all, please take note of the above as we’d rather take a layover with good service than travel with this substandard service airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/1d/c7/53/mohbeen07.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mohbeen07,Mohbeen07 wrote a review Oct 2021,Mohbeen07,"Johannesburg, South Africa",180 contributions,84 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Male,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r813501444-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Sub Standard experience,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On 4 September 2021 we boarded flight from Maldives to Jhb via Seychelles.  Firstly the check inn was a disaster.  We stood there for ages waiting to be checked in.  Taking into consideration this was a 9 hour flight, we were only offered something to drink twice, once from Male to Seychelles and once from Seychelles to Jhb.  I had my service light on for more than an hour but no cabin crew to assist anybody.  I eventually stood up and went to fetch myself a bottle of water which was situated behind the last row of seats on the floor.  The cabin crew were not available to assist anyone on that flight, my friend requested a second glass of wine and was told no there is nothing left,  Meanwhile my husband stood up to go to the toilet and the cabin crew were having a huge social gathering / party behind the curtain and he stood there for a while whilst having a chat to another passenger and he realised that the staff and pilot / assistant pilot were sitting behind the curtain consuming alcohol. No second glass of wine for my friend but your air hostess was standing with a full bottle of wine in her hand.  Your airline staff from Seychelles to Johannesburg need some serious training in passenger etiquette as they are rude and arrogant and make you feel as if they are doing you a favour by serving you.  From check in until arrival in Jhb the service was just a disgrace.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller0409,Bianca wrote a review Sep 2021,Bianca,,1 contribution,8 helpful votes,Male - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r808709677-Air_Seychelles-World.html,WORST FLIGHT EVER,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dreadful Customer Service

I booked a ticket with Air Seychelles via their own website on August 3, 2021 from Johannesburg to Seychelles. For the leg JNB to SEZ I booked a restricted business class (P) while on the flight back SEZ to JNB I booked a fully flexible business class ticket (J class).

An hour into the booking when I wanted to confirm the hotel, I had to find out that the last hotel room at the hotel was booked / sold out and only significantly more expensive suites were available. I hence emailed customer service 1 hr after the booking was made to request if the ticket would be refunded. In europe but also the US it is common practice that within 24 hrs, even for restricted economy fares, airlines have a grace period where you can refund any ticket booked. airlines need as a matter of fact by regulation allow either a free of cost reservation for 24 hrs or alternatively refund tickets within 24 hrs free of charge or penalties.

I got an email back from Customer Service (Kelly) stating that the ticket would be allowed to rebook but that the refund value would only be 41 Euro of approx. 1.500 Euro ticket price. I replied back that while I appreciate the offer, I do not wish to rebook the ticket but would ask to refund the ticket or partially refund the ticket in J Class which was flexible.

I did not get a reply - not to my follow up email from August 3 nor from August 4, 5, 6. What is worse is that the airline phone number +248 4 391 000 is not reachable from Germany.

Independent of this, the airline states in its refund policy: Refunds may take up to 6 months to process. - this tells you a lot about the airline financial situation.

I can only advise travellers NOT to book with Air Seychelles and use alternative carriers instead - the practices demonstrated are against what other airlines practice. The fact of not responding to inquires and not being reachable is not acceptable to me.

From previous travel with Air Seychelles I can also confirm that the airline seats and service definitely are far behind those offered by other airlines serving this beautiful destination such as Emirates, Etihad or others.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TvdD,TvdD wrote a review Aug 2021,TvdD,"Larnaca, Cyprus",20 contributions,24 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Victoria,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r802099623-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Disappointing Customer Service and Experience,Date of travel: August 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We travelled from Johannesburg to Male via the Seychelles with travelling time of 9 hours . The cabin crew is rude and unfriendly, and respond to requests as though it is a huge inconvenience. The food was substandard, and once the food service reached our row (19 and 17), there were no meat options left. They ran out of wine on the return flight. The airline does nothing special for kids and is not child friendly. My biggest gripe is the entertainment system. You need to use your own devise and bring your own headphones. There is not a large selection of movies, and once you do manage to connect to the system, it buffers every few minutes or kicks you out and you need to login again and start whatever you were watching from the beginning. On a 9 hour flight, the least they can do is sort out the entertainment system as I didnt even manage to finish a single movie!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/3f/98/a9/desire-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesireG36,Desire G wrote a review Jun 2021,Desire G,,10 contributions,8 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Male,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r793437552-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Very disappointing,Date of travel: June 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have contacted the airline and have received no response except that my bag is considered minor damage and they will not take responsibility, so this is to ensure that everyone is well educated before using an airline that does not care for your health, safety or belongings:
I would like to bring to your attention our experience with Air Seychelles. This was our first time using the airline and we were quite excited for our journey to a once in a lifetime trip to the Maldives.
Unfortuantly our expectations were not only not met but they were way below sub-standard.
I spent 5 years working in the airline industry for a global airline and feel the service recieved was not up to par.
Firstly we were informed that we would be staying on the aircraft in transit from Seychelles to Maldives but once on board the aircraft this was not the case, which was not an issue as I understand we were to go to the transit lounge while the aircraft was cleaned. we had onward tickets already and informed our luggage would be passed through.
Our first shall we call it a hiccup, happened when we were escorted to the transit terminal. Understandably they need to check documentation but at this stage we were herded into a room with no ventilation or aircon and made to stand for nearly 2 hours since the ""system"" was offline, during this time passengers with children were allowed to go through and their passports were taken but for the rest of us we had to just stand and wait in a terribly hot room with no toilet or water access after a 5 hour flight, once we eventually got the front it seems as the tickets that were issued were no longer to be used. We then managed to get through and our flight was boarding well past it's intially take off time meaning we were late to our arrivals. also once through there was no time to get something to drink or use the lavatories since the plane was already boarding and low and behold nothing was communicated to the parents who had previously gone through nor that the flight would not leave with out them. I thought this is just a snag and covid policies dragging out the process but a little aircon, water and some communication on what is happening goes a long way.
Once arrival from a 2 hour boat trip to our hotel and after checkin I went to unlock my bag and it had been broken into, once I checked all contents noticed a pair of sunglasses were removed from their case and all my belongings rifled through.
Since it was only the lock that was popped and the luggage sealed I never noticed on arrival.
I then emailed my travel agent and once I recieved her reply to contact the airline I did so.
After confirming your policy on the website to report at the airport or report after leaving the airport as per below from your website:
""If you discover that your baggage and/or its contents are damaged and report it prior to leaving the airport, you will be in possession of a Damage Property Report (DPR). If you report it after leaving the airport, please contact Air Seychelles in writing, along with supporting documents within 7 days of arrival. We will assess the claim and notify you accordingly. For any baggage enquiries, please contact your local baggage services office on mhlbag@airseychelles.com""
Apperently this process hasn't been communicated to the staff since the refused to help me with this report as ""it can only be done at the airport""
Since my last communication with them on Tuesday 15 December 2020 there has been no furthur feedback and this causes a great issue as I can neither claim from my insurance for the damaged bag nor the sunglasses.
In addition to this the journey home was not a pleasant experience as once again the ""system"" in the transit lounge didn't work making the flight delayed upwards of 2 hours meaning we landed back in South Africa after curfew making people nervous to travel home. there was once again no communication in transit on what was going on, no ventilation in the room and then we received 2 handwritten tickets for separated seats. Why the booking was not done all the way through to Johannesburg from Maldives astounds me but now I was angry. I then got revised seats but when on the plane there were rows available at the back. Also we were advised the last 2 rows were blocked out for quarantine which is fine if they were actually used, since we found out on landing in South Africa that there were indeed Covid positive cases on the plane not 2 rows away from us, putting us all at risk without informing anyone. I must say I am highly disgusted with the service received and extremely disappointed with the airline baggage and ground staff. The lack of communication and feedback is unacceptable and the lack of accountability for the luggage and non compliance with their own COVID policies is extremely scary. I worry if this same complacency is put into place with their safety and security protocols
I definitely do not recommend using them for transit to anywhere since all our transit experiences were terrible. Maybe it’s better if you just fly to Maldives but with the luggage and covid issues I would use the airline again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlysut,Carly S wrote a review Dec 2020,Carly S,"Johannesburg, South Africa",26 contributions,7 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Male,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r780129340-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Once in a lifetime trip ruined,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We have booked tickets for July 2020 from Tel Aviv to Mahe. The flight was canceled due to the crown. We were not told anything about the refund for the flight cancellation, although it is obvious that in such a situation the company should have done it. After I wrote a letter, we were told that we would receive the money immediately upon the resumption of flights. Flights to Tel Aviv were resumed, but the money was not returned to us. Then I made a request to change my ticket for June 2021. The answer was delayed for three weeks, but after my reminders they still answered that this was not possible. In such a situation, this is the best option for any company, but not for the Seychelles airlines. They do not offer anything and do not refund denbs for flight cancellations.

"I had booked a domestic flight with Air Seychelles from PRI to SEZ. Obviously, we cannot fly because our international flights were cancelled. Air Seychelles has published on its website an updated refund policy according to which we apply for a refund since our flights were booked before 1 August 2020. My travel agent asked me to ask Air Seychelles to inform them officially about the change in their refund policy, send me a confirmation that our flights are refundable or add a note to the ticket so the refund can be requested. Believe it or not, in over 10 phone calls and after sending dozens of e-mails explaining this very simple thing they have to do I have not received a single useful reply.

"Air seyshelles

We flew from Johannesburg to seyshelles Mahe in March. It’s a brilliant direct flight that takes about 5 hours. Great price off season at ZAR 9000 per person return. The downside it’s a badly timed flight that leaves SA at 2pm and arrives in Mahe, the main island at 9pm local time ( note there is a 3 hour time difference). To make matters worse it leave Mahe at 9am to sa. This means you looose 2 days of you island vacation for which you have to pay for accommodation. It baffles me why they would do this and wish they would change the scheduling to give passages best value for money.

The plane to seyshelles was old and dated. The tv screen don’t work, some seat panels were missing, cramped economy seats and toilets felt old. The return trip on A320-251N was the new plane and much better feel.

They don’t have tv anymore but your can loggon to seystream to steam movies to your phone. So make sure you have a fully charged phone and earphones.

Food is basic and I suppose ok for a 5 hour flight.

All in all, an ok airline for the benefit of the direct flight.

When we returned to Mahe from Praslin we have decided to take the flight instead of ferry. The price is generally slightly higher than the ferry but staying not far from the airport on Praslin this was the best decision. The flight time is 15 mins and you will enjoy spectacular views over Indian Ocean. Our luggage has arrived before us being surprisingly loaded on an earlier flight so it was waiting for us when we arrived on Mahe. This time we had a pleasant flight with Air Seychelles and we will use them again in the future but probably just on domestic routes.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/21/c3/80/61/mikiduta.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikiduta,Miki wrote a review Feb 2020,Miki,"Bucharest, Romania",10245 contributions,872 helpful votes,Praslin Island - Victoria,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r743698018-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Short domestic flight!,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled with air seychelles from Mumbai to Mahe and back. One on the new 320 neo plane and one with old 320 ceo plane.Mumbai to Mahe flight had breakfast included with veg option had Paratha and some gravy with a veg cutlet and non veg option had one chicken sausage and an omlette.
The Mahe to Mumbai had dinner with veg being a mix veg pie (not so good) and non veg had chicken wrap (again not good). The seat 18C had many issues, starting with screen not working, cup holder broken and seat recliner also not very smooth. had to manually push and pull the seat. Window glass did not offer clean and clear view with the old plane.
The flights were both on time and flying experience was ok ok.
One particular thing that air seychelles misses big time is, even when there were many business class seats vacant, no one was given a free upgrade. Almost all major airlines give free upgrades to cheer their passengers.
They asked to pay 20K per person one way for upgrades.

"Whilst the flight itself was good, despite being some 30 minutes late in arriving at JNB, arrived on time in Seychelles. The food offered was excellent and Air Seychelles is to be commended for that but, all else disappointing:
- Only offered one drink throughout the whole five hour flight.
- Legroom poor and worse than on the older A.320.
- Seats less comfortable than on the older A.320.
- The Wi-Fi IFE streaming is a disaster! They say you can use a laptop - just try it. OK for a smartphone or small tablet but the seating pitch is so tight, anything else is impractical.
- How irritating to be asked for an opinion of the the Wi-Fi service in the middle of the film you are watching the options are: take survey now, remind me later or No Thanks - none worked. The screen froze - never got more than a third into the film I was trying to watch. Never could reconnect again for the rest of the flight!
- Discussed with cabin crew who said that they have had endless complaints both on our flight but also on a number of other flights.
- Air Seychelles have made a bad choice with their IFE in an effort to cut costs.
- I pity a family of four who, unless they know beforehand, for ALL of them to have tablets, the five hour flight will be a grim experience for them and fellow passengers.

"Hi, I have recently travelled from Mumbai to Johannesburg through Air Seychelles with the family of 2 adults and 2 children:

HM - 261 Mumbai to Mahe
HM - 61 Mahe to Johannesburg

I had a very bad and worst check-in experience at Mumbai airport, Its first time in my life in my 14 years of international flying experience, very unfriendly check-in staff at counters(the guy at counter B10 and two other staff around this check-in counters), rude and arrogant behaviour with passengers travelling with families.
we had a very bad experience while checking in. The ground staff at the check-in counter were very rude, raising voice on the passengers and teach them how to behave! it's quite unprofessional and this was the worst behaviour of the staff we have ever faced. they made us weigh the whole check-in luggage and hand luggage more than 3 times and made us remove the stuff as one bag was weighing 7.1 kgs 100gms more in of the hand luggage even though our 4 passengers hand luggage was less than 26 kgs(4x7kgs)

We have mentally traumatised by this experience.

I will never fly with Air Seychelles in my life, even though I have to spend more for other airlines to avoid this kind of turma.

"The flights are often delayed, with no information to passengers. You can get offloaded and stranded with no one to assist. Trying calling and you will never get through to anyone.

I really dont mind the uncomfortable seats or bad food but an airline should not treat its passengers like this.(If they think you are Indian, they are even ruder).

"Like many international airlines the aircraft was clean with a well maintained interior. This said, the aircraft was a few months old.
In-flight service could be much better. Entertainment is extremely limited, seats not very comfortable,
Most of all, the attendants were slow, it felt like an eternity before the meals were served, and longer before the trays were cleared. Food servings well below what I expected; more likened to a domestic short haul flight.
On a long haul flight in a narrow body or single isle aircraft with a single set of bathrooms to the rear, it was frustrating seeing the crew oblivious to the more than a dozen passengers standing in a queue behind them while they continued their work at what I can only describe as a snails pace, only allowing us through once they had packed away and stowed the food carts; bear in mind that some of the queuing passengers were children.
I wondered how much better an Emirates or Etihad crew would make this airline!
Staff are the ambassadors of a business.
The passenger next to me asked for a cup of coffee... the cup was handed to her in one hand and the creamer, sugar and stirring stick in the other; a better attendant would have placed all the above on the open seat tray.

The external power source was under (and between seats) but it needed cabin crew to get down on their hands and knees! No signage or details on any information card.

"Air Seychelles is a budget airline - very cramped seats ( and I am not tall at all). The food was very nice but took very long to be served. All drinks are served by glass and not by the bottle/can due to space restrictions on the aircraft. With turbulance that can be tricky and I was forced to down my drink! No coffee or tea was offered unless asked for individually. No drinks/water was offered during the rest of the flight (unless asked for). Entertainment: None. Have a new wifi system that you can play through your own devices, which does not work all the time, I had to restart my phone and log in all over again 3 times during one movie. Very frustrating so bring your own reading material/movies. It did not work on my husband's laptop either. Only 2 toilets were available for 120 plus passengers. VERY small space. Business-class: won't waste my money as the only difference is a bit more leg space. I am sure the food and service might be better as well. It is the only direct flight to Seychelles so we don't really have a choice! We also could not check-in online the day before.

It was supposed to leave at 2.15am and only left almost an hour later.  At that time of the morning, they are playing upbeat calypso type of music which was very annoying.

Insufficient drinks (soft drinks poured from 1.5l bottles) and you will be lucky if you have get to consume soft drinks and whisky (seems only 1 bottle of each). Staff member (Emmie) knocked her beverage trolley into my 3 year old son and didn't care apologolise - other passengers were more concerned than any of the staff were. When I went to attend to my kids, she stood on my chair with her shoes on to access the overhead luggage compartment. The connecting flight was just as bad. Staff argued with my wife at high volumes because my 3 year old fell asleep on her lap and wasn't in his seat. Horrible small flight with even worse staff.

"We had to choose this option as this was the shortest and direct flight available for Seychelles. We honestly did not have any expectations, but it could not get any worse. En-route to BOM-SEZ the breakfast service was not edible and was without any hot beverage (coffee or tea is basic for any breakfast service). The crew was impolite and did not even smile. My wife and I was conveniently missed when the breakfast service was going on and was not even paid attention to even after pressing the call button (was served much later due to our efforts). While on SEZ- BOM the flight attendant served me and my wife first (no we did not order any special meal and the service for the rest started almost 30 minutes later) however when i informed them that 'my wife has not touched her food you may take it and use it for others', she curtly stared and said 'sir, service is going on' and did not bother to do anything about it. The crew disappears after the service and could not be located at the galley, there are not water bottles/glasses kept in the galley for self service. Only before landing one could ask for water after they reappear. No Personal TV and the same has to be accessed from our own phone/tab/i-pad with our own head phones.
Avoid if you can.

My colleague  and i booked via this airline to visit  India in June. We have regretted using such an airline. The most uncomfortable  seats. You cant even pass the person next to you to even exit the plane. The food was horrible . During the 16 hour flight attendants just came once  during meals time to offer you anything  to eat or drink. The staff were so unfriendly . Reaching  our  stop over at Mahe Islands i was in awe to such such a despicable  international  airport. Lesson hard learnt is never to try any airline. Just stick to Emirates. Even when we went to India in March and April  this year we flew Ethihad... all i can say is that they are absolute rogues.

When the person in front of me dropped their seat to sleep they were darn near in my lap (if I were a couple inches taller my legs would have been pummeled, the seat went back that fast so I would be very weary of this if you’re around 6’ or taller) and the entertainment screen didn’t pop out so I had to drop my seat to see the screen and get back some of that space.

When booking the ticket nine months in advance, I receive six times an email that some changes in the flight. It wasn't a big deal, there were only five minutes different, but how many times they'd change the hours.

For legroom, I can't complain. I am small and can stretch my legs comfortably. The flight departs on time, so it was all good!

It took 75 minutes to clear passport control on the way in (as we were the last of three consecutive arrivals) and there were simply not enough staff on duty.
Check-in on the way back was even worse. Utter chaos. Staff clueless. Passengers crying. And still a 60 metre queue just 65 minutes before take-off, when we finally got through - and we were near the front of the line (see picture).
Not that we had much time airside after that, but the airport lounge didn't accept Priority Pass or Lounge Key. And the Burger King couldn't supply milk with our coffee as the local milk didn't meet brand standards, or some such excuse.

Also, we knew other groups that were boarding the same flight as us by they were not shifted but they kept them on their same flight. Initially we were told it was due to system error and all 8pm passengers were shifted to 10 pm but if that was the case then how come we were the ONLY ones shifted?? Will never ever fly again.

"Our inbound flight to Mumbai went off without a hitch. I was actually in full praise of the airline as the flight from Johannesburg was broken up nicely with the small stop in the Seychelles. However, our return flight was a complete mess!
We were scheduled to depart Mumbai at 05:45 on 17 March. This meant we needed to arrive at the airport by 3am which we promptly did only to be told once we're at the airport that our flight has been cancelled. No explanation given, we were just told we'll be leaving the next day. The airline put us up at a nearby hotel but throughout the day there was not a single bit of communication except that we were going to be picked up at 23:30 for a flight leaving at 05:45 the next day (that meant an over 6 hour wait at the airport).
I had to chase after the airline via Facebook messages and emails, eventually to be told that we will have a further 24 hour delay once we reach the Seychelles! In total that meant a 48 hour delay! 2 completely wasted days!
The ground staff in Mumbai were exceptionally rude especially when it came to requesting the wheelchair for my Dad. They insisted I did not book it which was not the case because it went very smoothly on our inbound flight. They didn't rebook it when they changed our flight, just like they didn't update our meal preferences. All ok in the haste of the delayed flight but do not stand there and insist your passenger is incorrect.
Delays happen but when it is such a lengthy delay, the least you can do is keep your passengers informed without them having to chase after you. It's an already stressful situation (we didn't know when we'd get home) and Air Seychelles did nothing to ease the minds of their passengers.
And lastly, eventually, when we're on the flight the home, there was not an utterance of an apology.

"UNFORTUNATELY this is the only direct flight to Johannesburg, South Africa, therefor they have the monopoly and it is more expensive than flying to Paris! A 4 hour flight versus a 10 hour flight.

Exceptionally, when we flew in January this year, it was plain sailing, all planes on time! The previous 2 years, we have sat either at Mahé or at Johannesburg waiting for Air Seychelles, twiddling our thumbs, falling asleep. This is regularly, since this is our TURTLE AIRLINE.

Then when you complain, they successfully hardly knowledge or answer you.

I took a flight from AUH to Mahe island for a short vacation. The flight was empty and there were about 40-50 passengers on board. Since I was with a toddler they gave me a bottle of water which was a good gesture. But the experience on board was pretty basic and average. How ever on our way back the flight passed through massive turbulence where on time I thought that the flight is about to crash. When it comes to the price of the ticket it was nearly 2000dhs pp and that was damn expensive.

"I would advise everyone not to use Air Seychelles. I had the most terrible experience with them on my trip to the Seychelles.

Firstly my ankle was broken and my foot in a moon boat and they couldn't have given a damn. I asked if I could move to a seat with extra legroom and was just told that I could pay to upgrade to business class if I like. Not to mention that I had to wait in the queue like everyone else when boarding.

Our flight was delayed by over an hour. Fair enough. But when I arrived in Seychelles I waited for my luggage and it did not arrive. I had to go to lost luggage and deal with a very rude lady who told me that my luggage was left in Johannesburg and would be on the flight the following evening and be delivered to me in La Digue the next day.

So the day arrives that my luggage was supposed to be delivered and guess what no luggage. My mother phones the number they gave me and guess you can't get through to it.

After I eventually get though I have to deal with another rude person who tells me that they don't know where my luggage is and all they can do is send an email to Johannesburg. After this they put the phone down on me.

My luggage eventually arrive on the 5 day after my mother has phoned the OR Tambo and told them to check there email. No-one had checked the email. I had to spend to much off my spending money on buying clothes.

"This review only concerns the Air Seychelles ground staff in Mahé - we did not fly with them but with Turkish Airlines. However, the experience with the ground staff was so extraordinarily bad that it deserves comment.

Long lines of waiting people in front of the check-in-desks when four ladies from Air Seychelles ground staff finally arrived. Starting up the computers was a lengthy process and in the end there were major problems with printers so only some people got boarding passes. Fine, this happens sometimes. But usually things can be smoothed over if staff is kind and polite, explain why there are delays and so on. These ladies screamed at passengers, waved angrily in the air when passengers asked questions and generally ignored people. Quite extraordinary. I didn't see the lady at business check-in behave any better. In the end we were left without boarding passes for our connection (which caused major problems in Istanbul later on) and no apology. We were first at check in and the process took us just over half an hour.

"While flying from Mauritius to Mumbai via Mahe, we found that HM260 from Mahe to Mumbai was cancelled on 01.11.18.
The Airline decided to put us up at Mahe & also promised to take care of our onward domestic flight bookings from Mumbai. Details of our bookings were handed over & we were sitting thus pretty, waiting for them to take all necessary action.
While checking in on the next day (02.11.18), we were abruptly told that the onward bookings were our own liability & the airline was in no way concerned with that. This was a shock to all of us.
This resulted in loss for every passenger since by that time, it was too late to take any action to change our onward domestic bookings on our own, the flights having already left.
A more professional approach telling us that we should contact the respective airlines for changing dates of onward flights could have helped in minimizing individual losses.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/57/84/26/triadin55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triadin55,triadin55 wrote a review Nov 2018,triadin55,"Guwahati, India",85 contributions,37 helpful votes,Victoria - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r632670499-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Good.

"I'm standing in the Abu Dhabi airport at 3:04 AM having been told I couldn't get on my flight to London because they rescheduled my flight to the next day because in their opinion I would have not been able to make my connection to London.  I had no clue it happened until I got to the gate and they said I couldn't get on the flight.  Ethiad says they're sorry but there's nothing they can do because it was Air Seychelles that did it.  That means I now miss my flight from London to LA and miss my son's election night which is the whole reason for my trip.  I will forfeit $1,500 for my round trip to LA, $600 for three nights of hotels and miss my son's election night.  Ethiad says they can't do anything even though the  itinerary is listed as Etihad Air Seychelles.  They don't have a call center so there is no way to reach them.  There is another family that the same thing happened to with two little kids crying.  Seychelles compensation for this is a meal voucher - no alcohol.  Never ever fly Ethiad code shares or Air Seychelles.  This is a complete screw job because Air Seychelles wanted to save the $500 that Ethiad would have charged them if I missed the flight which would only have happened if they hadn't been thirty minutes late taking off because they were waiting for three passengers in Mahe.  Also no doubt because they didn't want to have to pay to put them on the next flight.  Do not fly them for your vacation!

It was truly an enjoyable flight having a comfy seat and updated movie on board. They will also give you instantly a blanket without even asking for it. We even also like the food.

"Absolutely disgusting. Horrific cabin crew. Rude. Uncouth.
And far far away from having any desire to please the consumer!
In fact forget pleasing, they don't give a sh*t about you.
I was travelling with an injury in my leg and had hence got myself a seat at row 6 which has the maximum leg space in economy class.
The seat was broken and would auto-recline.
I informed the crew, and the first response was to ""Raise his voice and justify by saying i cant help it you do whatever you can"".
I fail to see the need to use the tone that was used.
I was on my way back from an amazing holiday and AIR SEYCHELLES & IT'S HORRIFIC CABIN CREW, LEFT A SOUR TASTE.
PS: Would not be surprised if things never changed with this airline. The attitude of the staff was far from apologetic.

We flew economy for the two-and-a half hours journey in each direction on board an Airbus 320 jet (the airline has 2 such planes).

Comfort was perfectly fine for the short journey and we would have no hesitation in recommending the airline, which is managed by Etihad.
Between Mahe and Praslin, the other island we went to, we flew one of their little twin otters (capacity 17 passengers).

"I was flying to Johannesburg from Mumbai in Air Seychelles and I cannot believe that the airline is a partner with Etihad. The ground staff at Seychelles is inefficient and incapable of resolving any queries of the travelers. They take 45 minutes to check you in and issue a boarding pass. Further, the airport is small and not clean, hence it only makes sense to travel through Air Seychelles if you are staying in Seychelles. If you are traveling elsewhere, avoid this route as there are a lot of flight cancellations. My flight was cancelled and there was no solution offered for the same. They did not provide any assistance with regard to the ticket and connecting flights. The ground staff promised us a refund on the new tickets that we had to purchase and gave us a 'wrong' and 'non existent' email address to write on for the refund. No refund will be issued and there was no response from the team as well. Air Seychelles has a long history of flight cancellations which will disrupt your travel plans if you have connecting flights. If you are headed to Seychelles only, you have no choice but to opt for this flight. The food served in the flight is pathetic and the in flight entertainment is below average. You can look for a different airline for this cost. It is not value for money, not value for your time.

"My mother was very unwell post the loss of my father. She had fallen ill while on a trip to India and I had flown in to stabilise her and then fly her to SA to ensure she would build up her strength to be able to eventually fly back to her home in the US. The staff on board were supportive for the 1st sector but beyond awful on the 2nd sector from Mahe to Johannesburg. They did not help her board despite her being on a wheelchair brought on board via a skylift. They ignored her plea to eat at a different time to everyone else on board even though the long flight would have not presented a problem to accede to this request. The senior staff member sat in full view of passengers, did no service whatsoever and ater her meal timeously. Only one relatively inexperienced crew member did all the service and so  seemed to become aware near the end of a 4hr flight that my mother was a severely unwell passenger. This had me very worried when after 2 months she was going to do the return journey from Jnb to Bom via Mahe on her own. I sent a message to HQ in Mahe about my complaint, had a response from HO and my mother had a very attentive and caring crew on her flight back. We all make mistakes but remedying a mistake takes strong management and empathy.

"Travelled with air Seychelles I was hoping to get a good service as the plane is small and it was a short trip. The airhostest was nice but some of them was moody. A groupe of seychellois kids was traveling with us oh boy were they loud and rude. Now i kinda understand why the airhostest had the attitude. My son had a seat that was broken even we ask to be move that did not happen. Bo entertainement at all. I travelled with a 15yrs,11yrs and a 20 months old. My little one did not even get a souvenir but i saw them giving it away to other kids. As a Seychelloise im ashame of the service they offer and i strongly do not recommande air seychelles.

"Air Seychelles has a history and habit of changing and cancelling flights. In fact, they delayed ours from 9:45 am to 21:45 pm. Ok, we where informed a day before, but we lost a day and who will pay for our late check out, lunch and dinner at Seychelles (at Mauritius we booked an all-inclusive resort). Then, I tried to check in online; did not work. Next morning I wanted to upgrade our tickets online; did not work. Worst however was, that checkin took us 75 minutes, while there where only 15 people before us; the employees confirmed software problems. Aboard two passengers had the same seat assigned (23F). The plane was new, baggage allowance was 30kg, but those where the only two positive things we can say. Etihad partner? A joke.

"Air Seychelles is a very good airlines to fly in if you're looking to go to Seychelles or Mauritius from India. Their cabin crew was very courteous and helpful.

"First the positives. Very helpful and friendly staff who did their best under trying circumstances. Food was good quality. Staff at the head office in the Seychelles helpfully transacted my extra luggage payment prior to departure.

The negatives. Our flight from Abu Dhabi was delayed by 4 hours. The cabin was cramped and definitely not the standard you would expect from an international airline. There was not enough space to store all hand luggage. In fact many items were stored under peoples feet or was stowed in the food cabin loosely at the back of the plane.

Warning: check your luggage allowance before leaving. We had no idea that we were only allowed 1 item up to 23kg per person. We had to buy an extra 20kg for 80 US Dollars. This would have been double the cost had we found out at the airport. We had to call Seychelles head office in Mahe to purchase it.

Many people missed flight connections because of the delay and emails were sent out too late for people to change plans before arrival at the airport.

The airline only has 2 internationally capable aeroplanes which is two A330-200 planes. There is no way that this airline can claim the same international standard that most passengers would expect.

In a nutshell, Air Seychelles is cheap but you get what you pay for - a no frills airline - perfect if you want to travel to the Seychelles on holiday. But I would not recommend this airline if you are in transit to somewhere. More than likely you will miss connecting flights elsewhere. It is definitely not recommended as a flight to take young children with you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenzilC26,Denzil C wrote a review Jul 2018,Denzil C,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Abu Dhabi - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r597240682-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Fly Air Seychelles only if you holiday there!,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Landed in Mahé from London and needed to get to Praslin Island, and Air Seychelles operates frequent flights in little Twin Otter propeller aircraft.

Domestic terminal is a short walk from international arrivals. Check-in painless (2.5 hours before flight) and although technically, we were allowed only 2 bags, the cabin is small so a cabin bag had to be checked in too. No big deal, and no excess bag charge.

Waiting area/gate is comfortable. Flight is short and fun (you can see into the cockpit and out the window, so get a real sense of where you are).

Arrivals in Praslin as simple as can be.

"The plane covering the distance between the isles of Mahé and Praslin is a propeller light aircraft. The height inside the aircraft is rather reduced to such an extent that upon entering it one has to bend his back considerably in order not to hit the ceiling, but that’s not disturbing at all for once seated the comfort is similar to that regarding a bigger plane.
On the day I flew with that airline, 10.05.2018, the boarding was a bit delayed but that didn’t cause any trouble whatsoever. The same occurred as regards the return flight.
The flight lasts in general about twenty minutes and on the day mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph it went quite smooth as well as the landing. The views which can be beheld from the plane are fabulous. As it flies over some of the Seychelles Islands on good not cloudy weather some of them can be seen through the window, what is quite impressive.
The plane was clean and the crew members were friendly. The flight is therefore pleasant and one feels safe flying in the planes of the airline concerned.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/periandro,periandro wrote a review Jun 2018,periandro,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",7330 contributions,530 helpful votes,Victoria - Praslin Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r589238729-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Good experience,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We had to spend some of our holiday money which it sadly seems we cannot get back.  we allowed ourselves enough time to clear customs to catch the next flight, but due to the delay by Air Seychelles we it seems we will lose all that money.  will not fly with Air Seychelles ever again.....",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warroomdetenq,warroomdetenq wrote a review May 2018,warroomdetenq,"Durban, South Africa",1 contribution,,Johannesburg - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r577579747-Air_Seychelles-World.html,DELAYED FLIGHT - MONEY LOST,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The experience of flying in Air Seychelles was a decent one. The cabin crew is helpful and polite. The in-flight entertainment is actually good and the food served in-flight is delicious.

"Part of the cheaper flight back from New York to Johannesburg was to come via Seychelles from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg. This included about 1,5 hours in the airport on Mahe Island in the Seychelles. It did make the trip back longer, but cannot not really complain about the actual flights.

"Air Seychelles has decided (for a long time) to stop this year in April 2018 their direct connexion with Paris and all the long distance flights from Europe. They work already with Etihad for several years and all the long flights will pass by Abu Dhabi in the future.
That's why maybe the service was a bit lower in the last months and year.
Air Seychelles will concentrate its activity in the local flights (which are very practical and not so expensive).
You must know that the competition will be more active in the next years to go to the Seychelles from Europe : you'll find a new connection with Air France from Paris, a new one with British airways. And always connexion via Emirates, Etihad and Turkish airlines so check all the lines !
About the flight itself, Etihad which takes now the Air Seychelles flights have not the quality of Emirates for example. But the flight between Mahé and Abu Dhabi is surprising because you have large place for your legs in economy class. It's not usual.

"After the Business class flight from Abu Dhabi it was now time for the economy leg to Johannesburg. Before I get to that a quick mention about the transit at Mahe Airport.
What a shame for holidaymakers first and last impression of the Seychelles being their airport. A cramped and chaotic shambles. With so many international airlines flying there it surprises me they haven't got together and said this is just not on.
The departure area is just too small for so many flights, try and think back to small airports in the 60's and 70's and that's what you have. It is so bad it's put me off going there on holiday. Why pay 5 star prices for a holiday and put up with that?

"Booked economy, bid for upgrade to business class was successful.
I have to say I was a wee bit worried about a flight close to 5 hours being on a small A320 however I was very much pleasantly surprised.
Service, drinks and food were excellent. Flight departed just after 2am and I was also surprised when we were handed an amenity bag for a relatively short flight. On board entertainment is the same as on Etihad although the screen is a bit smaller. The seat does not go to flat but I'd say to 60% and you can find a comfortable position.

"When returning from Praslin for our flight back home, we chose to fly to make sure we made it on time and did not have to spend a lot of time on transfer on Mahe.
We feel it was a good choice, especially since the actual trip was an experience in itself.

The plane is small but feels very safe - and I have a fear of flying, I never flew something this small before. The logistics at the Praslin airport are very simple, but still full-featured.

The flight only takes 15 minutes but offers fantastic views of especially Praslin island. It also very handy to switch from the domestic to the international ""terminals"" at Mahe, so it does work to save time using this option of transport.

Try to have as little hand luggage as possible, you need to keep it in your lap or under the seat in front of you. There is no overhead room or other handluggage space in the cabin.

When arriving at Mahe, the luggage is delivered right inside the terminal door in a very small spot not clearly marked. Can be a bit confusing.

All in all a positive experience, but a bit expensive (about double the mimimum price of the ferry).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/75/0d/dc/dan-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danlG6101DQ,Dan L wrote a review Mar 2018,Dan L,"Stockholm, Sweden",177 contributions,20 helpful votes,Praslin Island - Victoria,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r568645515-Air_Seychelles-World.html,"Fantastic but short flight, highly recommended although a bit pricy!",Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had pre-booked seats at £30 per seat for each of 3 legs on a trip to Praslin in the Seychelles with Air Seychelles.  The outward journey was fine and myself and my travelling partner got the seats we had paid for.  However, on the last leg of the return flight, the longest leg, we were given seats apart and not the seat numbers we had booked and paid for.  As the flight was very full we did not complain at the time. However, when I looked at the booking it had transpired that the check-in desk at Praslin had made an error in not putting the booked seats on the boarding passes for this leg of the journey.  I have tried in vain to get a refund for the price of the booked seats (£60) we didn't get and I was fobbed off with all sorts of excuses why I shouldn't get a refund.  Air Seychelles customer relations are absolutely appalling and I will never fly with them again!

I realize that smaller airlines often purchase used planes but I would rather not fly on them. Bring your laptop as the TV service with complimentary ear buds does not work well. Don’t board hungry as it takes a very long time for flight attendants to supply a beverage or a meal and then a very long time to clear your tray. The flight itself was smooth.

"This flight lived up to Air Seychelles reputation for tardiness! Late arriving (45 minutes) and even later leaving (55 minutes). No realistic explanation! The boarding experience (Air Seychelles ground handling agent I suppose) was disorganised. Called to board, then waited another 15 minutes, all hanging around. Then down the corridor, only to be held up for another period for some unexplained reason, then to the entrance of the aircraft, where again another apparently unexplained delay before boarding. Seat was comfortable but one third of the leg room space is taken up with the IFE 'box' and on an A.320, this means cramped! Flight should have been on the more spacious A.330 but it was not to be. After 40 minutes into the flight I asked a stewardess why the IFE had not been started - she replied that this was due to a 'Passenger Announcement'. Does she think we frequent travellers (some 50 years!) can be convinced by such a nonsensical statement? It was an hour before the IFE was made available. There is simply no excuse for this on what is a five hour flight. With a small/tiny screen in the seat back, it was almost impossible for me, even with glasses, to read the tiny script or, even, the names of the films! Not good. After all this, I was in a thoroughly irritable mood - only to have this lifted by a surprisingly good meal and excellent drinks service. With no other airline serving this route directly, one is stuck with Air Seychelles but with more training and a commitment to on time flights etc., this would have been a reasonably good flight. Overall, disappointed!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellK524GY,Michael L wrote a review Jan 2018,Michael L,"London, United Kingdom",503 contributions,208 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r556526583-Air_Seychelles-World.html,"Late to arrive, even later/longer to depart, otherwise mixed views!",Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew to Mumbai in December and back in January with them.

We paid for seat selection in September, yet the airline moved my seat to favour passengers that did not pay for seat selection. This I find out on boarding only. I think that is utterly unprofessional and unacceptable.

The food is average. And be warned you will be given 1 drink with your food only. After that all hosts and hostesses disappeared.

Best take your own water or you will dehydrate.

Only 1 set of bathrooms worked on flight there. Overall the bathrooms on both ways was disgusting. You have to wade through the urine.

"Recently i took a flight from Seychelles by Air Seychelles to Mumbai

I had selected the airline because it had direct flight and it is partner with my frequent flier programme airline

.
i had bought the return ticket by paying full business class fare for the same.(without discounts)

It was the worst flight experience ever.

First at the business class lounge of Air Seychelles at Mahe airport for a 2225 departure time there was nothing to

eat. Generally people would like to eat at the lounge and sleep on the flight at such time.

on the flight in the business class there were two employees, one male and another female .Both of them were exceptionally rude, discourteous and unprofessional. Both of them did not know how to talk to a passenger. I think if one wants to be international airline something better is expected.

I asked for vegetarian meal and the female employee told me that since there was a special request in my name she can serve me vegetarian meal only if something is LEFT OVER.I told her that I had given preference for vegetarian meal and that's what I wanted. The same conversation was repeated by male employee.

Finally I had absolutely no food on, 2225 pm, four and half hour duration, night flight from Seychelles to Mumbai.

I had to remain absolutely hungry despite travelling on a full fare paid business class flight.

on the flight the inflight entertainment system was hanging every 5 minutes and no one could fix it..i believe few others also had the same issue. the quality of screens and movies was third rate reminding one of pre satellite, antennae televisions where one had more disturbance than the programme itself .

At the Mumbai airport baggage took ever for arrival. Sure enough the priority tagged baggage was last to arrive.
not a good experience to remember.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guhagar,guhagar wrote a review Jan 2018,guhagar,"Mumbai, India",9 contributions,3 helpful votes,Victoria - Mumbai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r550623521-Air_Seychelles-World.html,disappointing experience,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

you cant check in online from Johannesburg
Miserable staff from check in to unfriendly air hostesses. Food must have been made for previous flight as it was soggy and old.

They never notified people that flights to Praline were cancelled and we were to be put up in hotel .
Had to search Airport to find a staff member to find out what was happening.
Eventually left airport 2 hours later as two of the passengers luggage was lost.
At hotel had to inform the staff to give us water and cold drinks as they had no idea what we were entitled to.
Had to ask for breakfast as we were not offered.
Nobody from airline to look after the People.
Next morning connecting flight was also late.
On top of that was meeting a friend who was on the fight the next day and that was 4 hours delayed . he was not notified either .

"I booked a flight with Air Seychelles in January 2017 from Frankfurt to Antananarivo to visit a friend. The first flight was 1st of August, the second 1st of November.

On the 14th of July I received an E-Mail with a cancelation of my flight to Tana. As reason Air Seychelles named the cooperation with Ethihad has been canceled and so is my flight. There was no effort to offer me another flight or to contact me via phone. I had to call their hotline and persisted on taking that flight. After 15 minutes I had back my initial flight with stops in Abu Dhabi and Seychelles.

For the flight back I received another cancelation at the 20th of August for my 16 hours return flight with stops in the Seychelles (Mahe) and Abu Dhabi. This time the reason is the Pest in Madagaskar and the risk for the people living on the Seychelles. There was a case of Pest recorded on the Seychelles. Anyways other Airlines still have a direct connection between Antananarivo and Mahe (Seychelles) which makes me doubt about the usefullness of the cancelation.
Also this time there was no attempt to offer me another flight. They e-mailed me and thats it. I had to call again and asked for another flight.
I got offered a 32 hours flight with a night in Mauritius, Stops at Seychelles and Abu Dhabi. This is far off from what I initially booked. The woman on the phone assured me that this is my best option. So I sayed ok to the changed booking. After that I checked on the Internet and found a direct flight from Air Madagaskar to the Seychelles with which I could have kept my initial schedule. Air Madagaskar is in the Vanilla Alliance with Air Seychelles. So a booking would have been possible. I called the hotline again and asked for the flight with Air Madagaskar to the Seychelles. I was told that I already changed my flight once and that another change would cost several hundred dollars. So I ended up with a flight that takes double the time of my initial flight with a stop at Mauritius at 2 a.m. in the night and a one day later arrival at my destination.

While calling the hotline I got disconnected several times when I asked uncomfortable questions.

This is my last flight with Air Seychelles.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buchpetzer,buchpetzer wrote a review Oct 2017,buchpetzer,"Frankfurt, Germany",1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Antananarivo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r537534145-Air_Seychelles-World.html,2x flight canceled,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Outward flight from Manchester operated on behalf of Air Seychelles by Etihad went without incident. The return flight from mauritius by Air Seychelles, different story and turned out to be a nightmare!!!!!!
After boarding we found out the plane was being diverted to Madagascar to deliver a spare tyre of all things (surely they could have thought of a better excuse!). As a result the flight arrived late in Seychelles and we missed our connecting flight to Manchester.
They arranged for us to fly to Paris instead with the promise that all appropriate arrangements would be made for us to fly from Paris to Manchester.
However when we arrive in Paris we were sent from counter to counter, finally we were told by Air France (who Air Seychelles had said they were booking our flight with) that no connecting flight had been arranged, leaving us stranded in Paris.
We were told to liase with Air Seychelles counter outside the transit area, after leaving transit and reaching the Terminal 2C we were told by the information desk the Air Seychelles counter had closed months ago, leaving us worried and anxious we were now outside the transit area without our baggage. We were given a contact number for Air Seychelles office in Paris, to further add to the nightmare the office was shut as it was a Saturday! Leaving us with no choice but to ring Air Seychelles office in Seychelles at an enormous cost to us, at least 3 times to arrange a connection between Paris and Manchester.
We then had to plead with Security to collect our luggage from within the transit area and make a dash across the airport to another terminal to check in for our onward journey, making it exhausted but just in the nick of time.
To make matters worse, after contacting Air Seychelles when we got home to complain about our experience we are still waiting for a response a week later!
After this experience I would not recommend Air Seychelles to anyone!

A short flight with Air Seychelles on their A330 was fairly pleasant. We also flew with the A320 on Air Seychelles. And would recommend trying to book with the A330. Better seats and more selection for the IFE as well as a better selection of drinks. The airline is not in the same class of the middle eastern carriers.

"One leg of a four leg round trip between Manchester and the Seychelles, this leg was from Mahe back to Abu Dhabi.

Check-in was fine, staff friendly enough. The airport in Mahe is very basic, little to do other than wait around. The flight was slightly delayed on take-off but managed to get ahead of schedule when in the air.

The seats were cramped and very uncomfortable, the food pretty dire and the entertainment system not worth the name. Not much variety and any decent film had the mandatory sub-tiles taking up a large part of the screen, Too distracting for me. I wish they would let you turn them off.

"Short 20 minute flight between Islands a great experience! Very small, reduced luggage allowance of 20 kgs each only small bags allowed in the cabin. Any cabin sized bags had to go in the hold. We are tall so had to duck when getting to our seats & had to sit with legs into the isle as not enough room for our knees between the seats, but the flight is amazing, noisy but great views into the open cockpit & of the Islands as you fly over. Would not have missed it.
The young Lady in the domestic departure lounge was not very friendly or helpful & simply waved people away without further information when they asked if it was their flight boarding. This is a very small lounge with no information boards & small planes leaving every few minutes to different Islands, tourists are obviously confused. A simple announcement regarding which plane is boarding would have alleviated this.

"This was just a short hop return flight between the islands of Mahe and Praslin.
The DHC-6Twin Otter aircraft used for this flight are fairly small (around 20 seats) but never the less are operated just as professionaly as larger airlines and the staff are friendly and helpful. Admittedly, the seating layout is tight and the turbo prop engines are pretty noisy but this is only to be expected in this type of aircraft. Nervous flyers could possibly find the flight quite challenging due to the fact that it flies fairly low over the sea because of the short journey time. Reassuringly, this is a very reliable aircraft despite its size and the aircrew were very professional in their approach to the flight.
This 15 minute flight is an alternative to a 1 hour ferry journey and would be my personal choice, though the ferry fare may be cheaper. I really enjoyed these flights, which gave a great view of the island coastlines and surrounding reefs and I would recommend the flights to anyone wanting to visit Praslin Island whilst in the Seychelles.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradlian,bradlian wrote a review Sep 2017,bradlian,South Yorkshire,27 contributions,14 helpful votes,Victoria - Praslin Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r523235631-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Inter-Island,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My review is based on experiences regarding intercontinental (Düsseldorf - Mahe and back), African (Mahe to Antananarivo and back) and domestic flights (Mahe - Praslin - Mahe). It was a very mixed experience, with more negative elements than positive altogether.
We have booked our flights to Madagascar 6 months earlier, exactly because of the short connection time in Mahe. 3 weeks before the flight I got an email saying that our connection to Antananarivo was cancelled for that day, we have to spend a night in the Seychelles and take next day's flight. After complaining, they promised to book us a night in the Savoy hotel at Beau Vallon beach. Instead, we were brought to Eden Bleu hotel upon arrival, which is close to the airport, but far away from the beach. We didn't have any idea where we were until it was too late, so they didn't keep their promise.
The flight from Düsseldorf was very pleasant, by the way. About 2/3 of the seats were empty, so there was plenty of space for everyone and we got good service. On the way back, the situation was completely different. The flight was much more full, it took forever until they finally served food, they kept the light on for too long, so it was impossible to sleep, also breakfast was way too early. In the evening it was too hot in the airplane, they didn't reduce temperature until a passenger got sick and they started asking for a doctor. Service was terrible, you had to fight for drinks. In the morning I asked for tea and got coffee. After I realized the mistake, I asked for tea again, the stewardess refused. The staff was generally not polite at all. Food and in-flight entertainment were, however, surprisingly good. I enjoyed the fish curry. There was a wide range of movies and music to choose from. Seat comfort and legroom were average in economy.
Also on the flights to and from Madagascar, service was bad. They had tea, coffee, water etc. when collecting the dishes / garbage after lunch, but they never offered it. This resulted many passengers having to walk to the kitchen to ask for drinks. The in-flight entertainment didn't work on the flight to Antananarivo at all, but it did on the way back.
The best were the short domestic flights to and from Praslin - not much space, but safe flights, not much to go wrong during such a short time. We were even allowed to take all our luggage for free (3 pieces, even though originally the booking stated only 2 of 20 kg - our luggage was around 60 kg altogether). However, also here they cancelled our original flight and put us on a later one, which was late - it seems to be a very common practice with Air Seychelles. So think about this when planning your flight home, it can be a problem if you don't have enough time (4 hours between domestic and international flight were safe in our case).
Altogether, it wasn't a pleasant experience using this airline, it caused lots of unnecessary stress and I'll definitely try to fly with another company should I travel to this part of the world again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unelma333,Unelma333 wrote a review Jul 2017,Unelma333,"Karlsruhe, Germany",1217 contributions,331 helpful votes,Düsseldorf - Antananarivo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r505078271-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Not too pleasant,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Air Seychelles was on the path to being one of the best airlines in Africa or perhaps the best... with the support and management of Etihad. But since Etihad handed it back to local management, Air Seychelles has dropped its standards and would be a typical 'african' airline. The flights are almost always delayed, especially the flight leaving the Seychelles in the mornings.
It is hard to imagine what the reasons are but often we would notice that the plane is still being loaded with cargo and the attitude and mannerism shown by ground staff would indicate a very relaxed, no hurry style.
I would suggest that people consider flying Emirates... cleaner plane, better food and on time with 3 flights into the Seychelles daily.
I'm an Etihad frequent flyer but have lost respect for the airline that they 'in essence' have taken over....",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/fb/a4/f6/jazz21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476jasminev,Jasmine V wrote a review Jul 2017,Jasmine V,"Eden Island, Seychelles",17 contributions,25 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Victoria,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r503425754-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Constant delays from Seychelles,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Of the eight times we have flown to Seychelles and back, this was definitely the worst. The basic necessities were hard to come by. We have never had to deal with the amount of body odour and the filthy toilets were completely unacceptable. Many seats were broken as well as seat pockets, TV set adjustments etc. The cabin crew ( with the exception of one or two) were surly and unhelpful. The air conditioning was set on freezing and asking for a blanket was like asking for a pint of blood. We received one two hours after first asking. Pressing the bell was like shouting into the wind. We were completely ignored. Many passengers needed special diets which took up a lot of time, but then, while the rest of us were served, they still demanded attention. We had to wait for the main dishes and the kids were crumpled and open. The overall experience was awful. It was by far the worst flight we've had in many years.

"We flew Air Seychelles to Cape Town via JNB. First thing. If a flight is late into Seychelles ALL flights are delayed so the people can connect so I expect flights a late a lot.
Second, don't expect much food on flights. Our flight to JNB left at 11am and all we got was a light breakfast. It's a 5 hour flight and we were hungry.
Third and most of all, we missed our connecting Cape Town flight (booked with air seychelles flight number) because of leaving Seychelles late. We were met at the gate on arrival and I thought this would be fixed up with minimum hassle. It was not. Long story short, we went back and forth between the Air Seychelles ticket office and check in for domestic flights 4 times (and they are opposite ends of airport) trying to get on aflight to Cape Town.
The Air Seychelles staff would tell us we were booked on next flight, we would get to the check in and we wouldn't be booked in properly and then we would have to repeat. By the fourth time, the last flight to cape town was about to leave and we had to pay 7000 rand to get tickets on it.
The staff at Air Seychelles were terrible to us. They would not answer questions and would ignore any. They would swear we were booked but then not be surprised when we got back to them saying they weren't but still wouldn't help in a timely manner.
All this was made worse by the fact we have three kids including an infant. We were literally all crying as we were unable to eat other than the light breakfast on the first flight because we had to keep running back and forth to try to get the flights. They did not care at all.
we were not the only ones effected. They even gave boarding passes for connecting flights to people hopping of the first flight that did not work and the people owuld find out they needed to pay when they tried to board!!
It was an absolute joke. I have complained but can't get any response.

"We had booked ourselves on this domestic Air Seychelles flight just because of luggage. We were not sure if we would be allowed on the ferry with our luggage, most specifically, a stroller for our daughter.
I'm still not sure about the stroller but the luggage would have been allowed on the boat and though it would take thrice as much time taken to fly, I would have preferred the 1 hour boat ride any day.
The aircraft is a small one and I didn't expect seat comfort, legroom or food & beverages. Still I could not like the journey because of the humid, suffocating environment inside. It was too hot even for me who is used to hot & humid weather in India.
The only advantage is the journey time is less but again it's just 1 hour by boat, not high!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/d6/6e/82/ananyabinayak.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ananyabinayak,ananyabinayak wrote a review Jun 2017,ananyabinayak,"Pune, India",115 contributions,87 helpful votes,Praslin Island - Victoria,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r493463311-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Avoid for Mahe <-> Praslin if possible,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had booked ourselvs on Mumbai - Mahe - Praslin flight. We checked in almost an hour before the scheduled flight time and they asked if we are ready to avail a flight 30 minutes before our scheduled one, We happily agreed.
The flight is really a small islander plane, comfort is something you can forget about. Leg space is too small, they allow passengers with hand baggage but almost no space for those, you have to sit with it on your lap. Well, this was acceptable being a small plane, which I could not accept is almost absence of any air conditioning. Air conditioning is off during take off, landing and being of 20 minutes duration, it does not cool in between. Everyone one sweating and we were almost suffocated, got down with a headache. Same was the case on return flight as well.
I would suggest you to avail the ferry service instead of the flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/d6/6e/82/ananyabinayak.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ananyabinayak,ananyabinayak wrote a review Jun 2017,ananyabinayak,"Pune, India",115 contributions,87 helpful votes,Victoria - Praslin Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r491634769-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Mahe to Praslin flight was pathetic,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had our return journey from Seychelles to Mumbai also on this airline. With an infant, we had to ask for priority check in and the ground staff accepted it but rather reluctantly. There was one single counter for Business class and priority check in with infants or for senior citizens.
When we reached, one lady was checking in the priority counter and there was a long queue on economy counter and check in was taking long time for a family whom we saw leaving the hotel more than half an hour before us. We asked for priority check in and the ground staff asked to wait in the economy queue and see if that's faster than the other counter. My husband was waiting on the queue for general counter and I was standing on the priority counter and the lady actually quipped that I can wait on the other queue and still check in.
Of course, the priority counter was free first and we checked in there and they just gave us boarding pass for middle row which was not having the extra leg room for infant. Again, we asked for it and then the lady in counter ran to stop the baggage, change the baggage tag, boarding pass and we were set.
This flight was also delayed by few minutes and the boarding started just 5 minutes before the scheduled departure. On boarding gate they asked me to fold the stroller and hand over to them, I didn't get the reason as generally I take the stroller till the flight. As it was a small walk, I followed and handed over the stroller. Faced the problem in Mumbai, the stroller was not handed over to us after de-boarding from the flight and we had to carry the baby along with the hand luggage for quite a distanace. The stroller was also delayed in baggage belt, we got it very late. Even in domestic flights, I hand over the stroller just before stepping into the flight and get it after stepping out from the flight. This was not expected from an international carrier.
This time also they served one meal, dinner, the food was neither tasty nor sufficient for dinner.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/d6/6e/82/ananyabinayak.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ananyabinayak,ananyabinayak wrote a review Jun 2017,ananyabinayak,"Pune, India",115 contributions,87 helpful votes,Victoria - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r491502100-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Best for Seychelles - Mumbai Travel,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I selected Air Seychelles as they offered direct flight for Seychelles from Mumbai. We were travelling with an infant but were still not provided priority check in. We were not in a hurry and hence didn't ask for it but generally with other airlines, we didn't have to ask for it. Here, actually they asked if we were travelling Business Class and then guided us to the normal economy class queue instead of priority queue.
Flight was a bit delayed, for boarding we asked for priority boarding and got it. It was of 4.5 hours duration, we got the front row seats having extra leg space as we were travelling with infant. Seats were comfortable. They serve only one meal during the 4.5 hrs flight, it was a breakfast, just ok kind. In all airlines, I had traveled before, Juice/soft drink/hard drink was provided as a pre/with meal option and tea/coffee as post meal option. Here it was not, all options were provided together, with meal. I still thought that they would come back with tea/coffee later but they didn't.
My daughter was sleeping most of the time and woke up crying but didn't accept any food that we offered. They provided a tray with some dessert, fruit plate and bread-butter-jam which she had.

The entertainment system did not work - they kept telling us they were trying to reset it. Then at then end of the flight as we descended, we were told it was being switched off - it had not even been on...epic fail using a prerecorded or scripted message.

We were served breakfast, then immediately a round of water or coffee.

My entertainment system did not work. This was minor in comparison to the attitude from the cabin attendants and controller. I buzzed for attention - 15 minutes later, no-one had come. I then flagged down the passing cabin attendant who brought the cabin controller. I was told they had reset it twice and there was nothing more they could do (in a very passive-aggressive way) - when I asked for a complaint form I was asked if I was sure I wanted to complete it as it was a full A4 page that needed to be completed. I assured them I would complete it, but it was not forthcoming.

"We flew the second time with Air Seychelles, From Abu Dhabi to Mahe and then on to Johannesburg. The flights were fine, they informed us before of potential turbulence ahead and that the seat belt lights might be switched on during the flight. The food was fine (for ailine standards). Leg space in economy is about 5 cm more than on most other airlines. The stewards/esses are friendly and provided a good service. The only negative excperinece was the booking preces as we booked via Ehiad. We were not able to reserve the seats from the Seychelles to Johannesburg online. Ended up phoning Air Seychelles who could not reserve the seats either but promised us to look into it and phone us back. They did not phone back and after we arrived in the Seychelles we phoned again to hear that it was arranged, which was nice. Another problem with booking was that we would have prefered to fly from the Seychelles tu Durban instead of Johannesburg but that was impossible to arrange as we flew under a Ehiad code and booking the flights loose would have cost us quite a bit more.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josefine2017,josefine2017 wrote a review May 2017,josefine2017,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",61 contributions,36 helpful votes,Abu Dhabi - Victoria,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r482283216-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Overal  positive experinence.,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

But then nobody is available to help you! The representative is apparently not available...the people from the service at the airport are super rude, telling you they would call some representative but in fact they are calling some colleagues gossiping about you in French and making fun of your situation assuming you can't speak French...well sorry I speak French perfectly fine and I understand them! The airline offers you $ 40 to buy the most ""necessary"" things on a Sunday where everything is closed and a sunscreen in the hotel costs $37...it's simply a joke if it wasn't  that serious... 2) no information from the airport even after days! They promise you they'll call you but nobody ever calls or gives you any information! I'm left in Mauritius without any contact lenses and i can basically see nothing so thank you very much air Seychelles (very ironic) for ruining my 2,5k holiday where I wanted to see a beautiful island but I can't see anything without the things in my luggage! 3) even without all the hassle already the flight was really bad! The stewards and stewardess are super rude (I fly twice a week due to my job and I have never experienced anything like this)!

"I take carrier with which I choose to get to my destination very serious and having flown with some of the leading airlines in the world, I decided to travel with Air Seychelles, since it has a direct flight from Johannesburg. The flight to Seychelles was okay-ish, but the return flight was a total nightmare. The return flight (HM 61 on Sunday 02 April 2017) saw the Cabin Crew showing a total disregard for passengers by blatantly ignoring them. In short they spoiled what otherwise would have been an amazing trip to their beautiful country. They were abrupt, unfriendly, lacked service ethic and most of all, ignored passengers. Mid-way through the flight, I activated the service light and for more than five minutes, I sat waiting, with not a single Cabin Crew in sight. I got up from my seat and saw various other passengers with service lights activated. I finally got up and decided to use the lavatory upon which I proceeded to the back of the plane, where to my amazement I found the crew gathered in the back chatting. What I assumed was a bathroom in the back of the plane turned out to be the crew galley or pantry and when I enquired about the whereabouts of the lavatory, I was pointed by finger to find my way to the centre of the plane. Upon my return to my seat I found them still seated in the back and my service light de-activated. I activated it again. After what seemed like hours, someone finally came and it felt like an inconvenience for them.

I will definitely not recommend Air Seychelles to anyone in the Travel and Tourism sector and personally I would rather fly half way around the world to connect with a different carrier to get me to Seychelles. Instead of flying the Seychellois flag for they beautiful country, the impertinence and disrespect does much damage to the gem in the Indian Ocean and leave their brand image scarred. Perhaps they should do what Qatar and Emirates does and recruit international crew from around the globe, since their own could not be bothered to align themselves to the brand they´re representing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/e2/a3/74/johann-o.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johanno978,Johann O wrote a review Apr 2017,Johann O,"Maputo, Mozambique",133 contributions,40 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Praslin Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r473058530-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Need to up their game!!!,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Now I am not one to complaint but me and my partner have had the worst experience with Air Seychelles please never use them for your own benefit.

We are getting married in Mauritius August 2017 which we are super excited and have around 60+ family and friends flying with us all using Air Seychelles as we were recommended (worst mistake). With all the stresses that we have organising the wedding Air Seychelles decide to cancel one of there flights.

1, they did not even tell us they cancelled the flights ( no email, no call, no letter). I would of turned up to the airport and told I couldn't even make my own wedding which they explained this is a system error that they have? I'm sorry but that's not good enough, especially when we have 60+ people flying to our wedding.

2, when I contacted them all they could do is offer a refund? I don't want a refund, i want to get to Mauritius as i booked.

3, Now half of us have managed to get an alternative but have to wait in Abu Dhabi for 7 hours but the other half haven’t because they are flying on different dates there are no alternatives but a refund?

4, It sometimes feels like they don't even want your custom, don't reply to emails, no call backs when they say they will, they just don't seem bothered by the distress they have caused us.

This is the most important day of mine and my partners lives. We want all our friends and family there, but the service Air Seychelles have provided means that some of our friends who have booked now can not afford flights as they booked way in advance and now prices are a lot more expensive.

We have told the 60+ family and friends to also comment on forums to make sure that this does not happen to anyone else.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avirampeearee,avirampeearee wrote a review Mar 2017,avirampeearee,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",1 contribution,4 helpful votes,Manchester - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r465654385-Air_Seychelles-World.html,DO NOT USE AIR SEYCHELLES,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I don't know where to begin with this airline. From the very beginning when we were waiting for our check-in at the terminal in Mumbai, we got a feel of the inefficiency of the staff. Air Seychelles is a partner airline with Etihad and I'm shocked at the level of service offered. At check-in, there were no separate counters classified for passengers travelling to Abu Dhabi and the Seychelles. Instead, passengers were mixed up and we wanted more leg room and asked if we could get an aisle seat. We were offered the seats at the emergency exits and had to pay extra by the Etihad staff. We thought it was fair since the leg room would be better. Little did we know what we had in store for us once we got into the aircraft.

Instead of boarding passengers in batches - senior citizens, guests with children, Business Class and seat numbers in that order, we were called in random numbers when nothing was smooth and it took us 45 minutes of solid waiting in queue to get inside the damn aircraft. We were tired, sleep-deprived and needless to say, running awfully short of patience.

Once inside the aircraft we discovered there was no leg room as we dreamt of. The luggage was not handled properly, the overhead cabins were teeming with cabin bags of all shapes and sizes. Even our slot was taken up by someone else. The food was nothing to write home about and neither was the service.

Our nightmare didnt end there. When we reached Mahe, after we were kept waiting for over 25 mins at the luggage belt, we were told by the staff that our luggage is still in Mumbai and the airline couldn't bring it over because they exceeded the weight limitations. We were told that they would be delivered to us hopefully within the next 24 hours. That meant spending another hour filling out our addresses and details on plain A4 sized papers. As tourists and guests, we were NEVER told what the airline would do to compensate for the money we spent on a change of clothes, a toothbrush and other essentials. What was worst was one of the Business Class passengers promptly received his luggage and happily trotted out of the airport. The rest of us were kept waiting like refugees. The staff were taking their own sweet time to answer questions and chatting and joking among themselves when irate and anxious passengers were left struggling, trying to call their travel agents not knowing what to do without their luggage. Grossly indifferent and negligent ground staff at Mahe airport. The next day, thankfully, we received our luggage (during which time we spent our own money and brought clothes from a store at the hotel that would get us through the day) - this is not compensated for by the airline TILL NOW. Upon looking at the baggage tag, we realized that our bags made a sojourn all the way from India to Abu Dhabi and then made its way to the Seychelles. I was told some guests don't receive their luggage until 2-3 days and some don't receive it at all! Thinking of them, I felt we were in a better situation.

Our return flight from Mahe airport in the Seychelles to Mumbai was no different. The check-in counters are manned by staff who think they are doing us a favour by talking to us.Arrogant, indifferent and impolite. Why can't Air Seychelles employ someone who speaks and knows Hindi as a language considering most passengers are labourers who cannot speak English or French? And also since most passengers are Indians?!

Coming to the most shocking part - my husband and I were sitting at the emergency exit row. We were given the aisle and middle seats. Picture this - there was no safety briefing on how the lady sitting at the window would handle the situation, had there been an emergency landing!!!! Atrocious! No willingness asked for, no permissions taken. Somewhere during the journey, i realized my leg hit something metallic. Upon inspection, i found it was a loose electrical circuit plug lingering around freely along with the several plastic containers that people had dropped on the ground. Thankfully I didnt get an electric shock. Just one word - GROSS NEGLIGENCE. I should have taken a picture but I was too tired to even move.

Lastly, the crew were very very slow and indifferent to passengers' plea for a drink of water. Am not sure what went on in the pantry but this was shocking. We don't pay this kind of money even if we're Economy passengers to be given this kind of shoddy treatment. An airline of supposed repute like Etihad should take note.

There was no information regarding which belt in Mumbai airport would carry our luggage. We had to fend for ourselves. I was just thankful that we made it to Mumbai safely and was praying desperately for the luggage to arrive. Well that took another 20 minutes of waiting, but we did get our luggage.

"Positive:
They use the Airbus A330 between Mahe and Johannesburg (at least for the flight I took).The Business class has large seats with lots of legroom, they can be turned into full flat beds which are comfortable for this 5 hours flight.

Negative:
Booking, flight reconfirmation and any service via phone is difficult, many staff are not fully informed and you do not get help which makes the process a bit tiring and difficult.
The Service and Food on this flight were at Maximum mediocre, the Crew wanted to serve Food and Drinks as fast as possible and then have their rest, for more than 3 hours they did not Show up and did not really take care of the customers, e.g. toilets were not cleaned and no paper tissues refilled during the flight. They lacked friendliness (surprising to me as most Seychellois are very friendly...).

"We had the worst air travel experience with Air Seychelles, flying from Tana, Madagascar to Kathmandu, Nepal on 11/4/2016. We had two transfers - Mahe and Mumbai. We were treated like illegal immigrants (or worst) and forced to stay at the airport overnight because the ignorant supervisor on ground in Mahe, Seychelles.

We flew from Tana to Mahe. When we arrived Mahe, they refused to issue us boarding passes for our next two connections (Mahe-Mumbai-KTM) because we did not have onward tickets after Nepal. We explained to them that we are backpackers. We travel by land mostly and plan to cross the boarder by car from Nepal to India. The supervisor told us she will check and disappeared. When we asked about our flight, she said we still have time and she will not leave us behind.

We waited in the airport until 9:10pm when our connection flight to Mumbai was boarding. By that time, we've purchased our onward ticket from KTM to Delhi as we cannot afford to miss the flight. We showed our ticket to one of the staffs. The first thing she told us is we cannot boarding our flight because the gate is closed!! Then when she phoned the supervisor, the supervisor demanded to see our INDIA VISA, which was completely irrelevant. We waited there thinking the supervisor will come back to us, but they just let us missed the flight like that! Even after we had all the documents they asked for!

In the end, the supervisor never showed up and they did not let us board our flight even though we had the onward tickets. We were dumped in the airport without any explanation. We did not know why we need to show the airline our India visa while we are just flying to Nepal and what should we do for the flights that we've missed.

When the supervisor showed up around midnight, she said we will have to wait for the next day to rearrange the tickets and just disappeared again. They tried to send us to a hotel but it was too late, the immigration officer didn't let us pass. Therefore, we were forced to sleep in the airpot. None of Air Seychelles' staffs asked if we have food, water or blanket. They just all left and dumped us there like we were some kind of illegal immigrations or refuges!!

After a night in the airport. On 11/5, we spoke with numerous of their staffs about our issue, including the supervisors and duty managers. None of them helped. They either pushed us around or said they will check and disappeared. I told them I need to take medicines, which is in my big bag that they'd kept my bag in their office. The lady I spoke said she will take it for me and never showed up. What if I have a serious condition and I would just die without my medicines?? None of Air Seychelles' staffs cared about their customers.

In the end, we were able to board the flight on 11/5 with EXACTLY THE SAME DOCUMENTS we had a night before, which means we could've boarded our original flight!!! We did not need to sleep at the airport and we did not need to go through this mental and physical torture!!!

Two things that i learned about this airline 1) they have unprofessional and unqualified supervisor that does not have the knowledge of basic airline policy, or rather, common senses of air travel ; 2) their staffs cannot care less about their customers.

The seats were incredibly comfortable and the most spacious I've seen (I had to get up to reach the seat-back pocket).  Service was excellent overall (though on the return flight I had to ask for a headset - then when I hadn't gotten it 10 minutes later, had to go to the galley to get).  The flight was about 5 hours, and went by quickly.  A note about the airport in Mahe - the ground crew doesn't pay attention to the priority labels on the bags.  We and other business class passengers didn't get our bags until most were off the conveyor.  Business class lounge in Mahe was generally nice the morning of our return flight. There were children running around and being loud for a prolonged time before someone (not sure if a member of staff or another passenger) got them to quiet down.

"Had booked a business class seat via South African Airways two months prior and when I got to the Air Seychelles check-in counter I was told my name didn't appear in the system. Despite that, the ground staff still made an effort to counter check everything and I did get a boarding pass for business class.

After boarding, we remained grounded for 2 hours due to some technical issues. The cabin crew was very professional and helpful to the passengers throughout the whole process. Being with us from boarding, during the long and uncertain wait, and the eventual disembarkation. All throughout keeping the passengers calm, respectfully answering queries and allaying fears and being attentive to everyone’s basic needs.

After we disembarked we waited again another hour for final confirmation whether the flight will be canceled. Then came the long tedious process of going back through immigration, reclaim our luggage and be transported to our hotel. During this grueling process of getting us organized, the ground crew was there for us, making sure we got settled comfortably in our hotel with our luggage.

The technical team eventually resolved the problem and the flight crew safely and uneventfully brought us to Mahe the next day. The flight itself was very comfortable and the crew up at business class was very attentive and accommodating.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luc_victor_jr,Luc Victor wrote a review Oct 2016,Luc Victor,.,761 contributions,133 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r425784030-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Amazing Crew,Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were scheduled  to fly by this airline on 21st September, 2016 from Johannesburg to Mumbai. When we reached the airport , we were informed that the flight was delayed by one hour. Instead of 13.45 it will depart at 14.45. On the gate there was no announcement, and the boarding did not commence till 15.15. The process commenced but we were not allowed to board the flight. Then we were once again asked to sit near the gate. The boarding commenced at 15.55. We were seated in the heated plane as the A.C. was not working. We were informed that we will be on the way in next 15 minutes. Nothing happened. At 16.45 they informed us that due to some technical snag, it may take another 30 minutes. We disembarked from the plane at 17.00 hrs. We waited for another hour. No refreshments were served. Not even water. No one offered any explanation. At 18.00 hrs. on hue and cry someone said that we will be told the fate of our flight in 20 mins. Nothing till 18.45. Suddenly at 19.15 they informed that flight was cancelled. What was to be done was never said. Some passengers started towards immigration and others followed. Our baggage was supposed to come and we waited till 20.3 for it to come. Once again , we learnt from other passengers that we were to be taken to a Hotel and the baggage would come there. From where , which hotel , next day's plans : nothing was announced. We ultimately checked into a nearby hotel by 21.15 , totally exhausted. After the dinner, at around 22.30 we were informed that we should assemble at 7.00 a.m to be transferred to Airport. Once again no flight details. In the morning we grouped to gather and ultimately boarded an Etihaad flight to Abu Dhabi at 10.15. Ultimately we heaved a sigh a relief but , the airline was not informed about the food preference of the passengers and we being vegetarians, did not get vegetarian meals. Anyway poor management, poor communication left a bad taste in the mouth. Though they arranged for the hotel stay and dinner but it was without their commitment, only by compulsion and no one from the airline was there to redress our grievance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/ba/bc/2b/hapee47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hapee47,hapee47 wrote a review Sep 2016,hapee47,"Ahmedabad, India",29 contributions,10 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r422683311-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Lack of communication and concern,Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

• Clean, not much spacious but was okay to fit in
• Good food, we had Asian vegetarian meal
• Good in flight entertainment
• On time arrival and departure from Mumbai and Mauritius except at the Seychelles airport

Cons:
• Delay at Seychelles airport during both times, the airport is so small with less staff that passengers from 2 consecutive flights can make it crowded.
• It was mentioned on the boarding pass that boarding will commence from gate 1, on the screen it showed gate 3 and it actually happened from gate 2. So, we advice travelers to keep their eyes and ear open while on transit at Seychelles airport

"I had a wonderful time the first time despite my flight was delay. Without hesitation, I choose Air Seychelles for the second time. But it was a bad experience! At boarding in Mauritius, my hand luggage was taken against my will. On arrival at Paris, it was missing. I find it completely unprofessional how in our world today with the security and technology available to airlines, no one was able to locate my bag. My well deserves vacation turns into a stressful holiday as most of my clothes were in my hand luggage! Finally, I received my bag after 04 days! Sincerely, I do believe I deserve some kind of compensation for being without my personal belongings! After inquiry with the airline, they informed that according to their policy they refund only checked luggage. But they should also review their policy by informing guest on check in that they need to check their hand luggage! If I was aware, I would have done it. They make me feel responsible for their error!

Planes are very clean and toilets are cleaned regularly during flight. Food is surprisingly appetizing. Servings are big enough. Staff are very friendly and extremely helpful.

I wanted to bring to your attention the pathetic experience I have recently had flying Air Seychelles and its partner Etihad on the Mumbai-Dar Es Salaam-Mumbai route. I had booked an confirmed Air Seychelles flight Mumbai-Male-Dar-Mumbai (PNR:JY4MS) on January 2016 for flying in July 2016. A month later we were informed that Air Seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi (PNR:NXCBKX). I had confirmed with the Mumbai office of Air Seychelles and the flight was confirmed. A week before flying I checked with Etihad online and they informed me that my Abu Dhabi-Dar es Salaam sector was not confirmed. Neither Air Seychelles nor Etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation inspite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in January! If I had not followed up I would have been stranded in Abu Dhabi. The Air Seychelles ground office in Mumbai was equally clueless. Repeated emails from them to Air Seychelles and Etihad (on highest priority I was told) went unanswered. Only after I threatened to take Air Seychelles and Etihad to consumer court did they swing into action and book us on Kenyan Airways. As a gesture we were informed that a special request for upgradation to Business class has been put but ofcourse as expected there was no record on the system during check in. Also the complimentary chauffer service from Etihad was not available as the PNR was 'not registered' in the system. The only explanation that I was offered was 'a system glitch'. This is highly irresponsible of both Air Seychelles and Etihad. I will definitely not be flying either airlines and will actively inform as many as I can to be wary of both these third-class operators. I would rather pay more and go by a more reliable airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. Both Etihad and Air Seychelles promise a lot but once the money is exchanged forget your responsibility.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnirbanG6,Anirban G wrote a review Aug 2016,Anirban G,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Mumbai - Dar es Salaam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r400513213-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Pathetic ticketing glitch and no information from Air Seychelles,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled with my wife to Paris on 17th June & back on 7th July'16. We had taken business class seats on both trips. The aircraft was quite modern and seats very spacious which was a step up compared to the small versions of the planes. Service wise the cabin crew were very warm and I would say average service level compared to other airlines I've travelled world wide. My wife and I had only one reservation and important comment for the Air Seychelles Executives to take note. The moment the cabin attendants new that we were Seychellois, the level of service and attention compared to other business class pax, dropped and we felt inferior. At first we were addressed either in English or French but then most of them switched communication to us in creole.  I had the similar experience when I travelled to South Africa 2 weeks earlier in Business Class, when a crew member asked me if I was travelling on rebate. Come on guys, 2 business class tickets to Paris cost me Scr. 64,000/-. It is not because I am Seychellois that the service level should drop.

"We choose Air Seychelles for our trip to India between March and April this yea. Being competitive in price and with hop over in Seychelles the trip was all set for great experience.The trip to..from Mauritius to Mumbai was fine.
However return was not the same. We arrive to check-in at Mumbai and there was no representative for airlines and they have only three counters checking in for flight.
Finally our turn to check in came. I had 75 kilo luggage for three check in passenger and one hand bag per person as per limit however I was travelling back with clay Tabla (musical instrument). I kept it back with me as hand luggage knowing its fragile and could be broken in checked in. We did the same in all internal flight in India.
The staff at counter and supervisor and shift both refused saying that its not possible we argued over 30 minutes and at last have to accept to put it in luggage. Sarcastically enough they said they cary glass,tv and all in checkin so its just a tabla.
We arrived at Mauritius and opened the bag at airport..as expected the set was broken...we were sad and shocked..we looked around for Air seychelles staff at airport again there was no one from airline and was asked to speak to airmauritius luggage services we spoke to lady on counter reported a broken delsey suitcass and tabla..she took the request and said team will get in touch..for two weeks there was no follow up we called the same reply wait some one will get in touch.
After a month we lost all patience and took both and went to there office in portlouise. They were surprised that we reported it after a month..but still logged in the complaint and said will take care..we waited for three long weeks to be told a fraction of ticketing policy stating "" airlines is not responsible for breakage of item inside luggage""
They denied to repay for exchange of the peice broken by mishandling of their ground handleling agent and there rudeness.
Asking to get contact for higher management was never reverted either and office in mauritius is on for show as they can't decide a simple case of luggage mishandling .

Since its small aircraft, please do not expect on time. 10 to 15 minutes delays happen.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/8a/73/aa/gopinath747.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gopinath747,Gopi nath wrote a review Apr 2016,Gopi nath,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",255 contributions,71 helpful votes,Victoria - Praslin Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r368933915-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Amazing experience on the domestic flight,Date of travel: April 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A serene experience just like the natures beauty in Seychelles. Comfortable and spacious inside the plane. Humble and cheerful staff. Good quality food served. On time flights.

"Air Seychelles flight from Praslin airport (with the bizarre and obscene fountain), to SEZ airport on Mahe HM3121, 10 Feb 2016
The aircraft is a Canadian-built DHC-6 Twin Otter, which are very safe and rugged planes.
The original aircraft are a bit older, but everything in the cockpit has been totally modernized and is all digital. Do not let the look fool you.
Everything was on time and a great flight experience.
The views outside are spectacular. And as most flights are only 15 minutes duration just watching the islands and ocean is great entertainment.
I felt really safe and enjoyed the flight more than any in recent years.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/57/c7/0f/john-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189JohnC,John C wrote a review Mar 2016,John C,"Ottawa, Canada",365 contributions,131 helpful votes,Praslin Island - Victoria,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r354551760-Air_Seychelles-World.html,On Time and Safe - just what we wanted!,Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was an (almost) daily flight by Air Seychelles to Bird Island (BDI), a grass strip 100 km north of the capital.
The aircraft is a Canadian-built Twin Otter, which are very safe and rugged planes.
The original aircraft are a bit older, but everything in the cockpit has been totally modernized and is all digital. Do not let the look fool you.
Everything was on time and a great flight experience.
The in-flight entertainment is looking out the windows at Seychelles.
Th boarding lounge on Bird Island is a grassy area with wooden stumps under coconut trees. BEST BOARDING LOUNGE EVER!
Tripadvisor does not know what BDI is, so I had to change to an airport they understood. This flight is actually from SEZ-BDI-SEZ",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/57/c7/0f/john-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189JohnC,John C wrote a review Mar 2016,John C,"Ottawa, Canada",365 contributions,131 helpful votes,Victoria - Praslin Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r354509595-Air_Seychelles-World.html,Short Hops to Adventure on Bird Island,Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We Travelled from Mumbai to Seychelles and Seychelles to Mauritius. we had 3 hrs transit time to take second flight in seychelles. the seychelles airport is very small transit airport and there was no we check in facility.

"The flight was scheduled to leave at 2:30pm, and we left on time. I would say that the aircraft is somewhat tired and needs some uplifting (in terms of in-flight entertainment and seating). As far as I remember it was an Airbus A330-200 (i stand to correction). Personally, I never eat airline food so I'm not sure about the food. Staff were friendly and we landed on both occasions, half an hour prior to the scheduled time.

"We were booked on this flight by our Agent -Thomas Cook India, as part of a package deal to Mauritius. But the ordeal began as soon as we checked in at 2.05 am for a flight at 5.00 am to Mahe and then to Mauritius. There was no web check in facility and its Mumbai office told that the airport counter will open 3 hours before, while it actually opened 4 hours before. So, by the time we were there, all seats were full and counter person was not giving us two seats side by side. With great difficulty, we could get two aisle seats in same row up to Mahe. From Mahe, he again allotted us seats 8 rows apart and asked us to try for change of seats at Mahe, as they had different softwares. But on reaching Mahe, the officials flatly refused and we had to travel 8 rows apart. In fact, my wife gave her seat to another newly married couple so that at least they may go together. While coming, we made sure to reach early at the airports and could luckily get the two seats together both the times in 9th row ( up to Mahe)  and 19th row (from Mahe to Mumbai). I think that Seychelles Air can do much better job by planning it well, esp. when they know before hand that passengers are mostly Honeymooning couples and that flights are full! In today's times, Web Check in is the least they can do!The food was good but service by hostesses was run of the mill. The water to me was served almost one hour despite the request light being on for full hour. No arrangement for water or charging of phones at Mahe Airport are big lacunae in travelling  with Air Seychelles. The timings of travel are very odd. You are sapped of your energy by the time you land or fly. Hope officials take note of above problems and do something to improve passenger experience in future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/6f/e1/ad/vinod-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinodkumat,Vinod K wrote a review Feb 2016,Vinod K,"Mumbai, India",128 contributions,40 helpful votes,Mumbai - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r350741573-Air_Seychelles-World.html,"No Web check in and Not Helpful or smiling staff, bad planning of seats",Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I fly to Seychelles often for business. Sometimes Business sometimes Economy class. Being a gold member of Etihad, I try to use them as I get good perks and upgrades. However,  Etihad bought a stake in Air Seychelles and practically runs it, meaning that most flight from Abu Dhabi to Seychelles are operated by Air Seychelles. Air Seychelles claims to be awarded Indian Ocean’s Leading Airline - Business Class. Great, but there are not that many airlines to complete against. The fleet is not so good, planes are leased and they have seen better times. What does gets on my nerves is the crew and the announcements. They talk  A LOT! crew always chatting, even during the night flights, you can hear them gossiping at the back. When the announcements come, they repeat them in French, English, Creole, sometimes in Arabic and sometimes even in Chinese. If yo want to sleep, forget it, they will keep telling you to buy duty free and fasten seatbelts throughout the flight, in 3 languages at least!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/0e/eb/ac/rinaldm2014.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RinaldM2014,Rinald M wrote a review Feb 2016,Rinald M,"London, United Kingdom",183 contributions,80 helpful votes,Abu Dhabi - Victoria,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729012-r345264474-Air_Seychelles-World.html,"Unfortunately have to use them to Seychelles flights, but trying to change",Date of travel: December 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
