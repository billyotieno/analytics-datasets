I won't recommend this airline due to being disorganised.

"I was supposed to fly from Malawi to Rwanda (Kigali) on Monday 21 November, and I had to fly from Blantyre to Lilongwe (Malawi), Harare, Lusaka to be able to catch the plane to Kigali with Rwandair. I went through this hassle because then at least I could arrive in the evening (21.30h) and have a normal night rest. I paid around 300 euro extra for that purpose.
When I arrived in Lusaka, they informed me that my flight to Kigali was cancelled. I ended up travelling via Addis, to arrive 00.45h in Kigali, arriving around 02.00 at my guesthouse.
I am very dissappointed that I wasn't informed in time, so I could have been flying Blantyre, Addis, Kigali. I complained at the customer service. They apologised and were friendly, and gave me an email address to claim back my extra costs. Let's see if that is going to work.
Currently i am awaiting a Rwandair flight from Kigali to Kamembe (west Rwanda), supposed to be flying at 07.00h. Because of problems with their aircrafts we have to wait for an aircraft to arrive from Kenya (supposed to arrive at 5.45am, but scheduled to arrive at 09.09am). I was planning to facilitate a workshop today. This is going to start late.
They told me this is a temporary problem, and should be sorted once their aircrafts are repaired. What about hiring another aircraft in the meantime?
I had a positive experience with Rwandair in the past, so let's hope they get back on their feet.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ditteked,Ditteke d wrote a review Nov 2022,Ditteke d,"Blantyre, Malawi",5 contributions,1 helpful vote,Blantyre - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r869419973-RwandAir-World.html,Poor communication,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Customer service is poor - no sense of urgency and the responses are neither transparent nor fully informative. I canceled a reservation within 24 hours of payment. To my horror, I discovered the customer call centre they have is in Kigali. This number was not in use! I managed to get email addresses to contact from their office at CPT airport and their official twitter account. However, the responses to my email requests for a refund were lethargic and not transparent. It has now been 3 days and all I know is that the tickets I bought were non refundable. and that only airport taxes are refundable. I was not given information as to how to start this process. My booking references are non existent and I am stuck in limbo not knowing the options available to me at this time. You will note that their ticket price does not include a breakdown of these costs and this complicates matters. So their twitter page advised me to wait for the breakdown. I have also been informed that I will be penalised for rescheduling. If you want value for your money, use other airlines. A friend of mine got her money back after canceling Airlink flight 48 hours after booking minus all these hassles I have been through. Besides that, their flights have been delayed on some trips i have taken with them and their engine is noisy especially if u sit at the back.
In summary, Rwandair is not value for money and Airlink is cheaper and hassle free for those doing the CPT-HRE route.

"Lusaka to Kigali 12 October 2022. Few days before departure I contacted the airline’s office in Lusaka as the flight appeared not to be to sold anymore and hardly could be full. They answered back within 1 hour and gave detailed confirmed, entire itinerary (incl. coming flights). Check-in counters opened pleasantly early, 3½  hour prior departure, so no queues or waiting time. The man at counter advised on seating and showed me configuration and options on his computer. We selected the best options, though I was later further upgraded onboard to have the most spacious seat in economy. Security, health documentation, immigration took less than 10 Minutes. Their partnership with Qatar rendered me access to Pearl lounge in the terminal. There was some discussion whether I was qualified, but in 5 Minutes after some photocopying, they let me in. The lounge is 3rd party, and acceptable with Wi-fi, hot foods, wines and cold beers. Onboard, my preordered special meal though I had to remind them, and it took some time to avail it. Drinks and customer care onboard was very pleasant, nothing was too much, but it took a lot of time as the FAs discussed and recommended drinks to almost every passenger. IFE was only a flight monitor, but the music channels offered a lot. Had to use own headphones. No WiFi, old aircraft, but well maintained. Good announcements from pilots. Noisy aircraft, this B737-800. Flight on time, we arrived 15 Minutes earlier than scheduled. Luggage arrived before I even passed immigration. DreamMiles to their FFP was given me after just 1 day after landing.

"Pros staff are polite and nice.
Some times the food is good at times terrible not consistent
Smoking booth in lounge if connecting through Kigali
Cheaper than most airlines to east and Southern Africa

Cons
-Always late take off and taxi.
-Your luggage will be battered mangled and destroyed.They managed to destroy two of my bags despite being wrapped.
-Had a roach climbing me whilst on the flight
-Might take you 3 hours to collect your luggage at T3 Heathrow. Not great after a 17 hour flight.
-No visible representative at T3 Heathrow airport baggage claim.
-Flight times do change a lot especially for those with advance tickets.
- issues with toilets as they are usually messed up during the flight
- exit door food trays are worn cracked and broken

"Flew DOH-KGL-LUN 10-11 Sept. 2022 on two different B737 versions. This, in conjunction with QR from Bangkok. QR is new partner of Rwandair and it functions despite some hiccups on ticketing, pricing, FFP. Partnership with Qatar Airways is incomplete and unclear: e.g. issued tickets are only partly compatible and manageable on both airlines. Granted lounge access in Doha after a short discussion and some photocopying. Both flights on time. Very noisy aircrafts, very limited IFE. Food very good, as always. Special meal delivered to perfection. Additional meals were offered and I tested them as also being good, and well cooked. FA’s are very friendly and caring, all stunning elegant, more than 6 feet tall, well rested, humorous, and confident. Transfer in Kigali smooth, was granted access to Pearl lounge after a short discussion (not clear whether a QR gold card gives you access as most QR-frills do not apply for their partners like smaller, non-OneWorld airlines). Luggage: no issues. Flights on time. IFE poor but present. Manage to change FFP from Qatars’ Priv. Club to Rwandairs’ Dream-Miles at the gate in Doha to maximise earnings on both programs. The airlines’ frequent flyer programs are reciprocal only within limitations, thus I had to split the Mileage earnings to 2 programs according to sectors.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andersp536,Anders P wrote a review Sep 2022,Anders P,,40 contributions,25 helpful votes,Doha - Lusaka,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r861670245-RwandAir-World.html,Love and care their passengers,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've travelled with Rwandair about 8 times this year and every experience has been wonderful. They are the most child friendly airline that I've been on, they are warm, patient and kind toward parents with kids.

Recently I flew alone with my two toddlers, once the staff noticed that my kids were irritable they immediately stepped in to speed up the check in process, to take my bags for me to the boarding gate so that I could carry my babies, then on the airline they constantly checked in on me, lent an extra hand where I needed it and treated my kids with kindness.

On a previous flight when my little kid was still an infant, the air host made the effort to offer an easier seat, helped me move and assured me that he was available at any time I needed a hand, he meant it.

Travelled to Harare with this airline and lost 3bags out of 5 on arrival. There is no sympathy or apology from staff when we were trying to locate our baggage. One member of staff called it normal and appeared unapologetic instead we seemed to be the problem making efforts of locating our baggage. We got 50USD which didn't meet our needs as a family of 5. The staff would promise to contact you and you don't hear from them. The only person who was responsive is James Nkurunziza by email. At least he expedited for us to get our baggage. I have young children and will not use this airline or recommend anyone to use it. When coming back to the UK the flight was delayed and the kids got so irritable.

"Our experience with Rwandair was honestly brilliant, staff were lovely food was good but what let them down was that on arrival im Harare they lost all our luggage - 6 bags in total. We were told we MIGHT get them on the next flight in 2 - 3 days. As we were travelling on from Harare the next day for 7 days we had to rush around and buy necessities and clothes for 7 days for 3 people, this was a huge expence to an already costly holiday. On flying back to the UK 3 weeks later, our luggage was lost again this time 2 suitcases. All travellers who didn't get luggage were travelling from Harare. It is unacceptable for an airline to be leaving luggage behind especially due to the cost of air tickets and the inconvenience it is causing people who are using this service. It is incredibly disappointing as the cost of  the flight and the time taken to travel suited us very well however I am not sure we will fly Rwandair again because of this. One incident of lost luggage is tolerable but to happen twice on the same trip is not acceptable. Still waiting too be informed as to when our luggage will arrive. No communication from them to us until I emailed to find out what is happening and currently have no idea when our luggage will arrive. They will be in touch......waiting patiently.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellbellzim,shellbellzim wrote a review Aug 2022,shellbellzim,,2 contributions,,London - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r856578086-RwandAir-World.html,Disappointed,Date of travel: August 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've flown with Rwandair multiple times over the last few years now, and whilst they don't have all the frills, they have always had good service, comfy seats and been great value... until today.

Travelling with my 4 month old baby, I stood for over an hour at the check in desk (this doesn't include waiting to be served), we were late departing, snotty service on board, warm drinks and a shambles as far as seat allocations were concerned. Delayed in Kigali, chaotic connecting flight to Harare and to top it off, not one of our family's 7 checked bags arrived. Apparently over 70 bags were deliberately left in Kigali, surely thats half the plane? Speaking to locals, this is apparently a routine occurrence, leaving a permanent sea of luggage (missed off the previous flight) waiting for collection.

"I was supposed to fly to SA on the 25th but there was an issue with my visa because it was hand written and some parts were badly filled out, like they rushed it. So that airline, ASKY said I would have to go back to the SA embassy to rectify the problem - that was how I missed that flight, then yesterday, I went and got the visa corrected at VFS and also got an email from the SA embassy validating the visa in case anyone asked questions. I got to the airport, but the next ASKY flight to SA would be on Thursday, so the organizers of the program I'm going for, booked a one way flight on Rwand Air so I could fly yesterday. The lady looking through my papers noted the changes on the visa and I showed her the email. She took it to her boss and came back and nothing more was said about the visa. Instead, they looked at my flight itinerary and said my return ticket had no ticket number - the return ticket is with SAA. I got the organizers to send the ticket number but the lady at the desk said her boss said I must get a return ticket with Rwand Air and she said I should wait to appeal to the boss. I kept waiting and he didn't come. That was when I finally lost it and sat on the floor and raked for them but no one answered me. Until I took a video of them, saying what they had done to me. Then the managers and officials of the airline and FAAN came and the issue now became about me making a video and that was basically what I was punished for. I was taken to their crime unit and they got even more upset that I tweeted about what was happening to me. So I was detained for long then taken the police station and accused me of unruly behaviour and of bringing 'doctored' visa and the airline manager now appeared and said he was trying to explain to me that the issue was with the visa and that I could be sent back by SA immigration and if that happened, then I would have to buy a ticket with them and claimed that I refused to listen to anyone. These were all lies. No one told me anything about my visa still being the issue - they just said I had to buy a new ticket. I wasn't allowed to say my side of the story. It was only Rwand Air, the police and airport officials talking and accusing me of all sorts of things and making me, the victim, into the villain. Then they forced me to write an apology letter at the police station after threats of jail or a fine of 250,000. They made me take down the video and tweets and make another video debunking the firs video. Then they let me go. The Rwand Air manager was 'magnanimous' enough to say that they could let me fly the next day, but I must sign an undertaking that if I am sent back by SA immigration, I must pay for my return ticket.

Yesterday me and my brother travelled to Zim. We didn't find one bag  on arrival. Speaking for myself this is really hurtful. My brother doesn't have any clothes to change as we speak. The worst thing is noone from the airline was there/made any effort to communicate what might have happened with our bags. Noone communicated properly when we can expect our bags. A huge company providing services to many people should at least show some concern for customers and communicate any inconveniences. We were made to fill forms by some agents at the airport who didn't seem have much knowledge on what we should expect because there was noone from the airline to help. Can we at least know how  we can be sure that we receive our bag on Wednesday and what time. Because the service seems unreliable. How can we know where our bag is and if it's safe. Was my first time travelling with Rwandair and I must say such a disappointing experience. Bags get lost/don't get packed but it can be better if someone can communicate to clients.

"My flight by Rwandair got cancelled early March: they let us wait for 6 hours in the airport (after supposed departure time) without any information ! This is not how a decent airline is expected to treat its customers . We got booked on a new flight two times, meaning two times, we got back to the airport to find out completely at the end, before boarding, that we could not board the other aircraft as the flight was fully booked. I never experienced this ever before in my life (and have been going thorugh quite some candellatuobs so far).

Moreover, I tried claiming a refund but customer service is almost unreachable and tries to avoid responding my questions. They say it is not possible to claim a refund etc. nor refund costs incurred for excess luggage at another airline (where they rebooked us on), but when I ask where I can see proof of this statement, all goes silent and I don't get answers anymore. Hence I highy doubt their fairness in way of approaching refunds/claims etc.

Just a message: please, be aware when you are flying this company and better don't do so, in order not to experience the same hassle as I unfortunately encountered. I learned a valuable lesson not to fly ever again with a company of cheaters like this one, at least...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123dirkdr,DirkDR wrote a review Jun 2022,DirkDR,Republic of North Macedonia,3 contributions,,Kigali - Brussels,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r843550499-RwandAir-World.html,Most horribly customer service I have ever encountered,Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The pilots are all well established and the flight in general was comforting and able to sleep without any alerts to tighten sit belts. Therefore the pilots get 10/10 from me.

Checking in: no information about check in requirements were provided so it was very easy to miss a flight due to lack of information. One of the requirements was a covid test and persenger locator form but this information was not given before hand. Luckily I called the airline a few hours before my flight.

Some of the Aircraft attendants were unprofessional. I was in the toilet when she started banging on the door asking me to get out. When I opened the door she asked me to go back to my sit but there was no emergency. We were waiting for others to board the plain from Brussels.
The stop over at Brussels was not showed on the air ticket. And while we wait there we are not allowed to stand up or to walk to be able to stretch. They keep asking as to go back to our sits and fasten our sit belts:(

When they want your attention they just touch you without asking to be excused.

I was one of the 10 people to check in but I was allocated the bottom last sits next to the toilet in both crafts yet they were many empty sits on both crafts.
I was not happy with that.
I also hated the waiting of 4,hours in Rwanda and I found the Rwandese very rude at the airport when we arrived.
You can easily miss your flight because there are no clear information during the transit long hours.
The food was not great either. I would have preferred eating Rwandese traditional meals to rice and curry that was restless.
For those reason, I will try to avoid travelling with this flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3002GTbs,B S wrote a review Jun 2022,B S,,1 contribution,,London - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r842737375-RwandAir-World.html,My 1st experience with Rwandair,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked a trip from Dubai to Cape Town in April 2022. The layover in Kigali was supposed to be approximately 2 hours. The night before the early morning flight out of Dubai an email notice was sent that an additional 5 hours of layover was expected. By that time changing flights or getting an alternative flight was not an option. The flight itself was not too bad, except it appears the control of customer baggage was not well controlled as several passengers were requested to hand over their carry on luggage to be placed with the checked in baggage just before the flight.
Kigali airport itself is small,but all the amenities are available, except for customer service. You need to hunt for a customer service representative if you need one.
The new departure time was 11:00am. Myself and my travel companion waited in the airport lounge until 10:45 (there was no announcement for boarding) before seeking out what was happening. The airport representative at that point only informed me that the flight was delayed by an additional hour. There was no PA announcement and no explanation except for""operational reasons"".
At around 12:00 we boarded the bus to the aircraft, where the baggage was still being loaded.
The flight only left at 12:20.
At this point I should point out another point of frustration which was only uncovered at Kigali airport.
Eventually when the announcement was made to board, I discovered that the flight was not going directly to Cape Town but instead stopping at Harare, Zimbabwe to drop off and then pickup passengers. At no point in the booking process was this apparent. Really frustrating, and deceptive in my opinion.
I really would like to see this airline succeed, but with the current level of service I fail to see that happening as it would take an extreme set of circumstances to book with Rwandair again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayk944,ay k wrote a review May 2022,ay k,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",6 contributions,,Dubai - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r837312757-RwandAir-World.html,The art of failed communication,Date of travel: April 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Just want to express my disappointment with the way how am being treated, l booked a flight from uganda to London in Dec which was cancelled due to Covid-19, and our tickets where put on hold, when we were ready to travel Rwandair didn't have flights, we requested for a refund in December, written several emails but got only about 3 belated replies, called several times which is very costly only for the line to be cut off
More than 3 months my money isn't refunded with the excuse of we're very busy with lots of emails.
This is very unfortunate and unprofessional to treat customers like gabbage after getting their money.
I have been very patient but it's getting out of hand, they requested me for all ticket details but nothing was done todate and my money is being used in the business.
Please style up your customer service and know that every customer needs to be happy with the service to keep the business afloat.

"We treated ourselves to business class as both out and inbound flights were overnight and business class with RwandAir not as expensive as with some of the larger carriers, but still offers a flat bed.

The layout in business class is good and the seats /beds relatively comfortable and wide and able to accommodate a six foot person. Pillow is a little small and no mattress provided but was fine.

Aside from meeting the flat bad requirement, I can't be especially positive.

Whilst I appreciated I would be changing planes in Kigali I hadn't been made aware there would be a lengthy refuelling stop in Brussels. Every flight was delayed with little information provided as to what was happening each time. We were over 3 hours late back into the UK.

Service wasn't great with ground crew especially unhelpful. Minimal in flight drink and food service and business class lounges weren't very good either with uncomfortable seating and little in the way of food - Entebbe was better than Kigali.

"1. You cancelled my flight. It was your decision. I was not consulted The least I expected was for you to process my refund without me even asking for it.
2. I multiple correspondences with Flight Network. They sent several emails asking me to reply to their email so that they can start the process of refund. I have not heard from them since beginning of December. They sent me from pillar to post giving me a number that I was supposed to get hold. That number does not work. They asked me to get hold of their sister department. How unreasonable is that? Why cant flight network customer service get in touch with its sister department?
3. I feel fleeced by big organisations who hid behind fingers of institutional arrogance.
a. I bought all my tickets through flight network
b. Flight Network obviously sent my money to Rwandair.
c. Rwandair cacelled my flight when I was in Dar es Salaam. There was no need for me to still fly from Dar es Salaam to Kigali if my Kigali to Harare had been cancelled.
d. I had to buy a new ticket to fly from Dar es Salaam to Johannesburg directly to avoid being stranded in Kigali.

This issue caused antlers hour delay while she tried to gain approval from somewhere to make the move.  Then told us we had to get Nairobi to make all the changes  since the tickets originated from there (really?).  I suggested she fly us to Nairobi and we’d handle it when we got there, LOL.  All in all it cost us two extra days of vacation and an additional $2300 just with RwandAir and I haven’t even gotten into the airport fiasco requiring 3 covid tests in 3 days, visas to enter back into Kenya that were NOT required by Kenya.

"To avoid losing RwandAir DreamMiles points, two award tickets were booked on a domestic return trip to Cyangugu/Rusizi. Process to redeem points was really straight forward and DreamMiles Team in Kigali was rather efficient as they issued these tickets after 2 days.

Check in and security were a breeze, I like the fact that we can use the international RwandAir lounge - which was nice - even for a short domestic leg.

Another good point is that premium pax get to board a dedicated business class bus. As it was raining, we were glad to be able to wait in the comfortable armchairs inside the bus before reaching a real J cabin/seat on propeller aircraft.

In flight, outbound there was no service at all not sure if its covid related or not, because inbound (Kamembe - Kigali) a diffrent crew served us a pre-departure glass of champagne and we even got a refill once in the air while cruising for 10 min.

While the business lounge at Kamembe surprisingly exists, this is nothing to write home about.

To sum up, we did not expect any kind of service especially during covid + very short flight, however the return leg made us thinking why a big change with their protocol of service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore311019,Habitant du monde wrote a review Mar 2021,Habitant du monde,,9 contributions,,Kigali - Cyangugu,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r785602738-RwandAir-World.html,RwandAir and its inconsistent service,Date of travel: March 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I WILL NEVER AGAIN FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!!!!!
I was flying from Dubai to Gabon and my boyfriend and I had one carryon bag each . Once we got to the departing time at the gate , they begin to weight everybody carryons bag and asked people to pay for the extra weight. They told my boyfriend and I we have 5kg extra each and we need to pay $500 for it . At the cashier we gave them our credit card to pay and the refused saying they only take cash . We didn’t have cash so they asked us to just throw the extra weight to trash if we want to fly . WE WERE SHOKED TO HEAR THAT !!!!! We were in one of the most developed city in the world and we couldn’t use our credit card . We even ask them if they can keep our bags so we can pay cash for it once we get to Gabon because we couldn’t find cash right now at the airport we already spent our daily cash withdrawals limit . They refused all our proposals and asked us to pay cash or trash our staff . At the end they were about to close the gate and we had no choice but the leave our bags there and take the flight. Once we got to Kigali we asked to speak to an agent and he said they don’t deal with issues regarding Dubai and there is nothing they can do about it . Same thing in Libreville . Finally we lost our valuable stuff worth more than $15000 and I will never forget that . Plus we were not the only case that day . They did many people the same thing . The only advice I can make is to NEVER TAKE THIS COMPANY.

The airline at first told me that i checked in two peices of bags instead of one and then later i came to find out that one bag had been left in South Africa and then the other was sent to NIGERIA instead of Tanania.
Everyday i get promises to get my luggage back the next day but until this day i have not received my bags and no compensation at all for this negligence.

"Flew Kigali to Dar es Salaam (on 8th November 2020) and back a week later. Convenient flying times (mid-day out, and afternoon home). Both flights were on the same aircraft, a De Havilland DHC-8, called “Dash 8”. This is a propeller, which is small (80 seats?) and noisy. Not many passengers on the outbound, but full on homebound. Cheap, promotional ticket (250 USD) with generous luggage allowance. Both flights on time. Free seat selection at check-in. Special seafood meal accommodated both ways and extra food provided on request. Check-in smooth and Cabin crew polite and efficient. A short stop in Kilimajaro airport on the way back went smooth. The Covid tests requirements (both ends, and again on arrival Kigali, total 3 tests!) are a nightmare and costly (150 USD); further comes 1-day quarantine at arrival in Rwanda, but one cannot fault the airline for this.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp,Anders P P wrote a review Nov 2020,Anders P P,,23 contributions,6 helpful votes,Kigali - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r777218478-RwandAir-World.html,"Well done, Rwandair",Date of travel: November 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Recently used the airline from Dubai, booking went well, I checked in, they weighed my bags, everything was smooth.
Before boarding the plane, I passed through the dubai duty free, picked up a few things that weighed 7 kgs. Just before we boarded, 3 gentlemen with a weighing scale brought a weighing machine and asked us (people who had dury free bags) to weigh our bags. They weighed and was found to have more than the 3 kgs allowed, I was made to pay for the extra weight. Something which didn't make me happy. They should have warmed me before I booked the airline that they dont allow past the 3 kgs for hand luggage.

I was super annoyed I have them the money and told them to keep the change. Very very disappointed. Am a frequent flier and all the airlines have used never weigh duty free bags. This is totally bad.

My connecting flight to Kenya was more than worse, they make us board a bombardier, which was smelling poop every 10 minute interval. The smell was so bad that after we landed I threw up and my stomach was bloated because of the bad smell from the toilet. I have never flew on a bombardier before, but I think when you value your customer, you have to make them feel valued. I didn't feel the value of my money at all and I will never tell my friends to try and book this airline. It will be my first and last time booking this airline.

The staff in general were smiling, which is a good thing, they were helpful. Which I appreciate a lot. But the ladies need more training if rwanda air wants to put itself on the map of aviation industry in africa. They were pathetic, especially their hair. Rwanda has beautiful women, but presentation matters alot. So please do something about presenting these beautiful african hostesses. They are beautiful but I think they need a little bit more in terms of hair style and attitude towards customers.

Otherwise thank you rwandair but I will never use this airline again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone out there.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riridabs,Riridabs wrote a review Mar 2020,Riridabs,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",9 contributions,12 helpful votes,Doha - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r751752121-RwandAir-World.html,A bad ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On one of my many tight schedules this time to facilitate another Teambuilder for the World Bank ITS Africa Workshop at the exquisite Marriott hotel in Kigali.

After having flown in their Bombardier planes on my previous visits, I was pleasantly surprised to fly onboard their Boeing 737-700 series flight WB 465 Kigali bound via Entebbe at 5.00am. As we commenced our descend into Entebbe we hit serous turbulence, the plane bobbed and bounced and sent fear among passengers, but the calm voice of the Captain calmed everyone down and we were soon out if it, touching down at Entebbe at 6.00am. Plenty to keep busy onboard the IKAZE Boutique duty free Magazine with great gift items and also the INZONZI in flight magazines with a great of stories in them. Incidentally I was standing right outside the toilet when the turbulence started and was very impressed by the professionalism of the cabin crew one of them reminding me with a broad smile to be cautious and to hold on to something inside there. All in all it was a pleasant flight with great on board service by the entire Team. My flight back into Nairobi was on the Bombardier pleasant flight departing on time and arriving on schedule.

"we make the mistake of flying with Rwandair in the beginning of November 2019 - no customer service, unexplained delay in flights, no slightest care for passengers that stuck waiting for 6 hours at the gate - not even a cup of water or coffee and on top of it all luggage get broken somehow on the way and my wife suitcase arrived broken and missing one wheel . on arrivals at the airport ,we presented the broken suitcase to the person at the  baggage services counter , he inspected it and issued me with a note - a damage report . I was instructed to go to a certain shop with the broken suitcase and the damage report  , so it will be replaced with an equivalent suitcase .When I arrived to the shop I was presented with some cheap suitcase that was not of the same size nor the same quality or type -  furthermore, when I pointed out the differences between the 2 suitcases I was told by the shop assistant that if I want the same type of suitcase I’ll have to pay $300 - $400 extra .  since then no communication whatsoever  possible - no returning  calls nor email -  until a month later ,after facebook post, i got a reply from their facebook page  but nothing since then - until today  it is January - still avoiding the problem and removed the facebook coment line ..... shame on them what a crappy service  - never again .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malamud11,ארז wrote a review Jan 2020,ארז,,4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cape Town Central - Tel Aviv,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r737574666-RwandAir-World.html,Rwandair - worst airline customer care possible,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Experienced RwandAir's world class service from Mumbai to Kigali

It was a wonderful experience to fly the Dream of Africa on RwandAir's direct and nonstop flight from Mumbai to Kigali ( WB 501 on Sunday 24 November)

The service was absolutely excellent, with both flight attendants, Yvette and Aime, going out of their way to make not just my Travel most enjoyable and comfortable, but also that of all business class passengers.

Inflight service was par excellence.

Would definitely recommend RwandAir which brings you into Kigali in less than seven hours.

Enticed by the affordability of their fares and good reviews I travelled to Harare from Dubai on the 2nd of December 2019 on Flight WB110 with Rwandair. The check in process was lengthy and chaotic with passengers checking in multiple pieces of luggage which were mostly wrapped up crates. It looked more like a freight carrier than a commercial airline. The flight itself was fairly comfortable. Upon arrival in Harare we stood for a good 40 mins before questioning why our baggage was taking so long. That's when we were told that the plane had proceeded to Cape Town by the local luggage handlers and that there was no luggage. We were advised to file a report but there was no indication of when that luggage would arrive. There was no Rwandair rep on site and an email sent to their email address was returned as undeliverable. So all 10 passengers had to proceed without their luggage and no information. I live 400km away from Harare and had to be in at work the following day minus my luggage. Not to mention the distress of not knowing when it would arrive and the cost of travelling 400km back. Greatly disappointed. Would strongly recommend not to use them. Spoilt the end of my holiday.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey728967,Odyssey728967 wrote a review Dec 2019,Odyssey728967,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Dubai - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r730225452-RwandAir-World.html,Priced too good to maintain quality of service!

"As a Kenyan I was very excited to be using Rwandair for my round trip from JKIA to DXB via Kigali for my vacation. On my return flight, all my bags were left in DXB and this was never communicated to me after spending 2 hours at JKIA until I went to the baggage claim desk. My bags were then delivered to JKIA (not even to my doorstep) in piece-meal and I had to use my fuel and parking fees each time I went to pick at JKIA. On my return flight from DXB to JKIA via Kigali, the staff were asking passengers to hold or keep very big backpacks under the seat keeping in mind what little leg room the flights have in Economy class. It would seem they allowed very many hand luggage that the big suitcases and bags were given priority and passengers had to hold them for 6 hours!!! How unprofessional!!! The food is very average and there is no in-flight entertainment for all planes used in the round trip!! I will never use Rwandair.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller_kenya,Traveller_kenya wrote a review Nov 2019,Traveller_kenya,,6 contributions,12 helpful votes,Dubai - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r726320869-RwandAir-World.html,Lost baggage!!!

"I choose to fly Rwanda Air because a friend of mine who is from Rwanda promised me i won't regret it. Its price is less compared to the other available flights from other airlines and that was a plus for me. I boarded from DXB terminal 2 and there was a stopover at Kigali to connect to Nigeria. The young man that checked me in at DXB T2 was very nice to get me a seat next to the window and there was enough space for my leg since I'm very tall(thanks to him). The connecting flight from Kigali to Nigeria was supposed to leave at 9AM, however it was delayed until some minutes past 10AM. Upon arrival at Abuja airport, i was waiting for my luggage at the luggage point and i discovered that my luggage wasn't there. I approached 1 of the staffs working there and informed him i cannot seem to find my luggage, which he then told me that 3 passangers luggage were left over in Kigali and mine was 1 of them. That alone spoiled all my plans, i never expected them to leave behind any luggage since they had enough time from my arrival to kigali to when we departed from kigali(over 4 hours). My Vacation is for a week in Nigeria and i was told my luggage will arrive with the next flight after 2 days. I don't live in Abuja, i will have to travel to Abuja to get my luggage and then travel back. All my plans for this vacation has been ruined because of this, i cannot see how Rwanda Air can make up for this. After my return to Dubai with them in a few days, i don't see my self flying Rwanda Air anymore. I hope i get my luggage on Wednesday.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulganiyub,Abdulganiyu B wrote a review Nov 2019,Abdulganiyu B,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2 contributions,2 helpful votes,Dubai - Abuja,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r725762376-RwandAir-World.html,Lost Luggage,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The planes are new, really comfy. The staff are really exceptional and honesty the best airline food I've had for a long time. The in flight entertainment is limited, a few films and the odd episode of TV programmes, however, it's sufficient. If this airline flew through any airport other than Kigali it would easily be 5 star, however, it is let down by the airport transfer at Kigali.
The security are rude and slow, not only do they xray your bag they rifle through almost every bag to see if there is anything worth taking. Even though internationally you can carry a lighter or a box of matches at Kigali they are contraband, both in hand luggaga and checked in, and they will destroy your back to get to them, even Dubai security is better than this. Once you get passed this nonsense you are ussured into the gates, a big room, no food, no drink unless you go out of security so they can make you look like a criminal again on the way back. NOT an international airport but a regional airport with its own set of rules and people who just want to feel important.

"We flew from Tel Aviv to Nairobi through Kigali. The seats and legroom were OK. Of the 4 flights, in 2 flights the crew were great, and paid attention to detail, while in the other 2, it was not the case. In the latter case, we did not get the meals we asked for (vegetarian Jain meal), and in one of these two, the air hostess tried to give us just 2 pieces of boiled potato and 2 pieces of grilled zucchini as a meal. When we approached the customer care, they were apologetic and just kept asking us to write an online complaint.

We did experience a 24 hour delay on the return leg, these things happen, RwandAir dealt with it professionally and correctly, putting us up in a very nice Hotel and keeping us informed as the situation evolved, again excellent customer service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/50/d2/5e/adam-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adambC7788RJ,Adam B wrote a review Sep 2019,Adam B,"Cowes, United Kingdom",26 contributions,6 helpful votes,London - Lusaka,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r708052807-RwandAir-World.html,"Great staff, great service and excellent value for money",Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This airline ought to be scrapped!!! I travelled from Dubai to Nigeria via Kigali on the 31st of August with my family. The first surprise was the way the ground staff shoved my 5 year old daughter back in to the bus at the point of boarding. As if that was not bad enough, getting on board i discovered that there are no personalized in flight entertainment on board a 5hr plus flight. For the first 1hr of boarding, the air conditioning was turned off. This was not rectified until the plane took off and reached its cruising altitude. At this point everyone had to devise all sort of things as hand fan. All the while, the cabin crew where just non chalant. The treatment meted out to passengers by the Rwandan police at the point of connection is another piece for another day. The final straw was when i arrived in Lagos, Nigeria after over 12hrs only to discover that ALL my checked in luggages (4) were left in Dubai. The flimsy excuse was that the airline had to leave some luggages behind because of total weight of the aircraft.
Whereas in actual fact, Rwandair gives priority to luggages sent as cargo over luggages belonging to passengers who actually pay for these services.
1. Luggage allowance for 3 passengers is 46kg ×3 = 138kg
2. Total weight of my luggages was 85.3kg hence no excuse for leaving ALL my luggages in Dubai.

In conclusion, please RUN!!!!!!! From this airline as it is the Headquarters of fraudulent practices.

"Travelled for first time flight was delayed but airline did poor job of updating us from 7.30pm to 2am next day.
Got to Airport and check in was best described as chaotic it took ages although there were few business class passengers.
Priority boarding as per ticket was not adhered to .lounge at airport was crowded were offered refreshment vouchers but found that most places closed at that time.
Connecting at Kigali airport chaotic all economy passengers given use of business lounge so was overcrowded noisey and I didnt get a comfortable seat to rest for thus time an all day wait for connecting flight to Entebbe instead of short connection
Arrived at Entebbe and most passengers luggage left in Kigali mine too no explanation no apologies had to pick up next day in city center was contacted told luggage ready by 2pm got to office still not arrived.no apology staff surly and uncaring didn't greet acknowledge customers when we walked in I asked to see who was in charge young lady took it upon herself to tell be nobody in charge was in after I insisted she said he was busy in office.

"Me, and my family have had the worst experience with RwandAir!

Firstly, I had to contact Lastminute.com and RwandAir multiples times with regards to my tickets. I received several emails from both Lastminute.com and RwandAir with flight changes and still on the day that we travelled we was unsure of our flight schedule. To be honest all of the above signs were red flags and should I have known better, I would have cancelled my flights, and should have asked for my money back.

Rwandair are more concerned about people's money more than service and are legit fraudsters but I tell you one thing RwandAir will soon be declared bankrupt.

Our flights were delayed from Gatwick Airport and we was only informed of this once we had checked in our last piece of luggage at around 16.30pm. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 19.10pm on Saturday the 27th July but was told it was delayed until 22.45pm. We was given a voucher of £10 to compensate the delay lol. Around 21.00pm the boarding gate information screens constantly changed. At around 22.00p. We rushed to the boarding gate as we was told it was time to board but once we got to the gate there was zero communicstion and we was not informed of anything until almost midnight in which we was told that our aeroplane was still in Brussels. The aeroplane finally arrived to Gatwick in which we boarded after 2am and then left Gatwick around 3am. We then had to return to Brussels to collect more passengers after this we made our way to Rwanda. I forgot to mention that the aeroplane was filthy and disgusting, the toilets had no tissue this made my 12 year old nephew throw up as he was sitting on a dirty chair and the floors were filthy! Also the blankets smelt awful! Anyways as soon as we reached Rwanda again we was strung along multiple times, staff taking us around in circles with no answers. The airport staff had no clue what was going on after passengers started to show their frustrations, eventually we was informed that there were more delays and because we refused to wait in the airport it was then we was told we would be taken to a hotel. The staff at Rwanda Aiport had given us directions to go outside and find the coach but again no one was there. We constantly had to find staff for directions and confirmation but the staff were completely clueless.

We was made to wait on the coach for over 40 minutes before we was driven to the hotel to freshen up without no suitcases. :/ The the staff had no knowledge and the security were extremely rude with how they handled us. At the hotel, I was told I would be next door to my sister only to be put in the basement with no hot water or internet. I then had to make my way back to reception to ask where my sister was only to find out she was on the second floor. I asked them why we was not put toegther only to be told more excuses. Anyways our coach arrived to pick us up at 21.00pm. We reached the airport and had to wait a further three hours as our flight scheduled for 00.40am. We reached Tanzania on the 29th July after 5am!

My ticket was changed multiple times before my departure. Both Rwanda and lastminute.com were confused, lacked basic knowledge and information completely dismissed me and my concerns. I had travelled with my 5 year old son, 12 year old nephew along with my 60 year old mother and big sister.

The behaviour from the airline has been totally unacceptable, unprofessional and ruined our experience! Our children were upset, hungry, distressed and suffered extreme fatigue not only that but our holiday has been shortened and we missed a very important occasion that we can't get back!

We missed my cousins wedding! Thanks to RwandAir! I will never ever travel with your airline again and nor will I recommend your airline. RwandAir is on its way to being bankrupt! What a bloody joke!

Almost two weeks later and still waiting to be contacted with regards to a refund that I've constantly had to chase up.

"Where do I even start!? First of all, we were delayed in Guangzhou for over an hour, because “the plane arrived late”. And people joked that it was “African time”. The customer service was very rude. I am very observant and I could see how the flight attendants served the people. One lady in particular was very rude and never even out on a smile, and if you asked for something she would say rudely “it’s finished!”. There was only one lady I noticed. She was pretty amazing in attending to the passengers, very professional. The rest were all so unprofessional, looked like they just didn’t get any training. This didn’t just happen to me, but I was observing their behaviour the whole time. On arrival to Kigali I had to wait for about ten hours for my next flight to Nairobi. Now this is where things got interesting. Everyone else who had to wait for a long time was checked in to a hotel, and one guy told me to go and ask if I could be checked in too since I had to wait for about nine hours, and they said they wouldn’t check me in because I am from Kenya and there were many Kenyan flights each day? Wha kind of logic is that? Does that even make sense? Anyways I was the only one who had to wait all day in the lounge for my next flight while the rest were checked into the hotel. And since I have asthma, st some point I needed fresh air so I wanted to walk out, but the guard at the door stopped me, a certain woman, very sarcastic. She said she didn’t care, even if I had asthma attack and died, she said she didn’t care. This really shocked me and the other servers guard, a man, came and apologetically told me I couldn’t go but if I had difficulty breathing there was a first aid kit, I thought that was very professional of him and wondered why that other security guard was so mean and rude. I was literally in shock. I hope they will remember this. Worst nightmare of all time. My first time using it and won't ever do it again. I’ve spoken to people who’ve reported the same experiences especially with the ride customer service.

Worst customer service. 6days since I landed and I haven't been able to enjoy my trip because I have nothing to wear and am also sick worried is my luggage lost and with the kind of staff working hear I doubt I will get a definite response.

"Good News is Rwandair not only upgraded their aircrafts but also the quality of their Business Class services. We flew in the Boeing 737-800.

The planes have been refurbished to an as new feel. Could be new??? In-cabin service, food service, drinks service have gone up a few notches. Duty free service is now available. For us, the client service in general is now exceptional and customer responsive. My husband has glaucoma. Though he can walk, he requires assistance especially in those very long airport corridors.

On a previous trip we travelled with a Nigerian sportsperson whom everyone seemed to be greeting. I never realized how serious his condition was until a stretcher fetched him from the airport cabin, and an emergency team was ready for him just outside immigration.

I have been flying Rwandair from Accra to Johannesburg over five years now....always business class. I can charge my phone and iPad from my seat, watch movies from my individual screen, listen to the latest internal music, or enjoy their top quality cabin magazine is top quality.

The food and drinks menu reminds me of British Airways in quality, healthiness, and presentation. The drinks service is impeccable save for lack of honey and rooibos tea. South African rooibos is the in health tea. Black, white or green Rwanda tea would have been a lovely novelty.

This airline is price competitive and gives a 50% saving over flying direct from Accra to Johannesburg. There is a stopover in Lagos or Abuja, and a brief change of aircrafts in Kigali.

The Kigali Lounge is of international stands and beats Orly in Paris in bathroom quality.

Oh Boy, immigration is fussy even with transit passengers.

We have encountered business travellers and diplomats not flying their national career. Could be the routes, the service, or cost factor.

Door to door the trip is 10 hours. The downside or upside is the flight arrives at about 2am in Johannesburg. Check in is 11.30 returning.

The plus is Business Class passengers now have a 3 bag allowance each at 20kg. A fourth might be added if one has points. This comes in handy should an artifact or two catch your fancy, carry or bring back too many gift items, or enjoy shopping when travelling.


Nothing so far has motivated us to change. not even the fact that we always miss duty-free shopping.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/64/c7/cf/only1thebest.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/only1thebest,only1thebest wrote a review Jul 2019,only1thebest,"Greater Accra, Ghana",68 contributions,8 helpful votes,Accra - Johannesburg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r688203917-RwandAir-World.html,Better Service At Half The Price,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I and my family went to Serengeti in June 2019 by Rwand air from Mumbai to khilimanjaro airport via Kigali. While returning we had a horrible experience as the luggage of majority of passengers didn't arrive in Mumbai. We had a connecting flight to Kolkata so passengers were in a chaotic condition as most of our necessary stuff were in those bags. After lot of running here and there we submitted the forms to the authorities . The airlines told they would send the bags to our homes.Many passengers were bound for other places so without clothes and other essential items it was difficult so we had to purchase a lot of stuff to continue our daily routine.then we constantly mailed airlines and called them and after about 15days or so our bags were delivered to our homes intact. After repeated mails the company paid 80$ i.e 5600 rupees for four of us. The inconveniences we faced were faced likewise by many passengers. So think twice before choosing that flight.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/37/85/b7/sumanam34.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumanaM34,Sumana M wrote a review Jul 2019,Sumana M,,41 contributions,48 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r688169648-RwandAir-World.html,Regarding Rwand air,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew RwandAir and not only did each flight I took leave over an hour late each time, there was no communicaiton from RwandAir as to why.  They also did not load the whole plane of luggage for our flight to Johannesberg so every passenger on board did not have their suitcase nor was there any communicaiton again for this matter.  Then after filling out a lost baggage claim and being advised I would be contacted as the luggage was coming on the next flight and would be delivered I had to ring the airline 3 times and go and pick up my luggage myself.

"RwandaAir cancelled and rescheduled our flights multiple times and did not reissue our tickets - which made it difficult for operating carrier (ET) to find us in the system and check us in. After RW assured us that they have fixed our tickets, they again made changes to our returning flight from Kigali to Addis without informing us. We purchased a direct flight from Kigali to Addis departing at 16:20 and without informing us prior, they changed the flight to 15:15 (one hour earlier) with a stop in Bujumbura. When we arrived at the Kigali airport, Rwanda airline representatives were not transparent with us  about the stop in Bujumbura and the change of the flight times. When we wanted to receive some answers about the flight time changes and the sudden stop in Bujumbura, the airport staff became rude and tried blaming us for this situation (this discussion took place at 15:09 - and they seriously wanted us to proceed through security and immigration) when the departure time was 15:15. When I asked them if the aircraft is still there and if it will wait for us, they did not give me an answer. Hence we were not able to board the flight because of their failure to inform us about the flight cancellation and rescheduling - incredibly enough they did not want to take responsibility and in all seriousness told us that we had to purchase a new ticket for $900 per person!!! After holding us at the airport for 9 hours without eating and drinking, we spoke with airport security who finally decided that the airline was in the wrong and pressured the Rwanda Air staff to put us on a new flight (which was their responsibility all along). Rwanda Air is incredibly incompetent and unprofessional in providing customer support and service and have absolutely no training in how to treat their customers. Throughout our nine horrific hours at the airport, we were harassed by Rwanda Airline staff - and called ""liars who wanted to miss our flight"" by the head of Costumer Relations himself, Vincent  Nyarwaya. They put us into an incredibly bad situation and took no responsibility until they were forced to by airport security! In addition they lost our luggage, which still has not arrived in Addis! Do not take this airline, because you do not want to be stuck in their hands when they make mistakes and are unwilling to correct it.

"I was extremely sceptical about flying with this airline as I had read many terrible reviews after booking it. My whole trip I felt very scared, would we receive our luggage would we miss next flights etc.

However, I had no reason to worry. The flight was a Kigali - Lusaka with a quick stop in Johannesburg. In the short time the transfers were completed very fast and promptly, all the luggage came through etc. On the way back was the same.

The seats were comfortable and there were our individual TV’s. Headsets were handed and the entertainment was pretty good for a 2hr flight. The staff onboard were extremely friendly and helpful and I must say this was the airline where I have received the best customer service on board.

My only downside was the food. From what I remember we prebooked our meals, but they didn’t give what we asked for. Other than this, it was a great experience and I would most definitely recommend.

I feel because of all the negative reviews they do try go the extra mile and prove themselves- thats how it felt anyway.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750zahrap,Zahra P wrote a review Apr 2019,Zahra P,United Kingdom,165 contributions,20 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Lusaka,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r666895027-RwandAir-World.html,Much better than I had expected and would definitely travel again,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew on a narrowbody B737-800 at midnight on 2 March 2019 from Kigali to Dubai. Direct flight (in contrast to fly opposite direction). This aircraft has no lie flat seats which is a disaster for a night flights. I purchased the ticket in faith of their refurbished A330, but they made an equipment change obviously due to low load. Check-in online is a joke and waste of time: after filling some 7 pages with info online they eventually laconically inform that “check-in must be done in Airport”. Worst: landed in T2 in Dubai, which is a messy LCC terminal and fought my way to T1 for onward flights. Homepage misleading and systematically hide info on booking class. Even their most expensive bis-ticket give only few miles which furthermore only can be used on Rwandair. Lounge in Kigali is fine but they have blindfolded all windows with tape to deprive passengers any view of tarmac which is painful, embarrassing, and a misunderstood security issue. Luggage checked in to next destination only, thus had to fight again in Dubai for further luggage transfers. These 6 issues deprives good rating and we land at average at the highest. On the brighter side is the nice atmosphere onboard, great traditional Rwandan decorated interior in business cabin: FA’s were great and well caring. Champagne and welcome drinks provided. Menu cards and drink lists provided. Sparse supply, e.g. only one kind of beer and only two dishes offered for supper (only 2 options). The food was only passable but plenty. Breakfast of poor quality. Punctual airline with stunning, tall statuated FAs. However, their flight equipment is limited and they are not attached to any airline alliance, thus miles earning is only for their Dream Miles Program, which is very stingy with miles even for full fare business tickets. Will chose Kenya Airways and Ethiopian in future despite detours (over NBO or ADD) as they are considerably cheaper and mostly have a better product.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/0c/0f/6a/385andersp.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385andersp,385andersp wrote a review Mar 2019,385andersp,"Hue, Vietnam",36 contributions,44 helpful votes,Kigali - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r656457175-RwandAir-World.html,Waste of money,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I bought a beautiful giraffe souvenir that was my absolute favorite thing I had purchased in Africa. I carried it on my South African Air flight from Victoria Falls to Johannesburg. I carried it on my Rwanda Air flight From Johannesburg to Kigali. I carried it on my Virgin Atlantic flight from Johannesburg to London and London to Los Angeles. The ONLY problem I had was with an incredibly difficult and obstinate supervisor working for Rwanda Air in the Kigali airport. She insisted that this giraffe could be used as a weapon and that I had to check it as luggage. Now my giraffe was wrapped in some padding but no where near enough to be thrown under a plane. They said they would put a fragile sticker on it and it would be fine.

I proceed to get on the plane and can actually see the luggage truck out my window. I can see my giraffe is tucked to the right side of the luggage so I was feeling ok until I watched three suitcases fall on top of it and then the men loading the luggage tug on it multiple times to get it out from under some other bags. This was EXACTLY what I was afraid of and sure enough I unwrapped it when I got home and the entire nose area of my giraffe has broken off and one of the ears is broken off. I will try to glue it back together but it is incredibly disappointing that all the effort I put into keeping this giraffe protected while traveling through the country was all ruined because of one woman working for this airline.

Reading other reviews this seems to be a problem flying out of Kigali so for this reason I would not ever fly Rwanda Air out of Kigali ever again. In fact, if there is another option, I would choose to not fly this airline at all.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan1010,megan1010 wrote a review Jan 2019,megan1010,west hollywood,6 contributions,3 helpful votes,Kigali - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r648948569-RwandAir-World.html,Would Not Recommend,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight from London to Kigali was delightful, smooth and enjoyable. My return flight on the other hand was the complete opposite to  say the least. During the check in stage, I was told that I wouldn't be able to take a painting on board as it was ""too big"" - I can assure you that it was not.  Several airlines I've travelled with in the past have allowed me to take larger paintings and pictures on board and I was very surprised by his decision.  He told me that if i nwanted to travel with my painting  then, I'd have to pay $US 180 and check it in as a third luggage as I already had 2 suitcases. Now, to anyone with a sound mind that is a hefty price for a painting which didn't  even weigh a kilo but apparently it was more about the size as oppose to the weight. Imagine my surprise when I boarded the plane to find a painting (the owner confirmed it was a painting) larger than mine tucked behind the last row of seats in Premium Economy with a fragile sticker on it.  The man who checked in my luggage was explicit when he told me that my picture was too large to take on board with me and, yet  i was staring at a painting larger than mine. I couldn't believe my eyes.Once I'd gotten over the painting saga, I  was bemused to see someone sitting in my allocated seat. I told one of the crew member, I was told that my seat had been surrendered to a family of 4 because they wanted to sit together.  Whilst i appreciate that most families  want to sit together it's not fair to simply hand over seats that your ""other valuable"" customers have booked in advance for a variety of reasons.  Fortunately, I was allocated another window seat but there were countless passengers complaining that their seats had been allocated to other people willynilly.  What a complete farcical.Rwandair needs to be consistent with its rules and regulations. Luckily, i was able to return the painting to my hosts and arrange to have it sent to London by DHL.Rwandair needs to please  consider that your customers have a variety of reasons why they may book their seats in advance so, please honour their requests.If I ever fly with Rwandair again, it will be a moment too soon and it will be only be from London to Kigali.   I'll use a different airline for my outbound journey.        A generous 2 stars have been given for my outbound journey from London Gatwick to Kigali.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Beie,Travel_Beie wrote a review Jan 2019,Travel_Beie,"London, United Kingdom",68 contributions,73 helpful votes,London - Kigali,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r648357041-RwandAir-World.html,Discriminatory airline rules and complete chaos aboard the airline,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Prior to our flight we were greeted with pathetic customer service during the check in process. Our lay over in Kigali was equally as bad considering that there was no water and we were forced to spend a longer than planned wait in an area which was not big enough to accommodate all individuals awaiting their flight. Upon our return to SA, we received the wonderful news that our bags did not arrive. We were told that the bags were Kigali and was expected to be flown to SA in the next few hours. Of course, this was not true. It took the airline almost 40 hours to figure out that the luggage never even left Mumbai. During the waiting period, we struggled to get any answers or assistance from anyone working for the airline. Anyone we spoke to either didn't know what was going on or made it clear that this whole delay in luggage issue was also quite an inconvenience to them.

"I travelled to Dubai from Johannesburg with return flights. We were only informed that we would be stopping in Kigali for a layover, only to find out that the flight also stops in Lusaka for what felt like eternity. Also, the newer airbus that we were supposed to use was instead replaced by an old aircraft with limited leg room. I felt claustrophobic. Bear in mind that I travel economy often with SAA and other carriers but the space limitation imposed by Rwandair is just awful. Furthermore, I ordered specific meal plans ahead of time only to be told that they don't have requested meals for my family and I. The story was the same on the return flight. At least, the plane from Dubai to Kigali was newer and had better leg space and online entertainment. My meal plans were not fulfilled yet again. There was a stop in Mombasa again which we were not informed about. This meant that the flight was delayed this causing me to be late for my next domestic flight. I sometimes recieved food. The quality of the food was appalling. The rolls were especially hard. As in, I struggled to even take a bite. They were so stale. The food lacks flavour, desserts are sickly sweet and off-putting.

"It was my first time using the airline and was pleased to find the aircraft was very comfortable and modern. The crew were friendly and I generally enjoyed my flight.

My issues are;

1. When I bought my tickets, one condition was my first flight change was ""free"". When I tried changing my return date, I was charged $70!!!!! Why??? This is misleading! Further to that, the lady from customer care said $50 was a general fee for changing the ticket, while $20 was for the upgrade in Economy to another ticket class because that of my original ticket was unavailable. Shockingly when we boarded, the plane was only about 1/3 full!!!!! So I am almost certain my original ticket class was indeed available but they wanted to upsell.

2. The online facilities for check-in and for managing flight bookings etc does not work. Why? I don't know that either. Spoke to yet another staff member who advised that they don't check in passengers over the phone so we must go online but online check in was not working from their website.

3. An agent at the customer service desk seemed least interested and casually gave me a mobile number supposedly for the Head of Online transactions (or sth like that) to contact him on my own and explain to him. The line does not work.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babiryieM,babiryieM wrote a review Dec 2018,babiryieM,,50 contributions,7 helpful votes,Kigali - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r640252410-RwandAir-World.html,Good flight but frustrating customer service,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Landing in Harare a bit bumpy, but I suspect it is the state of the landing strip. Smooth landings in Kigali and Cape Town.

Fantastic crew staff and service.

I wish i could say the same of the ground staff in Kigali. Female staff in general lounge were rather aggressive. Same with those directing boarding on the ground. Check-in staff were helpful . Also smooth at passport control.
Meals were fine. Not luxurious and a bit on the saucy side , but fine for a beginner airline.

I seriously suggest checking the number of bags being brought onto the plane in Kigali. Passengers brought loads of bags, bumping passengers sitting and eventually we had to wait as there was no room for stowing later and bags had to be taken out again. Cause of delay?

"Overall it is good value for money however some areas left a lot to be desired.
Save yourself the bother of falling for the “economy flexi” rate which is just a clever way for the airline to make money- it doesn’t give you most of the advantages they so claim and when you try and query this they simply give you a non-comittal shrug. If you need a bigger baggage allowance just buy it when booking the flight it’s cheaper.
The entertainment selection was pretty decent and up to date.
The food and drink selection however was below standard and it was evident that class matters on this issue.

I have had to travel to the airport where the luggage was reported to arrive but it was not offloaded due to restrictions that is still do not understand and returned to Kigali losing valuable time and missing my appointments.In addition, the second trolley handle was completely broken.

"Dear Community, I am writing to explain you my bad experience with Rwandair, so hopefully it can dissuade you from flying with this company. On November, 10th, 2018, their flight to Kigali, to make our connection to Brussels, has been delayed. They offered us 2 options: to book us in the next flight...18 hours later; or to manage our booking ourselves and get refunded within a week. I chose the 2nd option, had to pay over 700€ and am now struggling for 3 weeks to get reimbursed. Indeed, even though they sent me an email to confirm I would be reimbursed, they are denying it and saying it won't happen.

"Flew A330-200 just over midnight on 30 Oct. 2018 from Dubai-Mombasa-Kigali. Aircraft very well maintained looked brand new. Terrible to make transit transfers in DXB, Had to struggle in the middle of the night with busses from T1 to T2 where there is always check in chaos and no signage nor separation of airlines. Had to insist on lounge access as the check-in counters could not care less about passengers. Was granted access to a sub par lounge in T2 called Marhaba. The bar sections was for smokers also so air was hazy. Poor boarding services: at gate on time but then shuttled around by bus for ages after waiting in the bus for 20 Minutes before it took off. Onboard nice atmosphere, great traditional Rwandan decorated interior in business cabin: FA’s were great and well caring. However, no menu cards nor drink list - sparse supply. Food acceptable and plenty. Champagne and other welcome drinks provided. IFE worked well. Seats very nice and spacious, I slept well. Got dinner at night and got a full breakfast from Mombasa to Kigali. Good airline, though not attached to any alliance. Ticket not cheap, otherwise could have rated 4/5. Miles instated wrongly (full fare ticket but gave only 50% miles).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/0c/0f/6a/385andersp.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385andersp,385andersp wrote a review Nov 2018,385andersp,"Hue, Vietnam",36 contributions,44 helpful votes,Dubai - Kigali,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r630633564-RwandAir-World.html,Good Product,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was my first flight with Rwandair. I had never heard of them let alone taking a flight with them.  I took this WB501 a 7373-800NG aircraft from Mumbai to Kigali. The aircraft was new.  The business class seat was standard. There was nothing exceptional about it. the crew was extremely polite and friendly. They certainly has an attitude of service with a smile so it felt much better.  While the flight left Mumbai almost 45 minutes late, it arrived in Kigali before time.  The flight was smooth. They offered some snacks and drinks and then offered breakfast. The breakfast was Indian. They provided an amenity kit which had some routine things such as a toothbrush, comb, eye mask, a pair of socks, lip balm, etc.  I took their flights from Kigali to Nairobi as well and returned the same way.

"This will be my first and last time to fly RwandAir.  .  I specifically looked on their website to see if they had a 7kg weight restriction for a carry on, but there was no mention of weight on the site.  When I got to the counter I was told that my carry-on bag was heavy and I needed to pay $46USD to check an extra bag.  I went to the office to pay and was told the fee was payable by cash only.  I left my bags at the counter so I didn’t have USD in the wallet I took.  I had to pay in Ugandan Shillings and they gave me a TERRIBLE exchange rate.  They told me I had to pay 184,000 UGX which equated to $53USD based on the exchange rate I received when I drew cash from my bank and that included the foreign exchange fee adjustment. According to my calculation the fee should have been 160,000UGX for the $46 extra bag fee.  They used an exchange rate of 4,600 shillings per $1 when the market rate is 3,700 shillings per $1.  I paid 185,000UGX and did not receive the 1,000 Shilling change so yet another way they over charged me.  Another inconvenience was that I had one bag that was 1kg over and one bag that was 2kg under.  They initially told me I had to move the 1kg to the other bag but when they saw my aggravation they told me not to worry about it.  After all of this I get on the plane and the plane is practically empty.  So they gave me all this grief about a few kg’s on a practically empty plane.  It’s complete nonsense in my opinion!The flight crew was very pleasant and the plane was clean and comfortable, but I would never subject myself to dealing with their check-in or business office again!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/3f/e3/03/livingdreamsjoyfully.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivingDreamsJoyfully,Latiesha Johnson wrote a review Aug 2018,Latiesha Johnson,"Temple, Texas",1108 contributions,87 helpful votes,Entebbe - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r610082719-RwandAir-World.html,Terrible Customer Service,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My partner and I arrived 3 hours before our flight. We checked in one bag each - both under 15kg when we each had an allowance of 2 x 23kg bags. When we asked to sit together on the flight the man laughed at us and said there were no seats left together and that if we wanted to sit together, we could go buy ourselves a new plane ticket for another day. Maybe this should've been a sign of what was to come...

After our flight, I was left standing at baggage reclaim for a whole hour, before myself and 29 others were notified that our bags had been deliberately left behind at Kigali Airport. As you can imagine, after a night flight and waiting for one hour at baggage reclaim everyone was very upset and angry. At this point there were no Rwandair representatives around for us to talk to, and we were all left to talk to Dnata, who shockingly told us that we need to wait for a phone call to say our bag has arrived, at least 24hours later, and that we will have to pick up our own bag, despite the fault being of the airline not ourselves.

I will add that the flight attendants were friendly, but I am currently left without my luggage, and knowing that I will have to pay large taxi fees to return to the airport to collect my luggage when it eventually arrives.

"The one hour flight from Nairobi to Entebbe in a Bombardier CRJ900 was as usual pleasant with the crew on board keen to please their passengers and did so with smiles. Food service in flight was commencing the moment the 'Fasten Seat Belt' signs went off and for the first time did I see the new snack boxes RwandAir is now using in Economy Class to serve a light lunch, in my case a chicken pastry and a slice of apple cake.
I am personally very happy that RwandAir has traffic rights between Uganda and Kenya as this airline offers a real quality option compared to the three or four other airlines on the route.
Some of those charge you even for a cup of tea and yet are their fares only marginally lower if not the same, so it is a no brainer with which airline I fly.

"I choose to fly RwandAir because they had the cheapest flights on the day that I wanted to travel. Also I had heard good things about them and I wanted to try them myself.
I took an early morning flight from Entebbe on a Bombardier plane and changed flights at Kigali. I went straight through security (which took a while but seemed efficient and thorough) onto the next flight. It was all very easy.
I flew midweek and the plane (an Airbus A330) was only half full, meaning I had several seats to myself. They were the comfiest plane seats I've ever sat on (and I was in economy). There was plenty of legroom. The plane seemed to be new and had an excellent entertainment system. I was going back to the UK to visit my family and really felt spoilt during my flight.
I was very impressed with all the staff. The captain took time to slowly walk down the aisles of the plane and greet each passenger individually. He did this before we took off from Entebbe. He did this again when we got to Kigali. The flight attendants were polite and very helpful. Nothing was too much to ask for.
The main flight took 8 hours and 20 minutes. I think managed to cram in 4 films.
The Rwandese are serious about developing tourism. The whole RwandAir experience was very professional. I also liked the Rwandese touches, such as the artwork in the cabin, the local butter served with meals, the in-flight magazine (which is very good) and the images of gorillas that appear on the entertainment screens.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/49/94/9b/charliebeau.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieBeau,Charlotte Beauvoisin Diary of a Muzungu wrote a review Aug 2018,Charlotte Beauvoisin Diary of a Muzungu,"Kampala, Uganda",463 contributions,123 helpful votes,Entebbe - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r602943529-RwandAir-World.html,A fantastic experience,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Over three occasions in the last eight months, flying Rwandair has become a nightmare. First earlier on this year I travelled to Entebbe, and found my luggage had not only been opened as there was a sticker on my toiletry bag from Rwandair confirming this, but my bag was damaged. They cut my bag to get to open my toiletry bag and I had to send it for repairs at my own cost as they were not keen on repairing my bag. Before that I found my suitcase with a huge cut on the outside which they repaired after 4 weeks and my bag is now so ugly as the repair workmanship was rushed. All this was reported to them via Twitter and I was exhausted with the follow up. The worst was the flight from NBO to HRE WB 110. After the flight was moved from 6:10am to 5:10am, we left for Kigali from NBO WB 465 and arrived at 6:50am after a stop over in Entebbe. This was not indicated when making the booking there was a stop over. The flight connecting to HRE was scheduled for 8:10 however at about 8:30am as usual no communication given we were informed by the notice board the flight had changed. After asking the officials they then said Operational Issue and the flight was to be delayed by 2 hours and at about 8:45 they announced it to to the passengers. Unbeknownst to us, we waited 3 hours for a flight from London to connect through Kigali. We were scheduled to arrive 11:00am and we arrived in HRE at 1:15pm. And after waiting another hour for our luggage we were informed the luggage is in KGL and will be sent the next day by an airport official. No communication from Rwandair on this or apology for the inconvenience to the passengers who will have to spend an extra night in HRE waiting for their luggage.  What is worse is they did not communicate this to us at all during the flight that there is no luggage. I am baffled why I waited 3 hours in KGL only for my luggage to not be put on the same flight to HRE. This is the last time I will use this flight as it seems the airline has bitten off more than they can chew. I have no luggage or communication on when or what time I will receive my bags tomorrow.

The served delicious food at midnight for such a short flight (2 hours). The flight was really smooth despite a stormy weather.

"Very affordable direct flight from Capetown to Harare and back.
As this is a new service I would expect in future to be able to book seats online in advance-a family of four(2 children) with none of the seats adjacent to each other is not acceptable, fortunately many others experienced the same problem so we arranged amongst ourselves to reseat.
Our flights (both CPT to HRE and vice versa) were delayed with no information given on the matrix boards to assist the people waiting for us on either end. Our shuttle service in Cape Town could not track the flight online and therefore had to arrive on time and wait for one hour which I paid extra for because it was the decent thing to do.
Particularly our flight from Harare 11:45 Friday 13/07/2018 - the matrix board at departures stated the flight was on time even though the aircraft docked late and we only started boarding about 45 minutes after the stated time.(at least on this flight the cabin crew apologized for the late departure unlike the CPT-HRE flight) I think all passengers understand that these things happen but would just like to be informed instead of watching the gate operators joking around and playing on their phones. I sensed general disapproval of this behaviour and if Rwandair wishes to continue with this service would suggest that they pay attention to what is going on at the airports that they service. It is all about the perception of the consumer. We accept logistical issues but not disrespect!
Having said this the aircrew performed impeccably and saved the day!

"I had to fly from Brussels to Entebbe on business. Turkish, Emirates, Brussels Airlines business class all upwards of Euro 2,300. A colleague of mine recommended Rwandair having just used them from Gatwick, via Brussels...  I bought a return Business Class ticket to Entebbe (via Kigali) for Euro 1,540. The plane was the most recent Airbus 330-300, seats were lie-flat beds, equal to any top class airlines. I had wine with my dinner (we left Brussels at 22.30pm). I was a little disappointed that the same type of red wine were served (2 x Merlot). I would suggest having one Merlot and one Cabernet Sauvignon. There was a choice of 3 meals including vegetarian, which were good.. Cheese platter or sweet dessert were also available. Friendly staff but they do need to be a little more attentive... (however the smiling flight attendants were most welcome!) The entertainment system was very modern but there selection was very limited 15-20 films. We landed early (8am.) in Kigali and were transported in a luxuriously upholstered leather bus. The terminal is small and very practical. The business lounge was a 10 seconds walk from the boarding pass transit control. The lounge also had a wide range of food available and great Cappuccinos! Transfer was just over one hour and the security check was prompt and fast. The connecting flight was 35 minutes long... All in all, excellent value for money! I would not shy away from trying Rwandair if flying to Central or Southern Africa. Their connections are very efficient.

"I will start by saying that Rwandair changed their fees for extra luggage for flights in the economy class flying from Nairobi, Kenya to Central Africa (Cameroon) from USD 46 to USD 150 for each extra 23 kg after your entitled luggage of 46 kg (2 pieces of 23 kg). They deliberately did not include the new price on the website and only inform clients when they arrive at the airport. The updated information on the website still includes the previous fees for extra luggage but the website now indicates as follows:
“The above rates apply to all East Africa routes except Nairobi. Please contact sales.nairobi@rwandair .com for the excess baggage rate for the route”
As such if you are travelling from Kenya to other states, the fees for extra luggage has been increased to more than three times the previous price.
Now let me tell you about the unprofessional, manipulative and retaliatory nature of Rwandair.
This may be long but bear with me and take some time to read this...you may learn a lesson or two and then decide if you want to still fly using Rwandair.
1. On 12 May 2018, my sister was traveling from Nairobi, Kenya to Cameron (Central Africa) on economy class with her son who was 1year 9 months. The flight was to leave at 5 am. She arrived at JKIA at 1am.
2. She had two suit cases of 23 kg each as her entitled luggage. She also had extra luggage. When she arrived at the airport, she was checked in by the staff of Kenyan Airways. For some reason Rwandair uses staff from Kenyan airways for check in. She was informed by the check in staff that she would be required to pay extra luggage USD 8 dollars per kg instead of USD 3 as indicated on the Rwandair website. She was also informed that the total amount of money she would pay for each of the two extra 20kgs of luggage was USD 620.
3. She explained to the ladies who were checking in, that according to Rwandair’s website she was required to pay USD 46 for each extra luggage of 23kgs for the route she was flying. The Kenya airways check in staff requested her to wait for the Rwandair staff to clarify further.
4. Around 3am, Rwandair staff at the JKIA office arrived. As a regular traveler on the same route, I noticed the staff always arrived two hours to an international flight! She had already been informed by the ladies checking in (who called her on the phone) that my sister had insisted on paying USD 46 as indicated on the Rwandair website. The Rwandair staff member informed my sister that the information on the website had changed and my sister was required to pay USD 8 dollars (and a total of USD 620) for extra luggage.
5. My sister called Rwandair office in Rwanda after talking to the JKIA staff who confirmed to her via telephone that extra luggage was USD 46 as indicated on the website. When she informed the JKIA staff of what Rwanda staff had confirmed, the JKIA staff showed her a document which was written ‘proposed fee for extra luggage for Rwandair’ and insisted payment had to be made on the basis of that document which had different fees from what was confirmed by Rwanda staff and indicated on Rwandair website.
6. When I asked Rwandair later to share a copy of this document with me, they informed me that it was an internal document and they were not required to share with clients.
7. My sister currently at terminal C, insisted that she was to pay USD 46; she was asked to go to Terminal 1D where she had checked in and talk to the sales officer. The sales officer agreed with my sister had to pay USD 46 but the reservation/check-in lady overruled him and insisted that my sister MUST pay as per the proposed fees.
8. Since my sister had not budgeted for the extra cost and had been kept moving around the airport with a small baby from 1am, I had to physically go the airport and pay the extra amount to enable her travel to avoid any further delays as it was already 4:15am and departure was 5am
9. At about 10am, I called Rwandair JKIA office to request for receipts for payment made for my sister. The sales officer issued and sent to me a receipt which he later nullified and sent another receipt with a different calculation for the payment made. When I requested for clarification as to the change in receipts, the sales officer clarified as follows;
“The total amount of excess luggage per KG is USD 8.00 and 1 Piece of 23KGs extra is USD 150.00. for an extra luggage of 2 pieces of 23kgs each which is USD 150.00*2 total USD 300.00 plus an extra 40 Kilos which we charged USD 8.00 per Kilo, total USD 8.00*40 total is USD 320.00. The total amount that was paid is USD 620.00.”
10. Later in the day, I escalated the issue to Rwanda office in writing and attachments which they replied to after ten (10) days. The Sales Manager Rwandair Kenya apologized for the issue and promised to have the issue resolved.
11. Subsequently, the Sales Manager contacted me to propose that my sister be upgraded to business for her next flight to Kenya. They did not tell me that they would not refund the extra money we had spent. When I informed that I would agree to an upgrade and a refund they told me they could only upgrade her flight and would not refund the money. On 28 May 2018, I informed Rwandair that we wanted a refund and not an upgrade. I also requested Rwandair to provide a calculation of the refund that they were to pay.
12. On 2 June 2018, the Sales Manager provided a calculation and requested whether the money could be redirected towards extra luggage on my sisters next trip. To which we informed them we wanted a refund as we had stated before.
13. Following the issue on 12th May 2018, my sister made two visits to Kenya without the refund being settled and having paid USD 46 for extra luggage on both visits.
14. On 26 June 2017, my sister travelled to Kenya from Cameroon and was due to return on 30 June 2018 still travelling through economy class. Again, she was at the airport at 1am and She informed me that she had called the Sales Manager and he informed her that a change had been made to the Rwandair website such that while the price for extra luggage from East Africa to Central Africa was still USD 46 the following wording had been included on the website:
“The above rates apply to all East Africa routes except Nairobi. Please contact sales.nairobi@rwandair .com for the excess baggage rate for the route”
She was informed at the airport that she needs to pay USD 150 for every 23kgs of extra luggage!
15. I called the Sales Manager at 3:30 am to request clarification as to what was happening. He informed me of the above disclaimer and I enquired why the rates were then not reflected on the website so that clients could be aware and prepared before going to the airport. He informed me that clients were to be informed of these changes once they arrived at the airport!!!! yes that’s what he said!!!!!!!!!
16. Since it had taken him more than two months to process the 12th May 2018 refund, I requested him to immediately settle the refund in order to pay for the extra luggage cost at the airport to allow my sister board her flight. He requested me to write to him requesting that the refund be used for extra luggage. Knowing that I had no other choice I wrote to him requesting him to use the refund towards the extra luggage. With this request, it was only then that he instructed the Rwandair staff at the airport to check in my sister.
17. Despite having complied to all Rwandair requirements, my sister arrived Cameroon without any of her luggage’s. They accepted payment for the luggage but still left behind her entire suitcases in Nairobi Kenya as she departed for Douala, Cameroon.
Clearly, Rwandair have successfully managed to ascertain their consistent unprofessionalism, manipulative and retaliatory ways irrespective of being a frequent flyer.

"I flew with RwadAir from Harare in April... The flight time is quite decent given that you sit in Brussels for an hour+ to drop/ pick passengers up.

This was the first time I used RwandAir and will definitely not be the last time. Their service is really good, the flight attendants are friendly and helpful. The food was alright can't compare it to Emirates though...

On the flight back to Harare, there were unaccompanied minors on the flight... I was pleasantly amused at how well the kids were entertained (dance competitions with the crew:) ) and looked after, even when they were being demanding the crew never once got annoyed.

All I can say is if RwandAir is one of your options choose it you will not regret it...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SShingaiii,SShingaiii wrote a review Jun 2018,SShingaiii,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",18 contributions,2 helpful votes,Harare - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r591122683-RwandAir-World.html,Great service,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had heard good things about Rwandair so decided to try them even though the flight time of 3am was daunting. It got off to a very bad start with an extremely slow and inefficient check-in process. Boarding was equally disorganized and the incoming flight delayed by an hour thus I missed the connection from Kigali to Abuja. Airport staff offered me an alternative to Nairobi to Addis to Abuja. I flatly refused. There were five of us who missed the connection and we were told they would have waited for us if we were ten. The staff were very polite and finally put us onto the flight to Lagos. We were met in Lagos by a very efficient manager but it was a mad rush to get onto a flight to Abuja without water or food being offered. We had been travelling for 14 hours by then. Finally arrived in Abuja and the airline offered to take me to my residence making me wait another 2 hours before we finally left the airport. Altogether disappointing and am uninspired to use them again. An 8 hour journey turned into 20 hours. I would have preferred to be given the option in Johannesburg not to take the flight and travel on another day since they already knew we could not make the connection.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/71/d9/02/travelwhiz58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelwhiz58,Anu P wrote a review Jun 2018,Anu P,"Johannesburg, South Africa",17 contributions,12 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Abuja,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r590646547-RwandAir-World.html,Disappointing service,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew with RwandAir to Dar we Salaam via Kigali. I found the aircraft to be clean and despite the short flights, we were offered hot food on all legs of the journey. The food wasn't great. It was similar to what was offered on major airlines decades ago. Once we landed in Kigali we were crammed into one bus like sardines to get to the terminal. I'm not sure if that is down to the airline or the airport. That aside, it was a fairly pleasant flight. Plenty of legroom and (apart from one) professional cabin crew. I had a choice of 2 airlines to use and flew RwandAir on the recommendation of someone.

"Recently had to make use of the airline for travelling from Entebbe via Kigali to Johannesburg. Cabin crew were friendly enough on both flights. Timing of the flights was poor. Ended up taking off late from Entebbe meaning that I ended up being ""rushed"" through security. This took 15 minutes as the officer decided that based on the fact that I had cigarettes with me it automatically means I must have a lighter, even though you can't enter Entebbe Airport with anything of the sort. Unpacked my entire carry on bag including my wallet. Not finding a lighter seemed to irritate him as he then decided to question me on carrying normal headache tablets. Eventually let through, ended up boarding last with no space in the overhead storage space. Emergency exit seat which meant my carry on ended up as checked luggage with my laptop in tow.

"If you are looking for a cheap flight to Dubai, this is your carrier, got a sweet deal for half the next airline price. Some people claim it is unreliable but I never had any problems (beginners luck maybe??!!). the shorter flights (Hre - Kigali) are in a smaller CRJ jet with no inflight entertainment so do carry a book. The Kigali to dubai stretch was on a bigger A320 jet and the inflight selection was very good.
I recommend staying away from any seat just in front of the emergency exits, they do not recline!!
Food was okay, but not emirate standards if you are picky about what you eat, a basic selection of either beef or chicken.

"This was a great flight, nice customer service, very fast and clean planes. Very friendly and great great service.

On my way back i misplaced my Watch in my bags and i felt so sad that my watch had been lost so i walked back to the entrance of the airport, i found a very friendly security/police officer along the way who told me not to walk back it was quiet a distance, they checked the place i was going and found out that actually the watch was not there the supervisor gave me this officer and we walked up to the baggage scanning area where the scanned all ma baggage and the found where i had misplaced my watch.

"Having arrived in Kigali at the end of a road trip, first to the Ugandan town of Kabale before proceeding to Kigali, my option was a one way ticket on RwandAir to fly back home.
With several flights a day there is really no issue to choose a suitable time and I opted for the early evening departure at 18.40 hrs local time.
I travelled in Economy class this time, the aircraft, a Bombardier CRJ900 offers a 2x2 configuration there as opposed to a 1x2 in Business class.
Boarding was called about 25 minutes early as apparently all passengers booked had checked in and we did indeed then leave about 15 minutes early as one passenger had obviously not paid attention to the boarding announcements.
The flight was quite full but in spite of that was the service prompt. I had some water, no tea on the short hop, but opted not to have the crisps offered - I still fancy the nuts RwandAir was serving on those short regional flights in the past.
Arrival in Entebbe was also way ahead of time with with no other flights being processed at that time was I through immigration, baggage check and the dreaded nonsensical baggage screening and on my way home.
Very good flight again, and RwandAir, business or economy, remains my airline of choice when travelling the region or to other African destinations!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review May 2018,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Kigali - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r578025455-RwandAir-World.html,35 minutes from Kigali to Entebbe ...

"I was flying from Nairobi to Kigali and on this route I could choose to fly with either Kenya Airways or RwandAir.  I was already flying on Kenya Airways on other sectors (check out the reviews HERE), and had heard a lot about RwandAir so wanted to try their product; so decided to book a flight with them.  On the route I was flying, there was no price difference between the two carriers so there was no real incentive to fly them other than time preferences and trying new airlines.  Booking the ticket was easy and quick on the RwandAir website, as it was very user friendly and efficient.  On the website, I was only able to book the flight and request a special meal, but I was not able to pre-select my seat.  I completed my booking and received the confirmation in email.I wanted to confirm the special meal request as well as request a seat assignment, so I emailed the airline.  The airline got back to me a couple of days later and said that my meal request had been confirmed but that they could not confirm seat assignments until the day of the flight.  My flight departed Nairobi at 3:35p and was scheduled to arrive into Kigali at 4pm (the flight had originated from Entebbe and was stopping off in Nairobi before heading to Kigali).  The day before my flight, I was able to check-in online and during this process I was able to preselect my seat and receive my boarding pass.  On the day of my flight, I was stuck in Nairobi traffic so I reached out to the airline via social media to see what would happen if I missed my flight (as RwandAir has an afternoon and evening flight departure).  To this day I still have not received a response from them, but luckily I made it to the airport in time.  RwandAir provides two checked bags for free, but I only had one bag so check-in was very easy and efficient; my luggage was tagged and I received my boarding pass.The operating aircraft for this flight was a CRJ aircraft, which generally are small and tiny.  The aircraft was parked on an aircraft stand so boarding passes were collected in the airport and then we walked to the aircraft.  The aircraft was laid out in a 2-2 seat layout and generally the seats were comfortable and the legroom was extremely good (I am tall and I had more than enough legroom).  Boarding a bit chaotic as there was no order to the process, with everyone trying to board at once and people having difficulty finding their seats.  The attendants on board were not particularly interested in helping any of the passengers nor in speeding up the boarding process.  Boarding finally completed, the door was closed, manual safety demonstrations were conducted, and we taxied to the runway.  This is another instance where the attendants were not really paying attention as the passenger sitting next to me did not understand the safety demonstrations, did not understand English, and was sitting without her seatbelt on.  I motioned twice for the flight attendants but they seemed least bothered.  It was only while doing their final safety checks did I repeat the information to the flight attendant and they finally paid attention. While the plane is taxing to the runway I was made to switch to a bulkhead seat – and even here most airlines make you put your hand-carry in the overhead compartment to keep the aisle clear.  On this flight, the attendants seemed least bothered.  After waiting for a while we finally took off for the 1hr 25m flight time. Once we reached cruising altitude, the inflight service commenced.  The attendants came by with a drink cart and a meal cart.  Even though I had ordered a special meal and the special meal was delivered onboard, it was not marked for a particular seat assignment nor with my name.  Another passenger, who had not pre-ordered a special meal but requested one onboard was given my special meal.  When I asked for the meal, they said they only had one and it had been given away so the option was to give me the regular tray of the sides without the main meal; I passed on that option.  When the drink cart came, it was limited as it only had juice, water, and alcohol.  I asked for a soft drink and they said they did not have it nor could they get it for me so I ended just taking water.  In both the drink and meal service, the attendants attitude was a ‘take it or leave it’; they couldn’t care less.  After the service concluded, there was not much to do for the remainder of the flight.  There were no PTV screens nor any inflight entertainment system.  The seats had compartment up top which held the airline magazine, the airsickness bag, as well as the duty free catalog.  There was also a tray table below and another holder beneath that to store other items.  There were no USB ports and I could not find any electrical outlets either.   We started our descent into Kigali and the attendants came by to do their last safety checks, and again they really did not pay attention to seatbacks being upright nor to ensure everyone had their seatbelts on.We landed into Kigali generally on time and taxied to a stand (there are no airline bridges at Kigali International) and deplaned via the stairs.  The stairs on the plane are very narrow and can be slippery, especially when it is raining as it was in Nairobi, and because of that three passengers slipped and fell coming down the stairs.  For this reason, the airline made the passengers go down the stairs very slowly so deplaning took a while.  After deplaning we boarded the bus which took us to the arrivals hall.Overall, I was disappointed with my RwandAir flight.  I was really looking forward to their flight, as I was told by others about their good service and I see how active they are on social media.  Despite my high expectations, everything the flight was a miss.  The customer service was lacking, the inflight service was poor, and the overall experience was lacking.  The only positives about the experience was the ease of booking the flight and the generous legroom.  Given this experience, I would not choose to fly RwandAir again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/ec/ef/5f/0504traveller.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0504Traveller,0504Traveller wrote a review May 2018,0504Traveller,"Kenner, Louisiana",4878 contributions,498 helpful votes,Nairobi - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r577361383-RwandAir-World.html,Poor Regional Flights,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After booking this flight in early March i was pleased to be getting a decent fair and connection to Gatwick...how wrong I was. When I booked the ticket there was no mention of any additional stopovers apart from Kigali which i was quite pleased and content with. Only the morning of the flight did I find out that, at the check in counter that the flight from Nairobi stops over in Entebbe first. We departed Nairobi and stopped over in Entebbe for 45 minutes without getting off the plane. After reaching Kigali I was then informed that there was to be an additional stopover in Brussels. Again after landing in Brussels we were on the plane for about 1 hour and 15 minutes and then proceeded to Gatwick. by now I was totally drained and tired and regretting trying to save and booking this flight. On the way back was the same route without the Entebbe stopover. However when we were in Brussels, we were on the plane for over 2 hours due to some paperwork glitch and couldn't take off. The seats were very uncomfortable for such a long trip and the food was below average. The entertainment was also minimal and not many choices The only minor plus point was the service from the on board staff which I cannot complain about. However I will never fly this airline again!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamKassam,SamKassam wrote a review Apr 2018,SamKassam,"Nairobi, Kenya",6 contributions,7 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r575972526-RwandAir-World.html,Beware when booking!!!,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The night time flight from Johannesburg to Kigali allowed for some snooze time on board. Covered with a warm blanket and the seat reclined to the max - footrest fully extended for added comfort - did I manage to sleep until the crew woke me up in time for breakfast. As the pictures show, a good variety, omelette included, a great way to wake up on board of a flight with a cup of tea served as a 'starter'.
The crew, having already flown the Kigali to Johannesburg sector, remained fresh and alert and SMILING throughout the flight, not once giving the impression they had already been on duty for close to 10 hours when landing in Kigali.
I had a connecting flight home to Entebbe and that is when it got interesting. We left on time on a CRJ900 and the short hop to Entebbe was extended when very bad weather greeted us just minutes before landing. Safety first, the captain decided to go around and not land on first attempt and when landing showed excellent skills to keep the aircraft stable during heavy cross winds just before touchdown. My compliments to the cockpit crew for this bit of superb flying!
The cabin crew was very switched on and made sure seat belts were tight before landing, probably aware of the adverse weather conditions.
I was served a cup of tea, freshly made, but if one word of constructive critique can be voiced, I preferred the nuts offerings to the crisps. Otherwise, two excellent flights on my return from South Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Apr 2018,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Entebbe,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r575521539-RwandAir-World.html,Flights three and four of this journey - free of any problems!,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I will split my reviews into two sections, for two flights each, from Entebbe via Kigali to Johannesburg and then the return flights a few days later.
My outbound service from Entebbe to Kigali was running slightly late and I was a bit worried about my connection, not so much for myself but for my checked suitcase.
No problem at all, it turned out. Off the plane in Kigali, parked right in front of the terminal, were several RwandAir staff members at hand to fast track Johannesburg bound connecting passengers through the transit reporting point to the mandatory security check and straight on to the boarding gate.
A dedicated business class passenger bus was at the ready to take myself and several more passengers to the aircraft. I asked on boarding to please let me know if my baggage has made the connection too and was, before doors were closed, assured that my baggage was on board.
I have never transited so fast through Kigali for an onward connection and full credit to the airline to stay on top of short connections and facilitating passengers in such an exemplary manner.
The service was operated with a B737-800 and the cabin was clean, the crew on board warmly welcoming and besides proffering drinks before take off were earphones, a blanket and a vanity kit distributed, with a smile! Hot towels too were offered, thankfully accepted to wipe the sweat off my face.
After reaching cruising altitude was dinner served and as the pictures show, a very presentable and tasty meal - my main course being a succulent chicken breast.
The three and a half hours passed quickly while I did some work, the sockets in the seat keeping my laptop powered up and recharging my tablet enroute to Johannesburg. Tea was served by the attentive crew throughout and my cup never stayed empty for more than a minute.
RwandAir once again proved their mettle and remains, for me flying out of Entebbe, the fastest way to get to South Africa. I was traveling on to Cape Town, a destination RwandAir will add in May and I wished my conference had taken place a month later but there will always be an opportunity in the future to fly Kigali Harare Cape Town and sample Rwandan hospitality again in the skies and on the ground.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Apr 2018,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Entebbe - Johannesburg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r575519960-RwandAir-World.html,"Great service, on the ground and in the air ...",Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew bushiness class on both legs with my 4 year old. The cabins were clean but everything else was average or below average. The wifi advised is only for 15mins and there after its about $30 for 500mb. We had a stop over in Brussels that was supposed to be 50 mins and 2 hours later we were still to depart, i had to beg the cabin crew to give us food because it was almost 11pm and having departed Gatwick at 7 we were the children on-board were obviously hungry. The on-board entertainment is very very limited and to make it worse it was the same on the return flight so we didn't even bother switching the screens on. The food is not business class standards at all but as a new airline perhaps they are still trying to find their feet. The starter and main on the outboard leg was exactly the same as the inboard so nothing exciting there. The drinks are served of the large bottles both soft and alcoholic so the fizzy drinks turn to be flat and as the alcoholic i returned the glass i ordered of Amarula its just didnt taste right like it had been watered down or something (Perhaps left open too long) on our return leg we had another 2 hour delay on ground in Brussels and the ice malted so ordering a drink meant you get a flat warm drink. The cabin crew in business class did try their best to be attentive with limited resources. The connection in Kigali is very smooth speaking for business class passenger, a luxury bus collected us from the aircart reserved for business class passengers only and we were whisked through to the business class lounge which is very clean and most basics available. They have a play area for kids in the lounge to keep our little ones busy. We were collected from the lounge and assisted through security and to the connecting flight with no delay. On getting to Harare our 6 bags did not arrive, although this is something i was expecting as i had been warned by other passengers but its the lack of information that aggravated us most. Apparently from Kigali to Harare is a smaller aircraft so bags as left in Kigali to be transported on the next flight, this is totally understandable but if we were informed on arrival we could have saved ourselves 3 hours roaming aimlessly around the airport. Our bags did finally arrive the next day and im not sure if they had been left outside in the rain overnight but out belongings were soaking wet, i was so exhausted i did not even have the energy to ask for compensation. Overall considering the fare i paid i will class my experience as ok, had i paid more then the score would be lower as they say you get what you pay for. Would i fly Rwandair again YES (Because of the cheap fare) but this time i will be more prepared and will not expect much.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniquemN1320PR,Monique M wrote a review Apr 2018,Monique M,,3 contributions,,London - Harare,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r573921810-RwandAir-World.html,Average Flight,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"For some reason everyone we told about flying Rwandair were shocked. In reality the flight out to Kigali was ok as was the remainder to Harare and the experience was very much similar to Ethiopian Airlines etc. Fairly basic but ok in the long run. Coming back from Harare however was not as good as we stopped at Brussels from Kigali. Supposedly for 50 minutes to refuel. We were there for about an hour and three quarters as the plane had lost the paperwork in order to leave the airport. This meant arriving late at Gatwick and we were worried about getting our booked taxi back to our house in Bedfordshire. We did but it put a bit of a dampner to the end of a very long journey. If you want a budget airline then this is ok. Plane was clean,food was standard, stewards were very helpful but when the captain says that you will be leaving in five minutes but 20 minutes later you are still there, well that's what budget airlines are about.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwe222019,Ian Duncan wrote a review Apr 2018,Ian Duncan,"Bedfordshire, United Kingdom",51 contributions,9 helpful votes,London - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r573613377-RwandAir-World.html,Average flight,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was served by someone at the Entebbe airport when checking in my luggage. I had two luggages one was overweight and one was underweight, I had asked the lady if they could balance it or at least reduce something. I choose this airline because of their higher baggage allowance but unfortunately I had a small suitcase that couldn't reach 23kg. She would not allow me to distribute the excess weight of the large suitcase onto the small one even though her coworkers were telling her she could do that. Although I understand they don't have to balance out the weight it was frustrating to hear that she could have if she was just willing to. The worst part was when she charged for my overweight bag. She kept claiming it was 7kgs over when it was only 6kgs. She finally agreed and I paid. At the time I was really frustrated and she had told me to go through security then I would get my receipt and change. When I got it I realized she charged by the 7kgs instead of the 6kgs. I saw her after and confronted her about this and said she was taking advantage of me and she said she wasn't because it's on the receipt. She had no regret or sympathy. I don't know why she would even want to overcharge me. The rest of the flight was good but she really ruined the experience for me. I am discouraged from using this airline again if I don't have to.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer321864,reviewer321864 wrote a review Apr 2018,reviewer321864,"Moshi, Tanzania",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Entebbe - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r572266139-RwandAir-World.html,Poor Customer Service,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Booked a great flight from Libreville to Nairobi and while everything ran smoothly to Cameroon, things quickly turned into a nightmare. As soon as we boarded our already late flight in Doula, we were headed for alot of bad news. At Doula an airline steward asked us why we booked our layover for so long in Kigali... “What do you mean?” I asked and explained that when you book online you have no control over layovers. This friendly guy understood and advised that at Kigali we should inform the first steward we met about this issue. Apparently when we landed at Kigali they had a flight at midnight and was stunned that we didn’t book this flight. We were even more stunned that they were stunned and even more so that they insisted that it was somehow our fault. My baby daughter was more irritable and just wanted a nap. They refused to pay for the transit hotel and insisted we sleepover in the airport lobby. So many other airlines go through this same sort of issue and we were shocked to find them unprepared to offer this.

"I was unsure what to expect for such a budget price, but what I got was a fast, reliable, comfortable journey for about half the price of some of the other airlines!

The check-in was simple and friendly with no problem about my one piece of hand luggage (unlike other airlines who can be truly pedantic about weight limits). The plane for the Gatwick - Kigali leg was a modern Airbus A330 complete with on-board WiFi (15 mins free per leg) and individual screens with a selection of films. The choice isn't vast, but I got to see the award-winning 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' on the way home which I was very happy about (great film by the way).

The Kigagli - Harare leg used a Boeing 777 which was OK - no individual screens but for 2½ hours this was no problem.

At all times on all legs the planes were spotlessly clean and with low load factors there was plenty of space for everyone to stretch out. The food was excellent and plentiful and although there are no free spirits available there is a choice of wine and beers.

I guess the proof of the pudding is that I would have no hesitation flying with RwandAir in the future - a decision I would base not just on their low prices but also the first class quality of their service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2989UXjerryb,Jerry B wrote a review Mar 2018,Jerry B,"Dornoch, United Kingdom",8 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r568468848-RwandAir-World.html,Excellent service - no hesitation in going again!,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was pleasantly surprised when I recently traveled with Rwandair from London to Nairobi. I wasn't expecting much as I haven't heard a great deal about the airline before but everything went well.

Staff at both check in counters were friendly and polite, the in flight stewards were always happy to help, professional with a smile on their face.

The food was not great, but satisfactory for a flight and enough provided so that you never felt hungry throughout the flight. Choice of soft drinks and juice was decent, but the wine was pretty bad.

Entertainment had good variety and fairly up to date, but not a massive amount of TV and films to choose from.

The flights weren't too busy which meant I could stretch out and sleep, a huge bonus especially when provided with a clean blanket.

One issue was they do not notify you of stop over in Brussels, sat on the tarmac for approx 1 hour and the entertainment system goes off is not ideal.

"Will keep this short. During the first week of March 2018, I boarded a RwandAir flight from Entebbe back to Nairobi with a short layover in Kigali, two hours fifteen minutes or so. Some where along the way my luggage was left out in the rain, I don't know where or for how long but when I got it in Nairobi it and everything inside was wet (wet enough to get my clothes bleeding and make ink wash off) plus some tears here and there. It took me a minute to recognize it on the baggage carousel. Everything not dark-colored was in different shades and colors from clothes to papers. I had to suffer the loss of all reading and writing materials discarded before perusal and preparation of necessary reports. This was a business trip and I was dumb enough to place all expense bills in the suitcase, I've been able to get some from different parties involved but I'm afraid some necessary refunds will not be made without proof, I have only my story. Two, I also have to bear the cost of replacing clothes and two gadgets. Now let's move to their customer care service, wow! how can an entire department be so incompetent?

"I was traveling in business class and I stupidly forgot my phone on the aircraft. I left it exactly on my seat, inside the beauty kit that the crew provided us with for traveling in business. I realized my phone’s loss after one hour and 15 minutes, so I immediately called rwandair while heading back to the airport. They told me they would have sent somebody to check. I spent two hours at the airport, no one was able to understand the import info that my phone was just inside the kit and I don’t know if they simply were not able to understand (which is a problem if you work in an airport), or if they just didn’t want to. I spoke with many people from the security, I sent an  email as they suggested me to do even If I was there in person, standing in front of them. I made calls, trying to find more competent people than the ones there...and after two hours their answer was always “they’re still looking”. Of course, how much time do you need to check on a single sit, inside a kit??! At the end they told me they couldn’t find it, and since my phone was 100% there , and since after me no one beside the rwandair staff have had access to the business class area, they admitted that for sure somebody of the cleaners had found my phone and kept it. I came back to the airport two times after that they, both times for hours, blaming them to have stolen my phone and no one was able to help me. I just received answers as “ok, I’m going to ask”/ “I’m going to investigate on the cleaning staff”...nothing more. It’s incredible that they were not able to find the person of their own staff that stole my phone...they just didn’t care! And because of them I lost a phone of the value of 850 € (900,000 FRW) and no one is going to pay for that. Of course I was the one forgetting the phone, but from a flag’s carrier you expect for sure a more responsible behavior. Furthermore, after shearing this story with some people, I discovered that it was not the first time that something got stolen on their aircraft by the staff. iPads, sunglasses, expensive watches...everything magically disappears when forgot in their flights. I won’t never fly again with them, I spent so much money flying in business and this is how they pay their costumers back.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eledettori,Eleonora wrote a review Feb 2018,Eleonora,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",20 contributions,19 helpful votes,Dubai - Kigali,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r562778023-RwandAir-World.html,Dishonest people!

"I flew with RwandAir back to Dubai and the aircraft was a reasonably new A330 that provided comfortable and seats in Economy - with reasonable space.  They have a in-flight entertainment system (you apparently have to use your own earphones and their sockets use the normal one-pin earphone sockets that is used for normal mobile phone earphones - that was therefore not an issue for me (I am not sure if they would provide earphones if you ask for them).  They also had in-flight wifi as an option (I did not use this as it was a night flight) and the choice of movies, although limited compare to say Emirates, were good enough for me to find an interesting title.

"Our expectations were high given the experiences of others about their flights on Rwandair within the region and despite a friend of ours having taken the same flight a week earlier and arrived without their luggage in the midst of a cold snap.

Things didn't get off to a terific start when our flight from Entebbe to Kigali left half an hour late but the plane was new and the seats comfortable which is all you can hope for on a forty 40 minute Flight.

Our next leg from Kigali to Brussells was a further hour late in departing with the Captain explaining that this was due to the plane arriving late from its previous flight. This explanation is always bemusing given that it is one airline.

Again the best thing that could be said was that the cabin was in very good condition and not surprisingly so given the plane is less than a year old. The business section was not very full so we expected lots of attention from the cabin crew but this was not be the case.

We had ordered a vegtarian meal and were served up what was clearly lunch for breakfast. I suggested as much to the steward but he was insistent. For some reason hash browns with grilled mushrooms and baked beans were not considered suitable for a vegatrian breakfast but fried bananas and chickpeas were. At lunch we were served the same sauce with rice confirming that we were indeed served the lunch offering for breakfast.

Unlike the normal business class where staff are almost pestering to serve you drinks and snacks this was not to be on this particular flight. When I asked for water at one stage the steward seemed to remember he should have been serving the passengers and clutched several bottles and went through the cabin offering water to everyone. The sleep quality was good given the flat bed fold out of the seat.

The on board entertainment system is sparsely populated if one is being kind, if you are able to carry your own content do so. The inflight wifi did not work on the outward leg of the journey whilst on the return leg it did work albeit for 15 minutes whereupon you could purchase a limited bundle that was also time limited.

Our return flight also left nearly an hour and a half late, again for the same reason that our initial flight was late, someone keeps taking these planes for a joyride it would seem.
The cabin was once again sparsely populated and the meal service more in line with the offerings in economy which was packed. We were even served a meaty salad with our vegetarian meal which is always a nice touch.

Our return flight was topped off with the discovery that our luggage did not return with us. Thankfully it all came in intact albeit a day late and was delivered to our door.

One would struggle to find a business class ticket to the UK from Equatorial Africa at a price that is no more than 50% over economy on most of the other airlines and that is perhaps the best thing that can be said of this airline. In all other aspects they are very much still finding their feet with their marketing department clearly doing a much better job than their training, customer care and ground handling departments. If all you need is the extra legroom, a flatbed seat, and use of a lounge at the airport plus some queue jumping then for the price this is the airline for you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lumumbaw,lumumba w wrote a review Feb 2018,lumumba w,"Sutton, United Kingdom",58 contributions,8 helpful votes,Entebbe - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r557854505-RwandAir-World.html,Still finding their feet,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Took 3 flights with RwanAir. The short economy flight fro Entebbe to Kigali was excellent in every respect. A new plane, superb staff and a small snack all in 40minutes.

The Business flight from Kigali to Jo’berg was variable, the Business lounge needs to ensure its food is hot, only saw the microwave after, staff here could be more cheerful. Check in staff could have allocated us a better seat, there were plenty of spare but one person already in a double space.

"I have flown this route thousands of times but this was my first with this airline, chosen for it's very reasonable prices.  Top marks for that Rwandair.  The planes were really clean and well kept and the cabin crew the same.  Top marks Rwandair.  Unfortunately the crew on our trip out were rather automated with no charm or customer service.  They were performing a duty and didn't look that happy about it either.  Never mind, we got there in one piece, fed and watered relatively adequately, but having endured the worst flight I have ever encountered on account of the incessantly screaming babies both directly in front and behind.  Not your fault Rwandair, however you could have asked the parents if they needed anything for their babies like putting the economy lights out earlier to encourage sleep (Business Class were allocated a dark environment earlier but perhaps they had to pay extra for that).  Then we arrived but our luggage didn't.  We waited 24 hours for it and had to pay a taxi to go and collect it the next day.  It was a good thing we were staying in Nairobi because if we were off anywhere on a safari, we would have had no clothes and no Christmas presents. I'm still waiting for Rwandair to get back to me about refunding me the 3,000KSH for the taxi fare.  I have had responses but completely off-subject and now I am being ignored.  I am not a difficult person, just want back what is due please.The journey back was done in leapfrog flights.  I don't mind roughing it a bit so the 15 hours total flying time was OK if a little tiring.  The Kenyan crew that took us as far as Rwanda were lovely - smiley, chatty and helpful.  Then the automated ones got on to take us to the UK.  Our pilot needed a few more practices at landing - we seemed to thud each time but again we did land, got all our baggage this time (thanks to the Kenya Airways ground stewardess who made sure each one had PRIORITY on it this time) and that was that.  I understand from the ground crew in Nairobi that left luggage at either Brussels or Rwanda is a daily occurrence so I would recommend that Rwandair get their act together on this.  I cannot believe that they are not receiving claims every day and also angry passengers who were not so fortunate as ourselves.  Still waiting for my 3,000KSH please Rwandair.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobplus2,cobplus2 wrote a review Jan 2018,cobplus2,"Winchester, Virginia",4 contributions,6 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r553156750-RwandAir-World.html,Lost luggage still waiting for reimbursement,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Booked with Rwandair after reading some good reviews and and the ticket prices being considerably less than the major airlines with only one short stop in Kigali shown at the time of booking. Next time I will pay more to fly with a different airline, on the way from London to Johannesburg the flight proceeded to stop in Brussels, Kigali, Lusaka and finally Johannesburg with a delay in Kigali and additional time added to the journey from all the stops. This caused a missed connecting flight once in Johannesburg of which Rwandair office in JHB wanted to know nothing about. In addition to this online check in allows you to pick your seats only for them to be changed once boarding passes are sent through. I found the planes to be in good order being new and the on board staff to be pleasant, however there is little to be said about the ground staff/customer service working for Rwandair, at the counters and well as over the phone. trying to call the head office in Kigali and office is JHB  the phone just rings out.

"All the flights we had were delayed staff were very unfriendly and had a very nonchalant attitude and did not seem to concerned about the fact that the delays may cause us missing connecting flights. Once in Kigali the security checks are pathetically slow with two machines operating for checking bags this process to go through the security took over an hour going to London and returning to JHB. On the way to London we were informed there would be a stop in Brussels, the first we heard of this was once we boarded the flight. On the way back to JHB we stopped in Brussels and to our surprise there was a stop in Lusaka after leaving Kigali. Again with no prior knowledge. We specifically booked the flight because because it was a one stop with short layovers had we known about all the stops we would have booked another flight. The aircraft was clean and tidy however the on board entertainment was very limited. There was also no control over the amount of hand luggage this also caused delays with cabin crew trying to find place for passengers luggage.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rorye358,rorye358 wrote a review Jan 2018,rorye358,,2 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r550792655-RwandAir-World.html,Delays on all flights,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I got tickets way in advance! And checked in on time. When i checked in i chose my seats at the front however when the boarding passes were sent the seat numbers change and my wife was seating behind me which was odd. When i got to the airport the seat also changed and they still allocated seats apart from each other. So I brought it to their attention and they changed the seats and we sat together. The flight went via Brussels and when  we got there to my surprise other passengers where allocated the same seats and were asked to move which I was not happy about. I moved non the less and that meant my seat allocation changed 3 times. This happened to most people on the flight. I will never go on their airline again and  unfortunately I have to endure a return journey with them.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16jeffreym,Jeffrey M wrote a review Dec 2017,Jeffrey M,,16 contributions,12 helpful votes,London - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r548457647-RwandAir-World.html,Terrible ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked my flight nine months prior to departure based on the flight being advertised as one stop taking 13hrs 25min. I received notification of a minor itinerary change of a slightly earlier departure time which was not a problem. A week prior to departure I reviewed the detailed itinerary to discover that the flight had changed to three stops adding 4 hours 20min to my journey which impacted my onward flight to Durban. As a result I was forced to cancel my flights and book alternatives last minute costing me almost £2,500 extra. I was not informed of the change or offered any compensation as this is deemed to be a minor flight change by the airline.

"For a country that has come a long way to restore it's economy and to heal the wounds of the hutsi and tutsi civil war, RwandAir has 100% really tried. I would recommend for any one with a lower budget. I enjoyed the food and the drinks. Friendly male hosts who catered for all our needs with smiley faces. Unfortunately no TV's for individuals but about 10+ or less tvs with one channel for all passengers. Little space for legs and less comfort for a long flight.

"About two weeks ago I had my first RwandAir flight. Since it was my first, I am not sure how to rate this one. This is why, checking in at O R Tambo International (in Johannesburg) went smoothly. The in-flight service was great as the cabin crew was friendly which, I appreciated. However, my landing in Kigali was not as great. After going through passport control, I got to the carousel to collect my luggage and noticed that my luggage is not there. I eventually went to the luggage office to enquire about this. After checking on the system (as he put it), the very serious guy who assisted me said that my luggage is still in Johannesburg and it was never loaded onto the flight. Now at this moment, there was no point in getting angry because my luggage was not going to magically appear but what brought on my indifference was that when I asked him if they would deliver my luggage to the hotel (since I am in a foreign country), he noted that it is not possible at all. Hence, I am not sure how to rate this airline. First impression is lasting impression after all but then again, the in flight service was great. At this moment, if I don't use the airline in the near future it wouldn't be a complete  train smash but not completely apposed to using it again (at some point)...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalGradwell,CrystalGradwell wrote a review Dec 2017,CrystalGradwell,"Pretoria, South Africa",7 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r544916475-RwandAir-World.html,Uncertain of rating...,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"These were flights seven and eight in the space of three weeks with RwandAir and once again did the airline live up to expectations.
I managed to wait for boarding at the airline's lounge in Lagos after a problem free check in and going through immigration and security.
The ground handling staff, after carrying out a final body and hand baggage check at the gate, then boarded business class passengers first, followed by Premium Economy passengers - RwandAir has no doubt the best such option in the African skies with extra legroom, wider seats and deep recline before boarding economy class passengers.
Once on board, business class was more than three quarters full, did the crew do their thing with taking one's jacket for hanging up in a wardrobe cabinet, offered a choice of drinks and topped it with steaming hot towels to wipe the sweat off one's face.
The food and drink service, after reaching cruising level, was swift and the smoked salmon starter was fresh and tasted good. More buns, and butter, was offered when the main course was served, then followed by a plate of select cheeses and rounded up by an offering of dessert.
If I had to add anything it would be offering a printed menu to passengers to be aware of the meal choices before the service which would be the icing on the cake no doubt for many passengers.
Upon landing was my jacket returned immediately without having to ask for it.
The aircraft was parked close to the arrival building, no need for a bus and within a few steps was I inside the building, reached the transfer desk and had my onward boarding pass from Kigali to Entebbe stamped.
Transit was 'rapid', only a short queue at the Business Class / VIP security lane - this puts Entebbe airport to shame where no such facilities exist - and I boarded my last sector flight home which took just over half an hour from take off to landing. Connecting with RwandAir to West Africa and to Southern Africa clearly is the fastest option for a passenger from Uganda and I have no hesitation to book WB again for future flights to these parts of Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Nov 2017,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Lagos - Entebbe,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r544333282-RwandAir-World.html,"The fastest connection from Lagos to Entebbe, via Kigali",Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was my 6th flight with RwandAir in the space of just 14 days and again I did not regret my choice of airline as I was flying from Entebbe via Kigali to Lagos.
Not only is this the fastest possible connection between Uganda and Nigeria but also the most comfortable.
The 1x2x1 configured business class section offers excellent comfort levels and the state of the art flatbed seats leave nothing to be desired - in fact a massage function is an added extra many other airlines do not provide.
I spent my connecting time, just over an hour between flights, in the Pearl Lounge at Kigali International Airport and, when called for boarding, used the separate security channel for business class passengers. Same procedures of course but notably a notch friendlier and certainly no queues to get to the boarding gate. The plane was parked nearby and I was able to walk to the stairs and a ground staff again fast tracked my boarding when seeing my C-class boarding pass.
When entering the plane I was warmly greeted and told by a cabin crew member that I was free to move to a window seat of my choice as the load on the day was light upfront.
Captain Cobbina Kojo even greeted me - other passengers too - before he returned to the cockpit to complete his preflight checks.
Purserette Laetitia Umuzayire and her colleague Edwige Munezero were as keen as cabin crew ever come, a delight to be served by them.
On the flight to Lagos was a full breakfast offered, with a choice of buns and/or pastries, freshly cut fruits - no seeds at all in the water melon slices!!! - and then followed by an omelette with baked beans and notably roasted gonja, a type of sweet banana, adding local flavour to the morning meal. I was even asked if I'd wanted some more food but politely declined.
I had mentioned to Miss Laetitia that I would like my tea cup to be refilled ever so often and she did exactly that while I concentrated to first scan through the entertainment channels before deciding to read a book I brought. Time flew by and the four hour flight was over in no time.
A warm good bye and hope to see you again, delivered by both front cabin crew, made for a very pleasant exit.

"A few days after flying with RwandAir from Entebbe to Lusaka, via Kigali, did my return journey turn out to be even better.
Exhausted from a tight conference and visiting programme, no sooner were the 'Fasten Seat Belt' signs off, did I use the full recline, foot rests out and was fast asleep. When I woke about an hour into the flight was the crew led by purser Robert Rwigema prompt at hand and offered me my dinner and then served me tea. I appreciated the courtesy to let me sleep rather, as regularly experienced elsewhere, wake me because it was time to eat! I surely appreciated that thoughtfulness.
Upon landing in Kigali I had the opportunity to sample the new business class bus which really added a new service dimension for RwandAir on the ground. Refreshing to see that what has been asked of other airlines in Africa by premium passengers was implemented first by RwandAir, taking the lead again and shaming other, older and more established airlines which habitually talk but rarely act.
The wait for my final leg from Kigali to Entebbe was spent in the Pearl Lounge and a RwandAir ground staff called me as the flight was boarding. A separate security channel for business class passengers saw me literally walk through the check, no queues, and directly on to the waiting bus.
The CRJ900 on this service took only 35 minutes to Entebbe but gave the crew enough time to serve me tea.

"I traveled on my first sector from Entebbe to Kigali. The flight left slightly early after all passengers were on board. The crew, despite the early hour - take off was set for 06.30 a.m. - was cheerful and prompt with both Purser Nsoro Aine and his colleague Ange Inkindi really 'fussing' over their passengers. The flight is just over half an hour but I got my tea and a refill, what more can one wish for.
Transit in Kigali is one of short ways and then, depending on the connection time, either spending some time in the lounge or else proceeding through security and waiting for the flight to be called for boarding.
Due to the murky situation in Zimbabwe on the day was the original Lusaka - Harare service 'merged' with Johannesburg and Harare got cancelled.
A bus transfer from the terminal to the aircraft spares one the walk and just like on my first leg flight, when on board the crew immediately swung into action.
Purser Venest Musoni and his colleagues served me a hot breakfast after reaching cruising altitude, had my tea cup refilled at all times and were utterly professional with a permanent smile.

"We could not check in on line for some reason, no preselect seats. Airport check is a bit like Air Zimbabwe in the old days, friendly, helpful but slightly chaotic. Lounge at Gatwick absolutely fine for a non-legacy African carrier. Aircraft clean with good choice of seats available as only 6 pax in J-Class. Try to get 2H or 4H as these are sheltered from the aisle as are a number of others which is more peaceful. The premium economy cabin was empty. No water bottle in the seat pockets however no shortage of drinks on request including pleasant NV champagne. No menu's provided however starter of unknown origin was tasty and a main offering of chicken or beef followed by a desert or cheese was very adequate. Lie flat seat is Vantage XL and super comfy. Entertainment was limited but at least the system worked. Headsets were okay. Breakfast was hot, fresh and very good. Washrooms on board very clean but missing hings such as drinking water cups and wet wipes.Transit in Kigali still focused on security and irrespective of class of travel if you are in transit you are manhandled through the system without any mention that the Business Lounge and washroom facilities are before the security check. Rwandair need to get on top of that especially where business passengers are concerned. Connecting flight to Harare was switched from CRJ to B737-800 - no complaints as 2:2 seating in business. Attentive service including light meal and snacks. A brief well managed stop in Lusaka and only real disappointment was lack of Rwandair staff in the arrivals lounge nor priority luggage delivery for Business class.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Capt_Coleman_M,Coleman M wrote a review Oct 2017,Coleman M,"Harare, Zimbabwe",70 contributions,41 helpful votes,London - Harare,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r532920175-RwandAir-World.html,Very good for a national carrier in Africa,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This was our first time with Rwandair and it was faultless. The plane was a brand new Bombardier CRJ 900. We were given the emergency exit seats which was a bonus. The cabin crew were all helpful and polite and even on the very short flight managed to get round with a snack and drink. No entertainment on the flight but not missed on such a short flight.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0Pete_23,Peter R wrote a review Oct 2017,Peter R,"Dartford, United Kingdom",1043 contributions,376 helpful votes,Kigali - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r531373540-RwandAir-World.html,Good Experience,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One doesnt fly Rwandair daily but when I looked for cheap tickets to Rwanda, this was by far the cheapest. How does cheap compare with service, I worried and booked it after a little bit of research...

"Have used RwandAir for a couple of years now. Loved the fact that they kept to time. Sadly this key thing for good service expected from an airline has for the past year been nonexistent. The final straw for me was on the 3rd of August. Flight was planned to depart from OR Tambo at 2h55AM, arrive at 6h45am in Kigali and the Rwandair ticket office than booked my connecting flight to leave at 7h30am. The flight at OR Tambo left an hour and around 30 mins late. So ofcourse I missed my connecting flight. Good customer service would expect that Rwandair would try find a solution to ensure that the customer is comfortable and gets the quickest connecting flight due to their fault. But no I was told I could not get a flight that was leaving around 8h00 (even though offered to pay difference) as it was too late to embark, but yet for a full hour after my arrival at Kigali the attendants were searching for missing passengers. Secondly we were than left to sit till 16h30 waiting for connecting flight instead of offered somewhere to rest.

A complaint was done to Rwandair which they acknowledged receipt and gave the general polite responses but that was it. Rather go for Kenya Airways going forward",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/05/2d/db/ariane-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arianeb220,Ariane B wrote a review Aug 2017,Ariane B,"Bujumbura Mairie Province, Burundi",11 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Bujumbura,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r518776504-RwandAir-World.html,Final time traveling on it,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I would like to start by commending the airline for keeping time and for the clean aircrafts. Keep it up. They need to look into the uniform and training of their crew though. The uniform is soo dull and the finishing quite poor. We checked in online for the 4 flights we were taking with my family and on two instances they changed our seats without notice to us. After suffering the inconvenience the first time, we made sure to check our next boarding tickets and we noted that the seats we had booked were different from those we were given at physical check-in. We asked why and the explanation is that they had changed the type of the aircraft we'll be traveling in and so the seating arrangement we used to check-in online was invalid. The courteous thing however would have been to notify us when we presented our printed boarding passes and show us the available seats for us to select. Instead, they just selected other seats (nowhere near where we had earlier selected) and gave us the tickets.
We also had a very bad experience in one of the flights where our baby started nosebleeding. We asked for help from one of the cabin crew. We waited for about 5 minutes and when he did not show up, i went to find out what had happened only to find him comfortably seated down. When i complained, he told me that he thought i had gone to use the toilet at the rear. Why he made that assumption i don't know as my problem was not accessing the toilet. We needed help to stop the bleeding which had been going on for almost 10minutes. Though another cabin crew heard me complaining and came to assist us, i'm still very disappointed that a member of the cabin crew would be asked for help in a matter especially involving a toddler and comfortably go back to his seat without any concern for the distress of the parent and the child.

There wasn't much traffic at Entebbe airport and check in was smooth as was boarding, well ahead of time after all passengers had checked in already. Hence we left Entebbe ahead of time too.

"I cannot recommend the service highly enough - I had an amazing journey both to and from JNB.  It's a long flight and something that you settle yourself to endure rather than enjoy.  Staff were wonderful - giving parents of little children a break by occupying the little ones with soft toys - giving one lady who was concerned about swelling ankles a foot rub.... a foot rub!!! can you imagine any other airline giving this kind of care! Cabin crew were so keen to promote their lovely country and clearly thrilled to be given the freedom to offer top end customer service. (I read in the magazine that this was a 'thing'...it works).  Food was of a very high standard - particularly from LGW - eg. broccoli was actually green rather than the usual grey.  Kigali is basic but functional as a stop over and things there seem professional and efficient.  I paid a very tiny amount for this flight but would be prepared to pay considerably more in future if this level of service is maintained.  I've flown to JNB by every conceivable route - Dubai, Istanbul, Libya, Italy, Amerstam, Frankfurt, Luanda and more - friends were concerned at my choice of Kigali - there was no need.

"So it was the first time I was travelling on RwandAir, the reason was I got a cheap return ticket from NBO-BOM at around $190 somewhat.
I was worried about the kind of service that this airline is going to provide as I have seen mixed reviews on various forums.
But after flying on this airline I can say it was really nice.
The staff was very polite and helpful.
Seats were very comfortable and hygiene was good.
Only drawback you may find is that they don't provide any in house entertainment in form of screens, but that's ok if you can get a cheap air ticket.
If you are flying from africa you may not find much options in vegetarian food, I was served only with biscuits and nuts even after booking a veg meal.

"I took RwandAir to Abidjan via Douala in Cameroon and it was worth the price and the journey.
For check in, it seems to me that they are slow, they should speed up a little.

"I travel extensively and experience many airlines most of which gives a mediocre or average level of service. I don't often praise airlines but in this instance I feel I have to recommend Rwandair without any hesitation.

The cabin service is attentive with good quality food and drinks. The aircraft are modern and mostly new, the seat pitch is good and the cabin cleaned and in very good order. There is a good entertainment system with good screens. The timing is very punctual with a reasonable number but not too many announcements.

I experience their new service from Gatwick and I would certainly use it for other destinations in Africa. If you want an airline that is professionally run, with good timekeeping and excellent cabin service I have no hesitation in recommending Rwandair.

"Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Few exclaiming words to describe Rwandair. Young, but already paying attention to what flying customers require. My family and I had to do 2-legs either way, and while there was some legroom challenges on the smaller plane used to and from Kigali (from and to Johannesburg), the Kigali-Lagos journeys were a bliss. Wide-bodied and roomy aircraft, with ample legroom, and good in-flight menu, throughout journey. An added exciting service offering on-board, wi-fi, did not work for me, could be because I didn't know how-to (Rwandair pls take note to explain to passengers), and also tried abortively to check-in online (Kept on showing loading sign), and this prevented me from customising my diabetic diet request prior to boarding...however, one cabin crew got me a bowl full of mixed fruits.

"RwandAir has set it sights on becoming a world-class carrier, with Kigali as an international transit hub competing directly with Nairobi (and its deteriorating Kenya Airways). Anyone who knows this country and its recent history has to believe that they will accomplish this. But they are definitely not there yet. Their fleet is new; I flew to and from Kigali on spotless, up-to-date Boeing 737's (700 and 800 series). Their cabin and ground staff are friendly and helpful, but the cabin staff often seemed uncertain. Food in economy was mediocre even by economy standards. The movie on my return trip was originally in English but shown only with a dubbed French soundtrack, and there was no onscreen flight-tracking map. Their website is terrible. You can't select seats for economy flights, so I used their South Africa agent to obtain pre-assigned seats. But that still didn't work for my return flight, where I was assigned the wrong seat in spite of the agent's promise and two advance calls to their Kigali office. Also, their website won't accept credit cards with a different billing address. I would choose RwandAir again over Kenya Airways for flights to Kigali, but not for longer journeys at this point.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/74/22/c5/phil-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598PhilC,Phil C wrote a review Apr 2017,Phil C,"Falls Church, Virginia",218 contributions,107 helpful votes,Kigali - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r478165959-RwandAir-World.html,Good potential but not yet world class,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was April 27 and we were flying back to Entebbe, connecting through Kigali. But the incoming flight was late, very late, for technical reasons. It looked like we would miss our ticketed connection. When we eventually took off, it was obvious that we wouldn't have landed before the connecting flight had taken off - in fact we were going to miss by 20-30 minutes. We did ask what will happen - we told don't worry the plane will wait for you - I think there were 5-7 passengers affected.

Our plane landed and we headed down the steps. At the same time, baggage handlers had clambered into our plane, to get our luggage. At the foot of the steps was a bus. We climbed on and off went the bus, racing across the tarmac. We reached another plane - our connecting flight. Not sure whether the baggage had beaten us there. Up the steps we went.

We smiled at the other passengers who'd waited for us. We sat down, we strapped in, and off we went.

Kudos to every Rwandair flight attendant who work hard to make us happy with their smile, care and services",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/c8/7a/70/hirwa-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hirwad,Hirwa D wrote a review Mar 2016,Hirwa D,,44 contributions,4 helpful votes,Kigali - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r358084895-RwandAir-World.html,Interesting customer services & experiences,Date of travel: December 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown with RwandAir a couple of time over the past few months. First time around was around Sept 2015. I thought I was just lucky with a brand new Boeing, great staff and great service. Since then I have used them a couple of time to fly in East Africa and the Johannesburg to Lusaka leg. Every time a good experience. I am now an ambassador of this airline as they really get it right every time. Well done guys !

PS - I am not sure why symsdad would have a very bad experience. Having your credit card on you ( the one you bought the ticket with ) is pretty standard procedure these days with a number of airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/e9/b2/fb/safari-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SafariM,Safari M wrote a review Mar 2016,Safari M,"Johannesburg, South Africa",160 contributions,68 helpful votes,Nairobi - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r356932315-RwandAir-World.html,Awesome Experience,Date of travel: March 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Brand new aircraft, friendly service, timely flights and good food.

I flew with them 4 times in a space of three weeks. Should Rwandair keep this up, they could soon be the go-to airline not just for the region but for the entire continent. Watch this space, there is a new kid on the block.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabriel9431,Gabriel9431 wrote a review Mar 2016,Gabriel9431,"Stockholm, Sweden",252 contributions,54 helpful votes,Kigali - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r356159049-RwandAir-World.html,Probably the best airline in the region,Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very bad experience with RwandAir's customer service and that's really a shame because the actual flights were on time, comfortable and the food was great.  Although we had our passports, driver's licenses, the email conformation and other credit cards with us, they would not let us fly because we didn't bring the credit card we booked the tickets with.  Instead we had to buy new, more expensive tickets to be able to get to our gorilla safari.  Three weeks later, we're still waiting for a credit to show up for the original tickets.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/4a/86/61/symsdad.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/symsdad,symsdad wrote a review Feb 2016,symsdad,"Penfield, New York",173 contributions,172 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r351970476-RwandAir-World.html,Make sure you bring the credit card you used to buy your ticket,Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
