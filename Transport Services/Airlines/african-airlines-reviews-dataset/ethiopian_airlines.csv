"Ethiopian Airlines cancelled my flight 3 weeks before due departure date, for ""unforeseen reasons."" Then, offered to reinstate a seat on a flight a week later, ""subject to availability."" No guarantees given. How could accommodation be booked with such uncertainty ? I opted for a refund, and got only a partial refund, after the travel agent had to repeatedly beg for it.  They cancelled , I did not, and yet still got only part of the ticket price back. A scam that must leave many customers poorer.

"For starters the plane is old and raggedy and makes a lot of noise. Probably shouldn’t even be allowed to fly. Second all of the flight attendants are rude And honestly i think most of them are racist against anyone non-Ethiopian. 13 hour flight they give you two small cups of beverage and get attitude when you ask for more like it’s coming out of their check. One flight attendant was the only one actually doing her job. Kids were playing in the bathroom and completely ripped the door off, but people were still going in the bathroom and urinating with the door open, not a flight attendant in sight. To be quite honest i wouldn’t have never flown Ethiopian airways if they weren’t a star alliance partner as I’m a gold member with United and my uncle is also on board so i will be reporting this at the next star alliance meeting, as this aircraft or staff doesn’t meet star alliance quality standards I’m sure not their customer service standards. This airlines has more negative reviews than positive. I need everyone going forward to file a formal complaint and make sure to get names as i did, then take it a step further and submit a formal complaint to star alliance, as well as the FAA in regards to some of the safety issues/concerns.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poohmac83,Mike wrote a review Nov 26,Mike,"Ontario, California",6 contributions,4 helpful votes,Chicago - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r869815087-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst Airline in the world,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The aircraft from EWR to LFW was very old. This was on 11/15/22. The air frame was creaking throughout the flight, there was water leaking at the main door to the plane and water leaked into the cabin during the flight as well. The seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed to be 30 years old. I wonder why it's deemed airworthy. The return trip on 11/20/22 was slightly better, because the aircraft used was an improvement of sorts - no leaks into the cabin and no creaking of the air frame, but the seats were still very hard. I actually have back pain today, 11/26/22, mainly as a result of sitting on  those hard seats for 10+ hours each way. I think Ethiopian has serious issues with the quality and age of it's planes, and they shouldn't mistreat an disrespect passengers going to African destinations by using very old aircraft.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128akint,Akin T wrote a review Nov 26,Akin T,,1 contribution,,Newark - Lome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r869735801-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Very old aircratts with water leakage into cabin, creaking frame and loose ceiling flaps in the cabin.",Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Dulles airport (Washington DC) to Kilimanjaro airport via Addis Ababa, then back to Dulles from Zanzibar via Addis Ababa for a safari and beach vacation in Tanzania. I flew economy on the way there, and business class from Addis Ababa to Dulles on the way back. This is by far the worst airline I've ever flown.

The economy flight from Dulles to Africa: It was 13 hours. The airplane itself was in less-than average condition. My seat did not recline. There was a screaming infant behind me who not only kicked my chair the whole way to Africa but at one point reached over the seat and pulled my hair so hard some of it came out, all while the father laughed. The food was quite bad-gristly beef curry with rice. We were seated at a bulkhead --seats we'd paid an extra $99 for as ""premium"" seats -- and after takeoff a man from a couple of rows behind us came up and stacked one large piece of luggage and one large backpack right in front of me so that I had no leg room. When I complained to him he acted like he didn't understand me and left the bags there. When I told the flight attendant she ignored me and did nothing about it. When it was time for landing and everything was supposed to be stowed up above the flight attendants still did nothing about this luggage and I had to flag one down -- I wasn't going to let these bags that weren't even mine fly in my face and hurt me upon landing. She was very irritated to be bothered but finally told the man he had to move the luggage. He put it in his seat and STOOD IN THE AISLE for landing. Unbelievable. There seemed to be a number of people on the plane who are very unfamiliar with the rules/etiquette of flying. It was very noisy. The plane from Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro was in a bit better shape, but my tv thing did not work. The food was equally bad. There were no a/c vents above the seats on either flight and it got quite hot. Both flights did leave on time, and boarding processes were smooth -- I'll give them that.

Flights home from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa, and Addis to Dulles: We were in economy class from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa, which made sense as it was a relatively short flight. Bad food, inattentive service, tv in my chair did not work -- again. But got to Addis fairly quickly. Because we had bid on upgrades for the Addis to Dulles flight and gotten the business class tickets we went to the Cloud 9 lounge at the Addis Ababa airport. They printed out our boarding passes for us. The lounge is very large, but it nevertheless got very, very crowded and loud. I went to go into the quiet room to rest for a bit but a young mother had decided to use that room as a playroom for her two very young boys, who were running around, yelling, and playing loud video games -- so much for the quiet room. They did have plentiful free food. Business class on the flight home was much, much better than coach, obviously, but not as nice as business class on other planes. The best feature is that you can get your seat about 97% flat. So I was able to sleep much of the trip home. They give you a pillow, and blanket and a small toiletry kit. That flight is interrupted by a fuel stop in Dublin halfway though, so you will have to wake up with the lights on and sit your seat all the way up. The dinner served shortly after we got on the plane was pretty bad. But the ""lunch ""(inexplicably served at what I think was about 4am Washington DC time as we got close to DC) was traditional Ethiopian food and it was very good. The entertainment center / tv screens are kind of hard to figure out, working them with the remote isn't easy, and they are supposed to be touch screen but the touch screen feature didn't work on mine (didn't work on my husband's either). Again, no air vents on either flight and it got quite hot. I've never been on planes that didn't have those little air vents -- but none of my Ethiopian airplanes had them.

The ""bidding"" process for upgrades was something I wasn't crazy about. You bid on upgrades and when someone outbids you they let you know so that you increase your bid. This went on and on and I imagine they got a lot more money this way -- by basically getting passengers into bidding wars with each other for upgrades.

Now comes the part I'm really irritated about. My bag did not arrive back in the States. My husband's bag did, and mine did not. We filled out a claim at the airport with an Ethiopian Airlines representative in the baggage area. I discover when I get home, after making my lost bag report at the airport, that in order to track my lost bag on their website I was supposed to have been given a property irregularity report (PIR) number -- and I was not given one. I contacted the Dulles Ethiopian Airlines manager by email (the only relevant email I could find on the website) and he forwarded my email to someone else cc'ing me asking them to look into it. I've heard nothing back. I was told my bag would be delivered to my house within 24 hours. It's now been almost 36 and no bag and no email with any information about where it is. I am afraid, especially given the other reviews I see here, that it was likely just stolen rather than lost in transit. So I doubt it is coming.

I will never fly this airline again and very much recommend against it. Not worth it. Find another way to get to your destination in Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/b1/ee/ad/fand.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fand,fand wrote a review Nov 25,fand,"Falls Church, Virginia",242 contributions,131 helpful votes,Washington DC - Kilimanjaro National Park,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r869689870-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst Airline I Have Flown,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The customer service from Ethiopia airline staff at Manchester airport was fantastic.
The staff in the lounge area, the fast track, and inside the flight on the business class cabin were excellent, with great customer service.
We also enjoyed our layover in Addis-Ababa airport, great lounge.

"The lounge in Stockholm by SAS was OK but nothing to brag about. The aircraft to Adis was a Boeing 787 with fully flat seats and lots of storage space for hand luggage. Food onboard was good with ample choices. The food in the lounge at Adis is really sumptuous. In addition to international dishes it also offers a selection of Ethiopian dishes that were very tasty. Amenities includes silent room for sleeping, showers and massage. The direct flight from Adis to Kigali was replaced by a flight via Burundi. This delayed us by 2 - 3 hours, but we did not mind so much because the flight turned out to also be by a Boeing 787 (instead of the much smaller Airbus that would have normally been used). Furthermore, in the post Covid era we were happy the flight did not get cancelled altogether.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forgot_it_again,Jamila and Eric Anderson wrote a review Nov 20,Jamila and Eric Anderson,,3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Stockholm - Kigali,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r869079864-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good stuff,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had travell with Ethipian airlines severas times, always wishing that the same thing that happened to me before will change but it didn't, it was always a big mistake
I travelled long distante with my kids and the 6 times I used ethiopian airlines the tablet o the seat were never working, a trip with a kid  5 years old and one 1 Years old is very hard, they also never gave any playing kit for the kids, I asked man times and they just answerd they don't have. The light on the top was also ON all the trip, on my face 16 hours and it wasn't working as well and of course they couldn't do anything about.
An other time The crew from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo and the other crew from Sao Paulo to Ethipian were rude, answering in a bad mood, making faces between them and running all time, shouting at ppl... oh God, it was just terrible.
I didn't travell with my husband so I expected some help from the crew but nothing happed, when they saw me carrying my baby and bags and my other daughter scared, they didn't even try to help me with the bags, I needed to ask and the face of the service crew was like I'm busy mum...

"I read a lot of let's call them not so good reviews about Ethiopian. It seemed that once you fly, you're ok, otherwise, contact center sucks, long waiting times in calls and they have problems in managing luggage and complaints. So, we were a bit worry about these flights, as they were part of a much-anticipated holiday. This is how reality looked for us.

Bucharest to Vic Falls and return via Vienna and Addis Ababa. Flights between Vienna and Bucharest on Austrian, all the others operated by Ethiopian, the entire booking on Ethiopian website.
Pro's
Excellent flights, food more than ok on all 4 segments (Vienna to Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa to Vic Falls and return). Efficient on-board service, attentive staff, well-maintained planes (787-9 and 737 max), comfy seats. Luggage on time and in good condition despite being transborded 2 times. A truly 5-star flight experience.
Con's
Although the website and the mobile app are looking good and are quite easy to use, for some reasons, it's impossible to add anything on your booking: meals, seats, ... It's impossible even to change the currency in which the prices are displayed. All these must be done through their contact center. Even a flight change notification must be confirmed via contact center. The good thing is that I waited for less than 1 minute each time I called them before I could speak to an operator.

"I flew from Addis Ababa to New York on Ethiopian airlines. I found on board internet service available on more planes. One hour for 5 USD, two hours for 9 USD, three hours for 15 USD and entire flight for 25 USD. It functioned ok with mobile phone, I could even see some YouTube, but may get slower if you have heavy data requirements. The flight stops at Lome. Togo, for refueling and taking on additional passengers. Continuing passengers used to stay on board but apparently now everybody has to deplane to the boarding lounge before allied. back in.

Small nuisance is that, somehow, Ethiopian airlines seems to always mix up priority luggages and others. I have never seen priority luggages coming out first upon arrival. Can the airline do something to improve?

Business class food/beverage service is nice but it takes very long time to finish. It is OK for super long flight but for medium-short flight it feels as if the whole flight was spent on food service.

"For certain gates they've added ANOTHER security screening, and they confiscate all drinks you have on you despite it having been bought INSIDE the terminal.

Not only does this not make any security sense; they've cleared the goods into the terminal themselves, but it's also discriminatory as people at other gates that don't have the extra security clearance can take on board any drinks or other items they've bought in the terminal.

I challenged the people that took my drinks off me and they just ignored me. Refused to even look at me.

"I was asked by a female staff to go and get an OK to travel permit before I will be allowed to check-in. I showed her my permanent residence permit in Brazil and told her that I don't need an OK to travel before travelling to Brazil. She was very unfriendly and insisted that I need the OK to travel.

I followed the instructions and went upstairs to the office and met the person responsible to get the OK to travel. I equally explained that I have been travelling to Brazil and this is the first time I was asked to get an OK to travel despite my permanent residence permit.

He insisted that I need that. I spoke to another Ethiopian who is a staff and he said same thing. I was running out of time. I spent hours explaining and no one listened. I was told to go back and wait for the OK to trave permit. And rebook my flight and the extra cost if any will be one me.

The check-in was closing as the flight boarding announcement was made. I became so sad and depressed.

I came downstairs to pick my luggage to go back home. Fortunately, there was another lady at the passport checking point and I walked up to her to give my last complaint. She was so surprised that a staff sent me to get an OK to travel when I have a permanent residence permit in Brazil. She scanned my passport and ordered the last person at the check-in desk to check me in immediately.

I ran all the way through immigration to be able to catch up before the boarding gate was closed. The pain and trauma of this experience is unimaginable.

I am so much disappointed with your staff in Lagos International Airport Nigeria for their level of ignorance and incompetence which put me through emotional, psychological, physical and mental stress.

I hope that you look into this and and get your staff properly trained and informed to avoid this repeating. I can imagine that some people must have been put through this in the past. As we look up to the future, I hope that the staff attention will be called. I don't know her name. But I met her on 29th October at the passport check point in Lagos for Ethiopia flight to Addis 13:40 and she is a slim lady.

If this is not addressed properly, I will make an official complaint with damages included with the help of my advocate.

"My partner and I flew the route Johannesburg-Addis Ababa-Mahe-Addis Ababa-Cape Town. I checked in two large new suitcases and when it arrived with us at Mahe Airport both suitcases broken into and unfortunately we saw it only after we left the airport. After we arrived at our accomodation and a short rest after our long journey I opened and unpacked my bags and realised that both bags were broken into as there were marks of forced entry on both bags (pictured) and my belongings were in a mess with items worth around $500 of items taken from my bags with very old pictures that cannot be replaced :( we went back to the airport in less than 24 hours and the baggage department wouldn’t file a report as we have left the airport and we also went to the Ethiopian Airlines office and conveniently the person responsible for baggage was off duty. I called the Ethiopian Airlines contact centre with the number listed on their offical website and he directed me to a report page that doesn’t exist. Till now, no one from the airline is willing to help us with our case. With the large volume of flights and lack of procedures to manage customers I gave up with this and anything to do with Ethiopian Airlines.

The Addis Ababa airport is also another story. There are constant bottle necks at security with not enough security guards watching peoples valuables when going through the scanning machine. You must stay vigilant when going through Addis Ababa airport! There are oceans of people coming in all directions at all times. Additionally, there are no water fountains at the airport and expect to pay $2 US for each small still water bottle.

The Ethiopian Airlines seats on our journey were all cramped and we ate the same meal each time on our flights (pictured). We were overall very disheartened with our journey and never risking to fly with Ethiopian Airlines again! This will be the first and last time traveling with Ethiopian Airlines.

"Booking a fligt with Ethiopian airlines is a nigtmare!!! I tried to sign up and the website kept saying ""Something went wrong"" and after 7 times I tried to book a flight online. The website is not user friends and a ticket that was around $2,200 ended up costing $2,880! including surcharges even though they say if you book online you get a discount. I called customer service and they said book online its cheaper. After about 10 times trying to either book or sign up without any success I give up on this airline for now. I will try other airlines because I need to travel.

To add insult to injury trying to get reimbursed has been a nightmare.  Ethiopian airlines sent a form to list everything which was in my suitcase which I did.  They emailed me back and offered to pay for 6 weeks of clothing, etc. $350 or $850 for credit toward a ticket. They told me I had to choose one or the other.  I discovered they are under The Warsaw Convention an international convention that regulates liability, in the event of an accident, for international carriage of persons, luggage, or goods performed by aircraft for reward.

"I can only recommend: DO NOT fly with Ethopian Airlines. This was only the second time we travelled with this airline and already got robbed. If you google ‚Ethopian Airlines’ und ‚theft’ you will be shown hundreds of results where similar incidents are described.  I guess the only reason we they didn’t break open our bags the first time was, because there was not enough time in Addis Ababa between the connecting flights. Now it was different, we had a layover and the Airlines ground staff had plenty of time to rob the passengers. One of our  bags were secured with a padlock which we found was removed and my husband’s hair trimming machine was missing. Now the procedure is to complain at the airlines representative in the destination airport but at Brazzaville airport there’s no Ethopian representative and the Airport staff in Brazzaville who should deal with missing luggage doesn’t speak a single word of English and also  refuses to help with thefts, but in Congo Airports they don’t  care about passengers concerns anyway.

"I have to say the the Economy flights experience was extremely poor !

The staff were disinterested - the air Stewardess actually fell asleep in front of us on the descent into London - they did not respond to the call bell - we sat next to the emergency exit but received no briefing not even the usual card - they stood slovenly against the bulk head as the emergency briefing took place - both embarkation and getting off the plane was both chaotic and disorganized.

The food choice was extremely limited and very poor and the toilets were a disgrace. Our ear phones did not fit into the control panel on our TV etc which meant that we had no sound for what was in any event an aged film / TV option schedule.

If this is typical of the airline as a whole they have a huge amount of back to basis to learn if they are to achieve their ambition competing with the best in the industry.

"Got my flight canceled 3 times with no notice.

It took months but I got almost all of it they still kept about $20 or $40 but I was tired and over it by that point as long as I got 90% of it back that's all that matter.

"I booked a ticket from Harare to Hargeisa over the phone because it was a lot cheaper, despite the supposed discount for booking online. I was sent a link to pay but there was no button to click on to actually pay. I called the office in London and they sent me another link which still didn't work. I called again and this time was put on hold for 20 minutes and then had the phone put down on me. I called again the following morning, was again sent the same link that didn't work. I called again, and this time I was told to go to my local office in Harare to pay. I am in the UK so they were my local office. I told them that and they gave me a number to call, which turned out to be the number they were on. I pointed out that on the link that they kept sending me it said you could pay over the phone and the number I was calling was the one I could use. I couldn't. Eventually they told me that I had to go to the office in London to pay, a round trip of about 10 hours and costing over £150 in train fares alone. The service I have had is unbelievably bad, I don't know how this company keeps going. The information on the website was wrong, the links didn't work, the staff were badly trained and didn't know what was going on, I was passed round the houses and finally given the brush off.

"This as a weird kind of trip. From stavanger to Lusaka via addis, with return to trondheim. A lot of flying in between. Always Ethiopian. Generally happy with the choice. Luggage handling good. Food ok. No delays no fuzz. Ok service and good information about hotel vouchers and visas during layover in addis. (hotel was in the low-end though). Check-in smoothly and everything ok.

Airplanes clean as we left, but a few more rounds with bins would've been appropiate as it was littered on arrival at destination.

Bole airport is a mess to get through on the hotel voucher thing (3hrs, only queueing to get stamps). And info hard to hear. So make sure to ask attendants by the line if you have the paperwork needed at the end of the queue, else you end up queueing twice...

"I have never seen such poor treatment from an airline like l experienced with Ethiopian Airlines. They try to get as much money from customers as possible. Very unprofessional behavior from staff.. First they said our bags were overweight then we took staff out reweighed then went back and they then said the bag was too big then charged us £80. We proceed to the boarding gate then they said my wife was not traveling because apparently she had bleach in her bag which was already on the plane.They took off the bag and when she checked the bag in the hotel there was no bleach. We were forced to rebook her ticket with a different airline costing us £1200. The staff tried to charge me £80 for an oversized hand luggage because it could not fit into that measuring thing just before you board. Staff were so rude and unprofessional. I will never fly with this airline again. We were a family of 5 and the children were crying because mum could not travel with us because of bleach which was not even in the bag. Holiday spoiled, mid air on way back on 9th of September rude staff, had to literally beg for a blanket for my disabled son. Please don’t use this airline l feel cheated. For a family of
5 I would rather use Emirates even though it’s longer. Never again. To add insult onto injury they said my wife can use the ticket within the next 12 months by herself, what about us as the family.

"I’m a frequent international traveler and can say without a doubt Ethiopian Airlines is the absolute worst. The interior is gross, it needs a deep cleaning. Food crumbs and stains on the seats, between the seats, on the floor and the seat back pocket. I’ve never seen such a dirty plane. Oh… and check out the large, nasty brown drool stains on the pillow they handed out. I asked for a clean pillow and they gave me another one with another drool stain lmao. So clearly they are reusing the pillows without washing. So freaking disgusting, especially during Covid times. I find it hilarious that they made the passengers stay masked on the flight but handed out unsanitary, used pillows. Cool. Many things also broken on the plane, my usb charger at my seat was broken, the inflight entertainment is super buggy (and the movie selection SUCKED), seat back pockets are falling off the seats. The interior looks run down as hell. I booked a window, nope it was switched to aisle. Food is not good and it’s the same for every single meal- rice and meat and a roll with butter. That sucked after 17.5 hours (yes the flight was that long). No ice for drinks and they don’t give enough drinks period- I was so thirsty. That has never happened to me before on a long haul flight. And to top it off they lost one of my checked bags. Customer service is non existent. Flight attendants are not very pleasant either.

I booked with Ethiopian because it was the cheapest option but sometimes cheap is not worth it.

"Ethiopian Airlines charged me $6,215 just for one flight. It is not fair. I used this airlines for the first time and got this unfortunate situation. I would never ever use this airline or recommend for any one I know. Though I paid $2,215 for two ways at the beginning, my flight was canceled due to covid19. I informed the Ethiopian Airlines in my country, but they would not care or take responsibility of people whose airticket was canceled due to the pandemic, COVID19. They told me to pay $4,000 with business class as there was no seat with economic class. I had no option. I had to pay $4,000 additional fees to come back to USA. Total $6,215, only for 1 person, very sad and annoying. HOW CAN YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC? The Turkish or Dubai Airlines reserve seats for their clients who get affected by COVID19. However, the Ethiopian Airlines do not care of their clients who get affected with Covid19.

"A friend and I travelled to Tanzania in August 2022 with Ethiopian Airlines. We chose it as it offered better prices than other airlines. The flight had a layover in Addis Ababa and offered a transit visa and a free hotel voucher. We were not informed of that, so we had applied for an e-visa to Ethiopia before the trip. The hotel selected by the airline had no hot water in the room - they offered me a hot water bucket to shower! On our way back, we decided to use the e-visa and pay for a better hotel.

"This has been the most stressful flight experience I have ever encountered in my life. They have the WORST WORST WORST Customer Service in the history of Airlines. It is a pity being African living in Europe that this is the Airline of choice going to visit my hometown, but this will be my last trip with ETH.

My suitcases were lost on our journey. We received 2/4 suitcases, and 1 that was not ours. We asked the delivery guy to return it as it was not ours but they marked that we have received all 4 of our suitcases. Thank God I took pictures to show the mismatch and error, but Ethiopian Airlines still does not want to take responsibility. It has been 1 month and a half going back and forth - whenever the process is going ahead, they cancel, do not communicate and close cases while you think some progress is being made. The fact that 3 companies were involved, it has been a nightmare and my suitcase is still not delivered, located or found. But ETH refuses to help, support and only tell me to deal with the courier, which in fact has nothing to do with me. I pray no one has to go through this stress!

"On arrival at Harare airport the check in staff told us our flight had been cancelled and we were booked for the following day.  We were furious as we had no notification even though they insisted they sent us a msg. I am yet to find it.  They were not concerned that we had a  prepaid hotel booking non-refundable and an important specialist appointment that I was going to miss, not to mention losing one day of our holiday.  I asked to be re-rerouted but they were not interested and basically a sorry cleared them of everything!!!!!!When we eventually boarded,the crew on board were not very friendly. After advising them not to wake me up for dinner, the same air hostess not only woke me up for dinner but for any little thing like to check my seat belt etc. I  was not amused and asked her if she actually understood English.

"The worst flight experience in my life was my return flight from Abidjan to Bahrain with Ethiopian Airlines! Never have I experienced such unprofessional, incompetent and directly RUDE staff! I highly recommend you TO AVOID Ethiopian Airlines.
First of all, the only let passengers know that the first flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was cancelled 4 hours AFTER planned departure. After this, still no information about the rest of our journey for us passengers with connecting flights. Only the day after when a new flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was coming (24 hours after cancelled one), they informed me that they had changed my booking to fly over Dubai and then to Bahrain with 'flydubai'. This will prolonge my flight time with 29 hours, and I now miss out on a full day at work. This itinerary appeared from my online booking but they did not give me any boarding pass or other kind of documentation. They just told me to deal with it in Dubai. Arriving in Dubai at 3am well in advance of my flight with flydubai scheduled for 7:15am, turns out that NO ONE from Ethiopian Airlines had actually made any booking for me at all! The staff from flydubai tells me that their only chance to rebook me is the night flight at 17:00 thus I could look forward to another 10 hours in Dubai airport. This is not possible for me already dead-tired and supposed to be at work. I therefore run back to the gate where Ethiopian Airlines is boarding the flight back to Addis Ababa. there was a full queue of people waiting to board the flight back to Addis Ababa. I patiently joined the end of the queue and waited until it got my turn. I kindly told one of the Ethiopian Airlines staff that once he had finished with boarding the passengers, I had a claim. However, once the full flight was boarded the staff I had been talking to, turned to his Ethiopian airlines colleagues and start chatting and laughing, COMPLETELY ignoring me. I burst out into tears. I felt neglected and ridiculed. They then casually left the gate, leaving me behind with NO flight to my final destination. I was literally stranded in Dubai!!!
It was only because I begged an Dubai airport staff present at the gate to help me out. He offered me to sit in the airport lounge and the airport's cost because he said that Ethiopian Airlines is never willing to offer anything for their stranded passengers. The friendly airport staff finally got me another flight at 12:55. I thus landed to my final destination, 47 hours after I first arrived in Abidjan and 28 hours after my departure. However, the worst part was my 10 HOURS in Dubai airport where I for 7 HOURS did not know when I would be flying back home. If it was not for the friendly airport staff who reacted to my crying, I would still be in Dubai airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ansolysbeck,Annasofie Lysbeck Olsen wrote a review Aug 2022,Annasofie Lysbeck Olsen,,3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Abidjan - Bahrain,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r854382555-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The WORST flight experience in my life was my return flight from Abidjan to Bahrain with Ethiopian Airlines!,Date of travel: August 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A special thank you to Feven and her team.  The food was delicious and beyond plentiful.  Starting our flight and ending our flight with champagne,  wine and other alcoholic beverages were plentiful.  We just to sample some authentic Ethiopian cuisine as well.  Delicious!

"This airline has gone so bad and is only living on its former glorious reputation.  There are many bad review from many passengers already; but I noticed the following:1- Although the minority of passengers, white or Caucasians tend to get better service for some reason.  The majority of passengers happen to be black, brown, and Arabs and they are treated with disdain - this observation was made over a number of trips.  That is really terrible and backward attitude;2- Customer service department is non-responsive.  They conveniently ignore your messages and don't even acknowledge the messages.  Can't trust them to be there  for you when you really need their help.  You will be better off staying away.3- Unless your name sounds Caucasian - they will not even consider your claim for refund for the COVID-19 pandemic cancellations - that is racist and plain robbery.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaO9740AF,J A wrote a review Aug 2022,J A,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Toronto - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r853133976-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Terrible Customer Service overall,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Yes, they have shiney new aircraft, however that's generally were the fun stops. Customer service in the many years of experience of using this airline has never been up-to what you expect from a Star Alliance member.
So on the 2/8/2022 my wife and 17 month old daughter arrived from Dublin on a SAS flight, no-one at the airport was there to arrange the transfer to T5 from T2 this took over an hour to get help. Apon arrival at T5 they were dumped in a departure lounge/gate area with no facilities at all and left there for over 20 hours. They had 1 little cafe that open just before all the flights started to depart. Thankfully the kind lady in the cafe helped my wife with hot water and some milk for my daughter.
If they had a pet dog travelling with them, it would have recieved far greater care!

"It is my first experience with Ethiopian Airlines and I am pleasantly surprised by their overall service as flight, pre-boarding, and onboard services.  Left Hong Kong and arrived in Bangkok as per schedule. All is well, except there is a need that the crew is better versed on the required immigration procedures at the port of arrival as well as what is required to show to the authority as per COVID rules. Nobody had a clue and hence I was handed over a document wherein I had to state I am COVID positive (which is not the case) and for the rest, I drew a full blank from all crew members. Neither do they know that no immigration arrival cards are anymore required at the port of arrival?

"I've never had this happen before in my over 1M miles flown.  We booked round trip tickets to and from Tanzania from Washington Dulles.  We found the least connections and fastest option is Ethiopian Airlines unless you want to add an additional 5-6 hours onto your flight via Istanbul to use Turkish Airlines (which I prefer).  Flight cost was reasonable but not cheap as we chose business class/Cloud Nine.  Both directions we booked a very comfortable layover in Addis Ababa so that I could walk the distance between flights comfortably.  I have arthritis and it's very hard for me to walk fast after sitting for long periods, so I book accordingly.  On our return flight, we boarded in Kilimanjaro, flight looked to be on time, and we had two hours in Addis Ababa.  As soon as the last passenger boarded, and flight crew prepared for take-off the pilot made an announcement that they are going to add a stop in Dar es Salaam to pick up some passengers.  What???  This added an additional hour and 30 minutes to our flight.  What was worse if that when we picked up those passengers in Dar one didn't get on but checked luggage.  Another 30 minutes counting passengers and getting his baggage off the flight.  We now arrived in Addis Ababa AFTER boarding began for our long-haul flight to IAD.  We were escorted off the plane to a bus, bus to lower-level processing area for international travelers, went through passport control (line - wait) then up through to terminal to 'run', as best I could, to our next flight which fortunately was still boarding past the time they normally close the doors.  Once on board, plane doors shut, pilot announces a delay due to baggage handling.  Would have loved those extra minutes which turned into an hour delay!  Half the plane coming to Addis Ababa was making long haul international connections.  When we ran past the ORD flight, we noticed that those who were behind us in passport queue likely didn't make it.  In addition to this chaos I've never experienced, the flight crew couldn't be less concerned about the passengers' connections concerns and offered little to no help.  In fact, towards the end of the flight I heard some curt responses coming from the attendants to reasonable questions from others regarding their connections.  The food was terrible, the plain, on all four legs, were filthy.  I would definitely avoid Ethiopian at all costs, both financial and time related in the future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/a0/9a/18/daphnesmom-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daphnesmom_11,Daphnesmom_11 wrote a review Aug 2022,Daphnesmom_11,"Leesburg, Virginia",78 contributions,77 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Washington DC,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r851788139-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Unscheduled flight diversion without notice for their convenience,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew with Ethiopian t/r from Johannesburg to Oslo, and the food was just inedible. The meat looked like cat food and on one flight the side to a pasta dish (the pasta was falling apart) was just more cold pasta. The service onboard was incredible slow and they gave very little info. We had a stopover in Sweden for around 2 hours early in the morning and they closed the toilets to prevent people from getting up from their seats to count the passengers- which I guess is ok enough, but there was no information about the closed toilets or the counting so the passengers got up to wait in line to use the toilets, and were then told to sit back down AND then the staff had to start counting over again and again. Just very chaotic and frustrating.

They don’t answer the phone if you try to call them either and we met a girl who had called customer service for 20 days to get help to find a bag the airline lost..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/25/11/c7/a4/jenssennorway.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenssenNorway,Jenssen wrote a review Aug 2022,Jenssen,"Oslo, Norway",15 contributions,9 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Oslo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r851472560-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst food I’ve ever had while flying,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst airline ever and I have never had such a horrific travel experience. My flight was delayed 7 hr at the start of my itinerary. I was never updated on the new departure time. I kept calling the global center (7x) and they would not verify the new departure time! My flight eventually left at 4am instead of 9pm but I missed all my travel connections and the start of my safari vacation. All my vacation plans had to be changed at last minute and this was extremely stressful and worrisome. Then Ethiopian airlines lost my luggage for 7 days. No one from the airlines would help me. They kept saying they had no idea where the bag was even though I knew it was in Addis! The Ethiopian website is not helpful as it is not ever updated! No one contacted me so I had to spend my safari time following up. Finally after 5 days the airline said they would compensate me $100 for the lost bag (pitiful compensation)…but no one at Ethiopian Global office nor in DC would assist me. I am not able to get the compensation! The airlines said they can not help me and I needed to speak with their offices in South Africa! This has been a nightmare experience ! Especially on a business class ticket. For my safari, I was without clothes for half the vacation. Now I Can not get compensation. Everyone I speak to at Ethiopian airlines is extremely rude. No one will let me speak to a manager, or assist me or say they are sorry. On my way home, I had to fight to sit in the Ethiopian lounge. They said I could not sit in the lounge for more than 3 hr and my layover was longer. When I checked on my luggage in Johannesburg , they told the lounge staff I did not have any bags checked in although I had bag tags to prove I had checked luggage - my bag was missing again. I had not yet left Johannesburg. Ethiopian airlines ruined my very expensive vacation and still won’t let me speak to any management about this trip!

"Ethiopian Airlines are not what it used to be. From very stubborn unfriendly hostesses to appalling food.
The meals leave a lot to be desired. Even my 9 year old said she will never eat food on thus airline ever again. The main meal was chicken and rice or beef and rice but it was something else. Felt like you were eating gelatine.

We also had a delay to the flight from Addis ABBA to Johannesburg which resulted in us missing an internal flight and no one assumes responsibility for the consequences. I ended up hiring a vehicle at Johannesburg Airport to Durban as there were no other available flights with anyone else for two days.

The end of the journey resulted in a lost bag and it is now 6 days later and I do not have my bag. Many calls and complaints later and I have nothing.

I will never use Ethipian Airlines ever again. I used to think that it was the best airline in Africa. I learnt the truth the hard way.

"Malawian airlines is the subsidiary of Ethiopian airlines, with 49% stake by Ethiopian and the rest by the government of Malawi.

"Traumatic experience upon flight ET613 to Addis Ababa which was due to depart DXB at 5.40am 11/07/22.

Signs of an issue began to show when at 5.20am boarding was just beginning. By 6.15am, we were still on ground and people had begun complaining about the temperature as there was no AC, we were told it will work after takeoff. Passengers waited, security checks were made but still no take off, although the plane had left the gate. There was a brief announcement from the pilot stating that they were technical issues and that people should remain seated, however as more people complained about the now unbearable heat, cabin crew vanished and left us to fend for ourselves. Passengers began to panic, and started frantically removing luggage from the overhead lockers.

To sum it up, this was an extremely dangerous situation and the poor management of your staff only added to the panic. It wasn't until several passengers, myself included made calls to the emergency services that the police arrived and we were finally let off the plane. By this point it was just after 7am and some passengers even required medical assistance!

We waited a short while for buses to arrive and then sat on the buses for a further 20 minutes without moving! Being in another enclosed space was not ideal after what we had just been through. Once back in departures, Ethiopian Airlines representatives came over and informed the largely agitated crowd to go to a new gate and board the plane. He, however failed to inform us that it was in fact the same aircraft we had just disembarked!
If cabin crew had at least tried to reassure us that the issue was being dealt with, given updates and at least handed out water; then perhaps the situation would have been a little more bearable but to abandon a plane full of people who thought they 'were going to die' (some passengers were actually shouting this) is completely unacceptable.

After just having been through this traumatic experience, myself and a few other passengers were not willing to board the same aircraft and we spoke to Mr Teshome Regassa- operations manager to ask for our luggage. He then proceeded to tell me that I was delaying the plane by doing this and that it was just a small technical issue. This was extremely disrespectful as he was not the one who had just been stuck on a plane for nearly two hours with no AC, no assistance from staff, while passengers became angry and hysterical and babies screamed from the discomfort. I arrived at DXB at 3am and was at the gate well before the scheduled boarding time, so to be blamed for a delay which had nothing to do with me was absurd!

I've sent several emails and called countless times since 11/07/22, yet no response!
If using this airline avoid flight ET613, if you have a look at its flight history, you'll find many delays due to technical issues, yet these were supposedly fixed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinao187,Christina O wrote a review Jul 2022,Christina O,"London, United Kingdom",25 contributions,56 helpful votes,Dubai - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r847804984-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Shocking treatment by cabin crew and on ground manager!,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First and last time I accept a flight from my employer operated by this airline. If I was to say the service provided was amateur would be a compliment, which is a good indication of just how bad they are. No option to pick a seat 24hrs prior to the flight as the website was saying there is a fault with the system and the same on the day of travel. Arrived at Heathrow on BA flight, transit to terminal 2 to find Ethiopian Airlines does not bother to allocate staff to the transfers ticketing desk, so you have to wait till the gate is shown. I go the gate, by which time you are told that you are not checked in and the flight is overbooked. Now sat waiting to see if I have a seat. Never again, I swear.

"We travelled from Europe to Cape Town and back on ET. The experience was more than pathetic and this carrier should not be awarded to be part of the STAR Alliance Group. The product is inferior and the service pathetic.

Aircrafts:
They have some newish Airbus 350-900 which have a ok configuration but they are very squashed and don't feel very comfortable. The older B777-200 is past its life and should be retired. The aircraft from ADD to FCO was a piece of garbage. In Business Class upon take-off about 50% of the seats did not recline. After manual override and intervention by the crew they got some more seats fixed but were left with a number of seats that would not recline. In the end you pay for Business class but end up on a Economy style seat with a crew that is totally out of its depth to deal with.

Cleanliness:
The aircraft are filthy and unclean already on boarding. During the flight the bathrooms are not kept clean by the crew. There is ample staff but they are disorganised.

Procedures:
The crew does not follow basic safety proctoll. During take-off and landing neither seatbelts nor hand-luggage is checked for its safety. On landing of one sector a glass flew thru the cabin that was not collected before.

WIFI:
Although promoted as USD 25 for 24 hours on multiple sectors one had to pay another USD 25 for the second flight. No refund received despite a request.

Boarding:
A total mess.

Lounge in ADD:
Crowded and not clean, Quality of food is poor and wine selection even poorer.

Prio Bag:
Business Class luggage is not handled with priority and delivered with the rest of the bags - often towards the end. One one sector the bag did not arrive at all.

Summary:
This product is not worth to exist nor should be part of STAR Alliance. I strongly recommend to seek alternative options between Europe and Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHBBB,SHBBB wrote a review Jul 2022,SHBBB,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",394 contributions,220 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Rome,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r846778999-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Boeing 777-200 - old broken equipment,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The first surprise was in Chicago, when front desk people asked for $30 for covid test. They explained the ER govt asked them to collect it. I am ok with it but would have been nicer if this was communicated from the beginning when booking the flight.

Luggage delay!!!! My luggage was delayed 4 days. Would have been ok if it was just a delay. But it gets worse!!! Theft!!!!! I have heard of it form friends who used the airline before as well. $400 worth of my items was stolen. What a scheme, you make it delayed, and it is in your backyard to STEAL from it.

"Was travelling from Entebbe to Nosy Be Madagascar on 7th Jun'22 with my 18 colleagues for a corporate team building event. Our luggage was left behind in Addis during transit despite assurance by Airline staff that the luggage was on board.
All my clothes, personal effects and medication was in my luggage!!
How do you expect someone who has to take medication twice daily to stay for 5 Days without crucial medication?
Does the Airline take Responsibility??...What if something happens to someone's health due to the Airline's negligence and carelessness??
Finally when I got my luggage in Addis on 11th Jun on the way back to Entebbe, ...the bag was very dirty and oily ..one of my colleagues bag was damaged and the casing torn!!
This was the Worst and Most Traumatising experience for me in My travelling history!!

"We are a team of 19 people who travelled from Entebbe to Andilana Beach Resort, Nosy Be, Madagascar, for corporate team-building activities.

Why do we register this experience as a total disaster?
1. The economy class was very hot, near suffocation, and the seats were broken (23C). Wed complained to the captain, but he rudely ignored!

2. There was a delay in landing in Addis Ababa due to fog, which is understandable. HOWEVER, while boarding the connecting flight to Nosy Be, we asked the Airline Boarding Staff to first confirm the status of the check-in luggage of all 19 of us to ensure that it had been loaded on our flight. The Boarding Staff came with his senior manager and confirmed that all the luggage for the 19 people had been loaded on our transfer flight from Addis Ababa to Nosy Be.

3. We happily landed in Nosy Be on Tuesday, 7th June 2022, BUT shockingly, we were reluctantly told that all our check-in luggage for all 19 people was missing! The Airline Manager in Nosy Be seemed aware of this, and the whole team started avoiding us. We were further shocked to learn that there was no flight to bring our luggage till our departure on Saturday, 11th June 2022! Our team members almost collapsed because this trip had been planned for two years. We were stranded on an island, with a language barrier, no clothes, no reserve money and the worst part was that all our team building materials were in the luggage!

4. Finally, the Airline Manager offered each person USD 75 only for four days as compensation! But in Andilana Beach Resort, only one shirt costs USD 85! He was also kind enough to offer each of us a Star Alliance Overnight Kit.
SHOCKINGLY, all the products in the Star Alliance Overnight Kit are long expired!! How dare an international airline give expired products to their customers?

Imagine staying in a 4-Star hotel, with no changing clothes, no sandals, no shaving kit, no cosmetics and no medicines (4 of us are diabetic)! This is disastrous!
We had to forego the purpose of the trip, which was team building.

Don't you think we deserve compensation for the whole trip other than a simple sorry email?

Note: After a two-hour fracas in Addis, only 17 people managed to get luggage upon returning to Entebbe, One person got his luggage after one week, and another is still missing!

This kind of airline should not be used because they only add stress to passengers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/6b/e9/bc/venkatesh-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581venkateshk,Venkatesh K wrote a review Jun 2022,Venkatesh K,"Kampala, Uganda",114 contributions,21 helpful votes,Entebbe - Nosy Be,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r844489713-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Total Disaster!,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Before my departure, the Ethiopian airline sent me an email that my connecting flight was cancelled and they did not give me an alternative solution for my flight from Sydney to Bangkok. I had to constantly call the flight centre to arrange and make sure this is sorted. Upon arrival at the destination, my luggage was delayed and I was told to come the following day which I did and nothing. I end up spending two week in Togo with no luggages, no nothing. I had to buy every single thing you can think of. Both my luggages were delayed one was found a day before my departure and the other after I arrived back in Sydney. I went on their website to make a claim and complain and they DO NOT have such option either. WHO does that? what a nightmare. I spend more than I planned for and nothing to compensate.

"This is by far the worst travel experience I have ever had. You’re better off paying more and flying ANY other airlines.

Staff at Bole Airport could not care less about losing bags, delaying flights and there is no such thing as compensation for any of it!

Many people screaming at staff at the airport but they just don’t care. Most staff at the airport appear to be on holiday. Bag tags aren’t scanned and online system doesn’t work.

Additionally, flight attendants are very rude and unpleasant.

Would highly recommend never booking this airlines, if you’d like to save yourself a lot of frustration and anger and losing time and money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salemo629,Salem O wrote a review Jun 2022,Salem O,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,London - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r843803337-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Lost Bags, Delayed Flights, Horrible Staff, Dirty, Abusive.

"We booked a roundtrip through Ethiopian's webpage that included a stretch on each leg with Lufthansa.

Problem 1) It was not possible to check in online for the Lufthansa flight - neither via Lufthansa (""need to check in with Ethiopian"") nor with Ethiopian (no reason or option even given)

Problem 2) So we checked in at the Lufthansa counter in Nuremberg, since that was the first stretch. There, we were told that the cooperation between Ethiopian and Lufthansa was not very good as the software systems weren't compatible. So we needed to go to the Ethiopian counter at the next airport (Frankfurt) and present our luggage tags in order for the suitcases to be transferred into Ethiopian's system.

Problem 3) After waiting in line for 45 minutes at the Ethiopian counter upon arriving in Frankfurt, we were told that the luggage indeed was not yet in Ethiopian's system. At the same time, we were given new boarding passes for the next flight (without asking for them, because I had already checked in online) to Addis and told that boarding passes for the last flight to Ndola would need to be printed out in Addis.

Problem 4) When the agent printed out the boarding passes, she changed the seat for my toddler child to about 20 rows away from the rest of us. Of course I hadn't noticed right away, because I didn't expect her to change the seats we had selected and checked in for at home. So I had to stand in line another 30 minutes to get that fixed (could only be partly fixed, however).

Problem 5) The remainder of the trip then went surprisingly smooth, apart from Addis being a completely chaotic airport. But that was the smallest issue. Bigger issue was communication with Ethiopian. Since our layover in Frankfurt on the return trip was to be relatively short, I wrote Ethiopian and asked whether it was possible to get boarding passes for the Frankfurt -> Nuremberg stretch with Lufthansa at the Ethiopian counter upon our departure in Ndola. That was confirmed in writing. Then we received an email from Ethiopian - after we had checked in less than 48 hours before departure (not for the Lufthansa flight, of course, as that wasn't possible) - that our flight time had changed. However, not only our flight time had changed, also the departure airport was changed from Ndola to Lusaka. A distance of about 400km.

Problem 6) Eventually, we were contacted by the local Ethiopian office (the global office had told us that we needed to make our own way to Lusaka). They had booked a flight with a different airline to Lusaka, extending our trip by more than 3.5 hours and adding another stop. Also, we had to collect and check-in our luggage in Lusaka.

Problem 7) As expected, it was not possible to get boarding passes for the Lufthansa flight at the Ethiopian counter. We were told by the agent that she could not access Lufthansa's system.

Problem 8) I had premium seat reservations for the cancelled flight. It had been confirmed in writing that we would get the same seats on the replacement flights. However, upon check-in, we were told that those seats were not available and were given different seats. As a tall guy, I really like some extra leg room.

Problem 9) Of course, Ethiopian stopped responding to emails once I pointed out that literally all information they gave me was wrong.

Overall, it was a horrible experience. We managed to catch the connection in Frankfurt after running through Terminal 1 and getting boarding passes printed at the Lufthansa counter.

What annoyed me most, however, was the really poor (and now non-existent) communication on Ethiopian's part. Mistakes and problems can always arise, but with good and correct communication everything's just half as bad. But with Ethiopian, it was a complete mess and the horrible communication actually makes issues even worse, because you can't trust on Ethiopian to provide proper solutions.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackbO1863FY,Jack B wrote a review Jun 2022,Jack B,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Ndola - Nuremberg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r843573875-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,horrible all around experience,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The ladies at the check-in desks are rude and racist. I was travelling from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. I had checked in online so I took the shorter queue that had about 10 people. The ladies at the desk were super slow so it took us 45 minutes to get to the check in desk.

There was a white man infront of me who was served very fast. I had earlier tried to upload my details on the Ministry of Health website but the link was down. I tried explaining it to the lady at the desk but she rudely told me to step aside and wait to speak to her manager. I waited for another 30 minutes for the Manager who was very understanding.

He told me to try fill the form at the boarding gate or when I get home. I then went back to the check-in desk and the lady started addressing me very rudely. I was taken a back!. I told her that Iam sure she would not be treating me like this if I was a white man/woman.

"Usually Ethiopian airlines fly Boeging 787 Dreamliner or sometimes Boreing 777 for Addis Ababa- Lilongwe-Lubumbashi route, but recently it also flies older Boeing 737-800. The flight was packed full, boarding process was not well managed and chaotic with double bookings/assignments, and many passengers did not have their checked in luggages on arrival, because they could not be loaded to the airplane and were left in Addis airport. Even priority luggages and those of passengers boarding fresh from Addis (as opposed to transfer) were not carried. Economy class seat pitch looked extremely tight, too. If at all possible, I would suggest avoiding Boeging 737-800. Boreing 787, 777 as well as Airbus 350 have much larger cargo space and much more comfortable to travel. t is good to see passengers are coming back, but Ethiopian airlines seemed to be struggling to keep up the level of service delivery.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eagle32016,eagle32016 wrote a review Jun 2022,eagle32016,"New York City, New York",104 contributions,52 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Lilongwe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r842319265-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Boeing 737-800: Overcrowded and Chaotic Boarding, Priority luggages left behind",Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Their online booking system is deliberately designed so they can charge your creditcard while you never received any booking information. The seats you booked can then be sold again to someone else since you will have booked with another airline company in the knowledge that your booking attempt with Ethiopian Airlines failed. Basically it is a simple scam so when you filled in all details and your creditcard information the booking application(does not matter if you use Firefox, Chrome or any other browser, it is not clientbased) freezes.

Avoid at all costs!!!!! These people are impossible to contact when issues arise….. and the will arise! It’s not a legal requirement to have a visa travelling from Namibia to the UK but this airline take it upon themselves to change the rules and the law. Airport representatives brought my friend to tears and wouldn’t explain why she couldn’t fly. These people charged a huge amount to cancel the ticket. We will fly with a reputable company in future. Lesson learned. Absolutely shocking that this company is still allowed to operate!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiehD6344MH,Katie H wrote a review May 2022,Katie H,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",6 contributions,4 helpful votes,Windhoek - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r840673020-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Katie Hook,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"4 of us reached Cape Town Airport early at 10.30am on Saturday, 30th April, 2022 so that we could catch our return flight (2.35pm) back to Mumbai via Addis Ababa.

The check in staff demanded if we had done the RT-PCR Test & filled Air Suvidha Form as required by Indian Govt.

As we had not, they refused to check in our Baggage.

We were unaware of this procedure as Online Check-In was done a day earlier via Ethiopian Airlines website.

No Reports were asked during the Online Check In Procedure.

Also we could have taken the express RT-PCR Test in Cape Town Airport so that we could catch the flight back which was not known by us.

The Ethiopian Airlines staff was Rude & Curt and refused to tell us anything.

Till the Flight for Addis Ababa took off, they did not listen to a word we said & then cancelled our Return Flight with the reason : No Show (Even though we were standing right opposite the Check In counter).

As per Airline Rules, they needed to rebook 4 of us on the next available flight to Addis Ababa & onward to Mumbai. (Monday, 2nd May.,2022.)

We tried contacting Ryan Rocha, Sales Manager Passenger, Ethiopian Airlines,
104 Windfall, Sahar Plaza Complex , Andheri Kurla Road,Andheri East, Mumbai 400059

Tel: +91-22-28395468.

But there was no response or the phone no. did not exist.

We visited South Africa for a Rotary Friendship Exchange program & not a Tourist visit & the SA Visa was expiring in 3 days.

We went to the Medical centre @Cape Town Airport for RT-PCR Tests & paid ZAR 2000 for 4Pax.

The reports were sent to our email within 24 hours.

We had to book a hotel & pay USD 250+ for 2 days stay.

Uploaded the RT-PCR reports on Air Suvidha Website of Indian Govt on 1st May,2022.

Imagine our surprise when we reached the Airport at 10.30 am on 2nd May, 2022.

The check-in Staff asked us to purchase our Return Flight tickets again for ZAR 12,440 (About USD 840) which we had no choice but do as demanded.

This is the worst experience faced by me in my 50 years flying on different Airlines all over the world.
I will be posting this in Rotary Club magazine also.

If they value Rotary International business in the future, they should refund the amount extorted from our group for Return flights to MUMBAI (CPT-ADD-BOM).

It was their duty to have informed us about the RT-PCR Report in advance before confirming the online Check In.

People should think twice before using Ethiopian Airlines as they are bullies who give low fares but charge extra the moment there is some issue.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/39/1b/69/basco4u.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/basco4u,basco4u wrote a review May 2022,basco4u,"Mumbai, India",86 contributions,15 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r838791397-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,One of the Worst Airlines I have ever traveled in the Last 50 Years,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Words cannot begin to describe what Ethiopian Airlines put me through in last two weeks. On Business trip arrive Saturday morning 06:30 only to find out bags did not arrive on same flight. Was told that bag had been located and would be with me in 24 hours. 3 hours later leave Heathrow with ZERO compensation or travel kit to get through the 24 hours.

What happens next 120 hours of Ethiopian Airlines call centers disgusting service, sending me from pillar to post and pushing blame to their baggage handlers. Dozens of dropped calls and staff putting phone down in my face.

Dir. of operations Mr. Michael Yohannes who's contact details are shared but after initial contact flat out ignoring phone calls and WhatsApp messages refusing to take control of situation. Bags finally arrived 5 days later half way through my trip. Emails sent to Ethiopian Airlines to claim for incidentals totally ignored still to this day.

To add insult to injury return flight. Check-in system malfunction and some passengers including myself despite having boarding passes and able to check-in not able to board due to them not being able to check bags on the plane manually due to security procedures. Understandable.

21:00 in the evening on a Friday night. Ground staff contingency plan is to tell everyone who is trying to get home to go home in a foreign County. No offer for hotel accommodation or guidance in the matter. Staff main focus was getting themselves home as gate was closed.

This company has tested my resolve now and it will not go unchallenged. The mere fact that this is the level of service afforded customers when it comes to these incidents is proof that Ethiopian Airlines has ever been challenged previously by their customers. Not this one.

Have instructed lawyers to start criminal procedures and charges will be laid against Ethiopian Airlines for lost opportunity and emotional stress.

"I am an avid traveler both for work and pleasure. This is my first time taking Ethiopian Airlines and it will be my last. I was in business class and when I got on the flight, there was someone in my seat because the flight attendant had asked her to sit on my seat so she can be next to her bf. I was not asked if that was OK. I was moved to another seat and a few minutes later the passenger of that seat arrived and I had to be moved yet again. The discrimination inflight was glaring with Ethiopian nationals being attended to courteously.  I paid $5k+ for this flight and this will be my last time.

"the best airline in Africa, no doubt, but far behind the middle eastern airlines!The feel of the cabin is inferior to Emirates or Qatar. One feels this in the quality of the Duvet, slippers, and the vanity bag, as well as the headphones.  The WORST experience is the POOR check-in PROCESS. One of the main reasons for paying for Business Class tickets is not having to cue.  The check-in was slow for both check-in on departure and return.  Business-class passengers should be prioritsed.In addition, there should be a  BAG drop of cue - what's the point of checking in online if you still have to stand with everyone and wait, simply to drop  off your bag?

They dint have enough blankets/covers,
The blankets where stored on the luggage lockers above seat 29,and the passenger where just picking and issuing themselves when the flight attendants noticed they started disturbing to everyone randomly from seat 29 and issued to everyone except my seat 30j and the passenger seating next to me, which was unbelievable because we where just next to them.. I really don't want to even imagine the reason for these. Plus the CA in was freezing the entire trip was soo cold.
Am sure they are aware of the number of passengers in the flight and should have the right number of covers/blankets for each passenger.
The plane had a damaged head rest seat 28L even had to move the pass gers to different seat, terrible experience not just for me.

On my connection flight from addis ababa to Nairobi there was a lady who dint even have any meal or drink as the fold able ts ke was broken all they did was sa sorry to her I don't remember the seat but I was seated in seat number 11L she was in the 1st raw in the middle..

The local manager in Ireland then got things rolling. Then, they immediately refunded our tickets to a bank account that is closed while we told them to not send the money there. Now we are still waiting for our money since it's taking them forever to check where the money is now and it's just so hard to get a hold of people... If I hadn't get help from the local manager in Ireland things would have been even worse. I would never ever ever book with this airline again. We spent 1500 euros on flights we couldn't use due to COVID and two years later we are still trying to get our money back while we are legally entitled to get it back... Very poor communication. They knew the card we paid the tickets with was cancelled but still they didn't bother sending the money to our new account....

So anyone who has your card information can charge you at anytime they get the opportunity. I have been trying to get them fix this but they chose to tell me they didn’t charge me dispute sending them proves of my bank statements and all.

"I rarely leave any review, but I have to leave one for Ethiopian Airlines.

We'd booked a flight to fly out from SP to BA on the 12th of March 2022, however, due to unforeseen delay by another airline we had to change the said flight to the 14th March.

We had paid for the fee to change the tickets on the website and it showed us the new booking date and time upon payment, so we thought everything is fine. However, we did not receive any confirmation email and we couldn't find any booking under the original booking number.

When we called customer support, nobody was able to provide a solution and kept delaying our requests... they first said that there's no existing booking and then later asked us to pay for ""no show fee"". If there was no existing booking, why again do we have to pay for the ""no show fee""?

We felt like the Airline is constantly trying to rip us off by asking for 1) expensive changing fee, THEN 2) no show fee (why would we pay for no show when we clearly would not show up hence we paid to change the flight?), 3) constant threatening by saying ""prices"" are subject to change any minute in the customer support email, asking for our credit card details!

Dear Ethiopian Airlines, your customers deserved better customer support and explanation.

My advice is if you're like me and you just want an airline that can deliver a simple service of flying you from point A to B, do not choose Ethiopian Airlines. Because they can be your worst nightmare.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954nikkiy,Nikki Y wrote a review Mar 2022,Nikki Y,,4 contributions,3 helpful votes,Sao Paulo - Buenos Aires,South America,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r831053769-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The Worst Airline Experience Ever,Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight was from Sao Paulo (BRAZIL) to Goma (DRC) and therefore there is a stop over at Adis Abbaba.
Since the stop over was more than 12 hours, Ethiopian has to offer accomodations.
The company brought us to a neraly abandoned hotel, called Washington.
The first room was not cleaned at all, a complete mess. The reception apologized and changed to another one.
The second one was also old, but the main issue was the room key did not open the room.
Their solution was whenever I would enter the room, I should go to the reception and the manager would follow me with the master key....
Apart from that, the meal experience was not in the same level of the flight meal.
There is no menu, no information of what the food is, vegetarian, meat ?
Diferent from the flight, there was only water in the dinner.
In a whole, the overnight at that hotel offered by Ethiopian was a very bad experience for a more than U$ 1300,00 ticket.
I asked for an update to the Skylight Hotel, wich is also operated by the Ethiopian.

"I purchased a ticket in the United States for my son to join me on holiday.  When I purchased the ticket the day before, the airline sent me an email, in the middle of the night, asking me for all sorts of documentation to verify the ticket purchase.  My son was waiting at the airport for the approval.  I reached out and the person that sent the email was out for the day and there was no way the approval was going to happen before the flight departed.  So we purchased another ticket while he was at the airport.  Needless to say, Ethiopian Airlines went ahead and charges the original ticket, a day after the flight left.  I sked to seek out my local Ethiopian Airline center in the US; there is no one working at that center in Washington DC as all calls are forwarded to international call center.

Stylish and efficient Ethiopian - simply the best
Triumphing magnificently conquered the the skies.

Huge African rainbow shines above
Its nearest - the mountain Semien
Gloriously reflecting colours of heritage and nature.

Tourists and hospitable people keep on joining together
Staring at the amazing spectacles - past becoming clearer
Admiring them all with happy and smiling faces
Even lions joyfully roar harmoniously down below
Love for Ethiopian sinks deeper but smoothly goes slow!

All stretched their hands upwards - future to be brighter
Also situation of the World - to become much better.

"Writing again here thanking the airlines gives me a great pleasure.  A poem will follow in admiration of the staff and crews.  Indeed, as I said below, it was so great to fly with Ethiopian on the eve and early morning of the New Year of 2022.  The staff and crew were kind, helpful and caring.  In particular, I remain grateful to Mr. Alemu Dubiesa Hieye, the super-manager in Asmara, for his kindness and co-operation in helping me get in the plane, literally, just a few minutes before the plane took-off to Addis.  I must say that I arrived in the airport in Asmara so late as it was difficult for me to get the corona form completed there.  Mr. Alemu is definitely my super-hero for 2022 because he made it possible for me to travel to London happily.The staff and crews go all the way to help and please their passengers.  Ethiopian became best airlines twice recently - that is for 2020 and 2021.  I think their kindness and co-operation might have been one of the many reasons which helped it to win the hearts of its passengers.  Well done!

"On June 12, 2021, I purchased a roundtrip ticket on Ethiopian Airlines On June 29, 2021, I learned that one of my connections on American Airlines to Paris was canceled but I had the option of going to London and catching Ethiopian Airlines from there. I called the Ethiopian Airlines call-center number, Facebook, and finally reached someone directly from their webpage. This CSA advised me to purchase another ticket - a one-way from London. He explained that once the second purchase was in the system, Ethiopian Airlines would then combine both reservations and issue me a refund. On June 30, 2021, I called back to inquire about the price adjustment/refund as the agent had indicated as well as make sure my return was still valid. It took several calls. Each agent said the information I was originally given was wrong and he should have simply changed my departure city. However, a supervisor would have to review the audiotapes of our conversation before issuing the refund. I kept calling and being told to wait until the tapes were reviewed. I even reached out to Ethiopian Airlines via Twitter.   On my return from my trip, I attempted to reach out to Ethiopian Airlines several times to no avail. I tried to dispute the charges with my credit card but ET told them I had used both tickets and the credit card company declined to make any further investigations. On August 23/24, I reached out to ET via a reservation email I found online as well as some manager emails I found online. On August 25, one of the managers responded, adding the US customer service team and asking that they provide assistance. The response I finally received from customer service on 07 September states that both tickets are on used status.

Absolutely dreadful treatment. I paid £1122 to fly from UK to Zimbabwe in December and the Omicron crisis happened so UK Gov introduced quarantine. I had to cancel. They gave me £847 back. In the weeks since I have been messed around and pushed from pillar to post. In the end they refuse to give me the remaining £275 claiming I had to pay a £150 cancellation fee and the money paid for legroom seats is not refundable.

"Customers Beware! There is no Customer Service.

If you happen to chat online with CS, they would tell you they would email you but that is just their way of getting off the char or the phone. Due to this poor service,  I was stranded in an airport for more than 24 hrs after the CS Rep confirmed that EA would accommodate me for my delayed flight, With no help from the EA after several attempts to contact them via phone/email, I was forced to spend the night at the Airport.

Nobody replies to emails, chatboot is asking just to provide the info and no real reply. Finally after 4 days trying to reschedule anyone I visited the office. They asked me to pay 900USD to change the ticket for a flight departing 1 day later that J should take and they cancelled! Unbelievable.

"Travelling these days is really an ordeal and there are many challenges that you have to surpass.
Lately, my selection of airlines narrowed down to 2 airlines.
One of the best airline I can take is the Ethiopia Airlines (at least from where I am travelling). This is because of the large fleet they have.
The setbacks are:
- their website is very unreliable
- the flights are always moved or cancelled
- the check-in is not that convenient
- the services are very poor.

"What a night mare of a trip both to and from. First of all the staff are extremely rude and unprofessional. From Check-in to Ethiopian airport staff At Addis Ababa airport.

The planes and the seats don’t have working tv controls, the air hostess are too rough in that during drink and meal time, they keep dropping drinks on those sat next to them or dropping cups on to them, without even apologising, they won’t provide wipes for hand washing even on request, in the middle of a pandemic, they won’t even supply blankets overnight and they disappear after you ask for one.

At the airport for black Africans customers have to pay for everything in cash while white/Caucasian customers are allowed to pay using their Visa cards and the staff are extremely rude and unethical.

Make sure u take very small hand luggage otherwise at the plane entry point they will make you thier own rip off project with an excuse of your suitcase wheels being too big, they asked for £190 simply because of the wheels not fitting into thier box, they will keep shouting at you at the same time so that you don’t get time to think, resulting into them robbing you.

"We were informed to be at the Johannesburg Airport 5 hours before flying time by Ethiopian Airways, they only opened counters 3 & 1/2 hours before flying time, changed counters twice and it was absolute chaos. No social distancing. Boarding time was met with similar chaos - even with boarding zones clearly stipulated it was pushing and shoving to get to the front. On board the chaos continued as the flight was apparently ""overbooked"" and people were moved from one seat to another. On-board staff was very friendly and tried their best but by then most people were fed-up. Economy seats are extremely uncomfortable and having flown with various airlines before this is probably poorest seat quality we have experienced. In our group of 4 we had one traveler that found entertainment screen out of order on the outbound flight and one on the inbound flight. Transit in Addis Ababa seemed better organised but the airport is a rip-off with a coffee (in a take-away cup) at 5USD and a Beer between 6USD and 10USD. Also no social distancing when boarding. Planes are not cleaned or sanitised in change overs and both flights from and to Addis Ababa to Zanzibar we had to clean and spray ourselves.  Whilst the tickets was the cheapest, I would not recommend the airline and if possible not use them again.  You can put in bid for upgrade to business class that seems a bit cheaper (if successful)  than buying Business Class outright but I am not sure it will make it better as the expectations against price is then much higher and many of the problems were not flying class related.

"Check in in Johannesburg - 1 hour to check in and arrived 4 hours before the departure time because only had 2 check in agents for a full flight.
Boarding - was chaotic as we were not boarded by zones.
Covid regulations - everyone wore masks but we were never socially distanced throughout from check in to boarding to disembarkation.
Dreamliner 787 aircraft type - seats are very narrow and quite threadbare - very uncomfortable, leg room was adequate.
Type of meals - served a dinner only and was very small portions - a basic salad, a basic dessert and a small foil wrapped main course.
Drinks and tea and coffee was only served with the meal. No water service throughout the flight although you could request it.
Meal service from delivery to clearing took over an hour.
Duration of flight - 4.5 hours , left at 11.30pm so very difficult to sleep on this flight.
In flight entertainment system - not the latest movies, very poor selection, head sets were of very poor quality, I would recommend to bring your own movies and play them through the system and bring your own headphones.
Toilets were clean and kept clean throughout the flight.

"Travel is not easy at the moment, but having made the journey to Heathrow from my home in Kenya three weeks ago I was well prepared.  I am writing this as I sit in Moi Airport. I traveled business class with KQ but decided to give Ethiopian Airlines  chance in economy. First disappointment is that you can’t check in online from Mombasa. You can with KQ. Second disappointment was that I was asked for ‘proof of payment’ of my day2 PCR test in UK. The confirmation code was on my PLF but she would not accept that!!  I had to find a confirmation email!!!

"It is a shame. They denied me boarding to South Africa, it was over two hours discussion at the check in counter with very rude and inexperienced staff of Ethiopian airlines. Horrible customer support. I am German passport holder and had all requirements for entry to South Africa incl. onward ticket to Namibia. They wanted me to purchase mandatory a return flight with Ethiopian airlines … it’s unbelievable. Otherwise I get denied boarding. Never ever happened to me something like this in my life before, have been to over 87 counties in the world and flew 180+ airlines.

Please boycotte this airline, they should not be accepted for such a corrupt way. In the end I needed to sign an own responsibility report for any border deny at the South African boarder. How the story ended? It was the smoothest border entry in Johannesburg and they were totally fine with my onward ticket to Namibia as stated on the government website and ambessy.

Thank you Ethiopian for such a horrible experience. Never ever again!!

No one picked up the phones so I had to send 28 emails to finally get a response to be told “fly back when it comes off the red list then” they refused point blank to give me a refund, so I reversed the charge via my bank and got ALL my money back.

"We bought through Mytrip and with Ethiopian Airlines two round-trip tickets from Montevideo to Bangkok in the month of November 2021, a few days after making the purchase and already debited the payment through VISA, they inform us that they canceled the tickets , this notification came to us via text mail. We quickly contacted the agency in question to generate the refund of the money since they proposed to manage it, the days passed and we did not receive any more responses or the money for the purchase. We are communicating directly with the airline that so far we have not received a satisfactory answer either.
The contact number that Mytrip sends to communicate with you is from Mexico and is not active.

"A horrible experience with the airline they do not allow you to book meals online when I call reservations they had no idea how to do it. They give me an answer to say call 24 hours before departure while the rules on the website says you must book it 72 hours in advance.
They were very in unhelpful when I asked them about Covid travel requirements on their airline as UK does not require any testing anymore reservations said our website is not been updated so you need to get testing done regardless of what the rules for the country are. They don’t know when they’ll update the website until they update the website you have to follow their rules rather than the countries rules.

I called again and they told me I don’t need testing. Luckily I did the test anyway and at the airport half the people will let go without any tests and a half the people were being harassed by the airline asking them for tests and none of the staff seem to know the rules.

Watch out at Addis airport they try and continue cup of coffee or tea is US$5 the most expensive I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world.
I tried to buy four bars of chocolate and was told US$9 but the lady at the counter kid in US$20 on the card machine in local currency is there no tourists do not check.
When I confronted them as I had a message on my phone with the amount they tried to make up an excuse that all of a sudden $9 was adding up US$20 on a calculator that is US$5 for one bar of snickers
After a fight I got a refund of my money and bought it with cash one door from that store for US$1 so be careful they will try con you .

"I booked and paid for seats with extra leg room. $60. I did not get that seat. I got the normal seat you don't pay extra for. The woman at check in told me that I would be entitled to a refund and that I would just need to contact them after the flight. Return flight then had the plane changed so I didn't get my seat then either. Same story I was told that is would get a refund. I have now been contacting them for almost a year and they have decided I am not due my refund despite them changing my seat.
Not only that, when I boarded the plane there was no space for my hand luggage. So they took my bag down to checked luggage. When I arrived one staff went down to get my hand luggage as I had covid certificate in it. When I received the bag my phone was gone from the front pouch and the lock was broken. It was a samsonite new bag so not cheap and not weak. I have had ongoing issues with this company for several years tbh but always in a situation where they're the only airline at times flying between my work and home. From now on I will happily pay extra or wait longer to go with another airline rather than give them another penny. I hate thieves and scammers.

"I booked my return tickets from Johannesburg to Delhi via za.mytrip.com last year April for 2 people, reference number (L0JVZZ) , but flight got cancelled due to covid 19, I was given vouchers and was told that if I cancel my tickets after 1 year I would get full refund otherwise there will be a penalty deducted, I had to travel twice to India since that time but have not been able to use the vouchers as flights are still not operating. I have been asking for refund for long time, but za.mytrip.com refused to pay back now. It is so pathetic, feeling so frustrated and cheated. I am just trying to get my money back.

"#1: 7:25pm tonite, staff well aware I’m waiting for station manager to process my refund, no one told he arrived, I approached a new face, tells me he’s there a while. Why have me wait? Why doesn’t staff know refund process is by email. Why do they say only he can process it?? Ethiopian airlines Jfk terminal 8, statin managers name is Teka Million. He gave me the email address, says process is about 2weeks I should hear back. I asked him if this airline is playing around and will I get my refund? They have me running in circles and I feel like they’re playing games and I won’t get my money back. It feels like a scam. I was told by phone rep back in Aug when I had to cancel, to go in person. Teka says process since Covid isn’t by email. No one is on same page. Wasting my time going to airport twice now, paying parking fees for nothing.

It’s a very shady process and poor communication. I haven’t been able to speak with a phone rep since the date I cancelled, they don’t pick up, wait on hold for a while for nothing, call to airline, says send us an email or leave your number for a call back. I did both Monday 9/20/21 and still no response from them.

"Flying for the first time in Ethiopian Airlines from London to Maputo via Addis Ababa was not my idea of an enjoyable flight, but the moment I got on board, wow, that beautiful smile of the air hostess and the welcome on board message from the senior staff said it all.
Half way to Addis Ababa and after the wonderful experience of excellent food, onboard service and hospitality, I decided that in future this is the airline for me.
Next I flew from Maputo to Manila, and then from Maputo to Delhi all via Addis Ababa by Ethiopian and believe me the experience is incredible. Their transit lounge is as good as any top airport lounge in the world.
Who says that Airlines based in Africa are not as good as any other airlines in the world ? For me Ethiopian is the best and if I can help it and if they fly to where I want to travel, then Ethiopian is for me. Now, in the future and ever after.

"I had a return ticket from Douala Cameroon to UAE scheduled on 4th September 2021 at 2:00pm. I arrived the airport at 12:10 noon, but was stopped from checking in with the excuse that I came late. Approximately 50 people were there who had to fly but were given the same reason. I had to pay a sim of 182500 frs to rebook another ticket for the next day 5th September 2021. The flight for the 5 th had to take off at 12:45 pm. To my greatest surprise, check in on this day was accepted till 12:00pm. Many passengers who had to travel on the 4th incurred extra charges and I believe the management at Douala know what they did. I don’t see why we were refused to check in while we came 1:50 minutes before the flight time and the next day, people who came 45 minutes to the flight time were accepted.
I urge the management of Ethiopian airlines to investigate this and get back to all those who were affected on this day (4th September at Douala). While waiting for your immediate action, I might still be your customer, but know that if no investigations are carried out, Ethiopian airlines might loose close to or more than 50 customers who were affected on this day for no just course.

"My review is not valid for in flight service, as my flight was cancelled / delayed. It relates to ticket sales conditions. I have given a 4/5 rating for all services I am not justified to answer because I did not fly.
I was booked to depart from Dar-es-Salaam at 4:45pm on 2nd Aug 2021, and then connect in Addis Ababa the following day 3rd August for the flight to Victoria Falls. Ethiopian then emailed me to say that my flight would now depart on 4th August - 2 days later - apologizing for any inconvenience caused, but not offering me an option to accept or cancel.
I decided to buy another ticket on a different airline and ask for a refund. When I asked for a refund they stated that their terms state that any cancellation will be charged $200. This surprised me because in essence I had not cancelled a flight that I had booked. They had given me a different service - 2 days later, and I had refused that change.

SO I strongly advise anyone to buy their ticket with Ethiopian LAST MINUTE, when they know the flight will happen, rather than risk losing $200 for the privilege of booking early.
Covid requirements have made planning flights extremely difficult, and this is made changes expensive when airlines change flight times /days and cannot refund you, even though they cannot deliver as booked. Alternatively if you have to buy early, buy insurance that covers cancellation, and let the insurers recover the difference.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/bd/ba/09/kengele.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kengele,Kengele wrote a review Sep 2021,Kengele,"Jaca, Aragon, Spain",267 contributions,58 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Victoria Falls,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r807854198-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Ethiopian changed the departure to 2 days later, then charged me to cancel the booking",Date of travel: August 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"being a repeat customer of air Ethiopian I have never felt so ripped off as I was when I decided to open my ticket due to personal issues, it all started when I called the Nairobi office to see if I can reschedule my ticket because of some personal issues I couldn't travel on the agreed date on the ticket.
one lady who sounded very helpful answered my call. I explained my reasons why I couldn't travel on the agreed date and that I wanted to reschedule to a later date and how much it would cost me.
that's when the con game started, she advised me to just open the ticket and I can book it any time I am ready to travel,
I asked her will there be any charges she said no we don't charge any charges for opening tickets she magically forgot to tell me when your re-booking you may be required to add some cash depending on the current rates. which I would be okay with if I was informed.
came the day of re-booking that's when the con game was at play. I called the Ethiopian airlines office in Nairobi told them I want to re-book.
the same lady picked the phoned I explained myself to her the tone changed now I was officially a bait, she said currently we are busy let me see if I can find you a seat as we are fully booked for the next two days I pleaded with her not knowing I was digging my own grave.
she put me on hold for like ten minutes came back to me saying I have to pay 358 dollars if I wanted a seat on the next available flight. remember I paid 544.51 dollars for the return flight .but now I am being told to pay 358 dollars additional fee.
at this time she knew I was desperate to get back to work I had to play to the con game.
so basically I paid for my return flight which I just wanted to be rescheduled
the saddest part is that the day of the flight we flew with some empty seats from NAIRO-ADDIS /ADDID -DXB.
i mean I understand the re-booking fee but three-quarters of the initial amount for a one route flight,
but i have learned my lesson I used to hold Ethiopian Airlines in high regard but sadly I had to swallow the bitter pill..thank you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddyabua,eddyabu a wrote a review Sep 2021,eddyabu a,,1 contribution,,Nairobi - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r807666156-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,RE-BOOKING RIP OFF,Date of travel: August 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was served as ""mixed vegetables"" in business class. The food had a white film. When I asked the stewardess what kind of vegetable was on my fork she said it ""broccoli"". I refused to eat the rotting, mushy food.

The stewardess only offered chicken or beef when I ordered food. Thank goodness I overheard her conversation with another passenger cuz I found out fish is also an option.

I sat quietly watching movies for one of Ethiopians 7hr flights. Over a few hours I ordered some wine. As the stewardess poured my 3rd glass she said ""you can have one more"". I was completely shocked seeing how I was disturbing nobody and I was having less than one glass an hour.

Sometimes i believe that this sector from malabo to mumbai via addis is a neglected sector as its not touching USA or UK or Australsia or Europe. So for Ethiopian airways this is low catagory.

"It was a very stressful and costly experience to have had our bag lost and no effort was made to compensate, whatsoever. Whilst were relieved that the bag finally turned up 3weeks later with our continued pressing, it took a great toll on us. When we tried to claim the $75 incidental payment mentioned on their website as part of their commitment to customers in such distress, thei response was to say ""you checked in 2 bags and since we delivered 1, Ethiopian airlines won't pay anything"". This is despite our desperate pleas for the bag to be located as it had all of the clothes of one of our children. The locked bag was opened in Addis and would've been seen to evidently contain the clothes as listed.

So in the 3weeks that the bag was missing, we were forced to spend money on our child's clothes, on following up through calls, emails and visiting their offices, and eventually more spent on going to the m Airport to pick up the bag and absolutely no token of compensation for the costs, inconveniences, stress and lost sleep incurred at their expense.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rumbilisa,RumbiLisa wrote a review Aug 2021,RumbiLisa,"Gland, Switzerland",2 contributions,7 helpful votes,Canton of Geneva - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r803244707-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Terrible with Lost Baggage,Date of travel: July 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"i was very anxious and worried after reading all the bad and horrible experiences from  passenger reviews about Ethiopian airlines . But lo and behold i experienced a super fantastic flight. My 1st leg of the trip was from Accra to Washington  Dulles via Addis. The flight was very prompt and smooth. Inflight service was good,entertainment was ok (except less variety). Food was delicious and drinks kept coming in hourly intervals . My connection from Addis to Washington was smooth and again in-service   was excellent. cabin crew were very friendly  and courteous. My return trip was the big test ,cause of my plenty luggage . I got all my luggage intact and in good condition. The flying experience was also very smooth with perfect landing and takeoffs.

"Flight out of Kilimanjaro was 3 hours late in leaving.
Connecting flight out of Addis in Ethiopia was over 12 hours delayed. Yes, that is not a typo. It was over 12 hours.
The staff kept telling passengers that they will board the next hour all because they wanted to stall the passengers so they did not have to pay for a hotel for them to sleep in as they did not have an airplane to fly in.
They then said it was due to the weather but countless other planes were arriving and departing on time, so ""weather"" was just a lie.
The airline did nothing to help with connecting flights which were missed due to their delays so we had to pay for new connecting flight tickets

"I have travelled many times with Ethiopian and they have a constant bad/low quality. You never know if you will travel with an old plane without screens and shabby seats. The staff serve you one meal. After that you never see them during the flight. They don't stroll down the isles to check if everyone is ok or someone needs a juice. The blankets are so old and used so they are paper thin.

Today our plane couldn't land in Addis due to bad weather. Instead they flew to Sudan and we had to wait for a couple of hours before we could go back to Addis. When we arrived to Addis I asked all the staff for help. Noone knew that our plane was still waiting and could tell us that. So we missed the plane because they have absolutely no organisation.

"3 July 2021 I took off from Lusaka, heading to Addis. We had an en-route stop at Harare for gas and a few people. Clear day, unlimited vis. Pilot shot a missed approach. Pilot got it right the second time. Upon landing the pilot announced the missed approach was not his fault, but a power outage at Harare Airport (no back up power present). They Harare Airport got the power back and he  landed the aircraft the second time. The pilot then announced, once we'd landed, that we would be delayed further because power went out again and all on-boarding needed to be done by hand (one hour delay). The pilot then announced a further delay, as an airliner landing on our departure runway came in hard, blowing multiple tires (There were no recovery vehicles at airport and it was Saturday afternoon). When we eventually made it into the air, pilot announced that people would be on the ground in Addis to expedite our now late/missed connections. Guess what didn't happen? To add insult to injury, i was yelled at by Ethiopian Airlines gate personnel, as I was the last person on my flight to Chicago. it was pretty clear that no notification was made to anyone at Addis. I have since called Ethiopian Airlines and have not received a call back. Attempts to complain on the Ethiopian Airlines Website have been met with 404 Error Codes.

"My daughter was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Madagascar, who intended to take a short trip home just prior to the pandemic.

During the process, Ethiopian offered little to no support to my daughter while on the ground in Madagascar. Nevertheless she returned home. Upon her return, we spent the next YEAR AND A HALF trying to negotiate a refund for her flight.

"I had a flight from lilongwe (Malawi) to Sharm El Sheikh (egypt) with connections at Addis Ababa, and Cairo on the 22nd May.

I was refused boarding on the connecting flight from Addias Ababa to Cairo after a 7hour layover as my yellow fever ticket was in my checked-in bag... Very rude staff who just blank refused to explain the situation and had me stand at the side while the whole plane boarded untill they told me the reason why I would not be getting on the flight! Wow, ok. When I asked about my bag they said, we will removed it.

OK, where will it go please?

Go, go, go, move, move!! Was the response I got.

Again I asked' please can you tell me where my bag will go?

Down there!! Go, go!! Physically pushes me out of the way..

Down where I asked?

To the office, down there go!! Points furiously down the terminal...

So at around 4am I walked the length of the entire airport to find this unknown office. I eventually found it around 4.30am and was met by 4 people in a room, 2 of which had their feet on the tables sat back in their chairs, obviously very busy people.

Hello, I've been refused boarding and I've been told here to come to collect my bag.

Come back at 7am was the response!! No explination as to why? Errrmmm, ok, why at 7am, my bag has been off loaded and I'd like it back asap please.

Go, go, go, wait, sit, wait... Man stands up and walks straight at me moving me out of the door... 7am you come back!!

I returned at 7am to be met with the same obnoxious and unhelpful attitude from every member of staff I had the displeasure of interacting with for the past 10hrs. A whooping 8hrs later, after been consistently lied to and fobbed off I was finally escorted outside the terminal to retrieve my yellow fever ticket from my bag. At least now I could now get out of this hell hole!

I needed my bag tho, I needed to now re-book a flight and re-check in the bag. I tried to take it but security aggressively stopped me. I was told to book a flight and take the confirmation email to the transit office where they would update their system, issue and attach a new baggage ticket to my bag.

So this is exactly what I did. I was assured by 3 different staff that my bag would arrive safely at my final destination.

Hello, Sharm El Sheikh (24th May) Guess what!! My bag never made it. Omg! I went to the office and a very polite man made an offical report and preceeded to called Addis Adaba airport. About an hour later I'm told there's no bag matching the description or baggage number in Addis Ababa airports system! Wtaf!! You must be kidding... How does this even happen??

From here I spent literally days and days making phone calls and sending emails... Every single one of the umpteen people I spoke to was about as helpful as a rotting slug.. I went round and round in circles.. No one cares... You can blatantly see this when your physically in Addis Ababa Airport... Hundreds of staff with not an iota of customer orientated focus. I'm amazed the are a 'star alliance' member.

I'd spent 3 days in the same clothes, 1 of them in Addis Ababa airport and arrived to a 38 degree heat country with literally nothing other than what I had on, my wallet, passport and phone. I had to replace my missing clothes, shoes, toiletries, bag etc at great expense. I was sure my bag was completely lost as no one could give me any information at all!

1st June... I recieved a WhatsApp message from a random number. There's a picture of my bag and a message saying, bag at sharm el sheik airport now.

Miracles do happen apparently! I actually got my bag back, contents all present and correct. Awesome!! Problem is I've spent a lot of money replacing it all thinking I would never get it back.

Sorry for the huuuge rant... but you really should think twice about using this airline/ Addis Ababa airport. I know 110% I'll never use them again.... Ever! Not just because they lost my bag and didn't care, but because I've never experienced such shockingly bad customer service and appauling attitudes by each and every member of staff I encountered...and I've been travelling the world since 2019!

"They are terrible, ignorant and irresponsible.
I bought a ticket from their official website site From Helsinki to Addis ababa mid of March 2021 for April 30 flight. They provided me SAS as connection flight from Helsinki to Stockholm and ET from Stockholm to Addis.
At the day when I arrive to airport I told by Finnair worker that SAS has stopped operating long time back and I am not the only one who is cheated.
When I tried to contact them it was impossible.
I finally got someone in Sweden who worked for ET he ignorantly told me buy a new ticket and you can ask for refund which is obviously what some one can do when there is no option.
I tried to reach so called areal manager she didn't even reply call and when I emailed her with all the documents she just ignored it.
I have no option than to buy new tickets by myself.

"I have always loved the airline and as it was efficient and cost effective. However last year I experienced great difficulty with the airline but wrote it off as a covid thing. I bought a return ticket from DXB to SA. I had to move my date sooner as the airport was closing. The airline wanted to charge me as a result knowing they won’t be able to operate flights on my initial date of departure. I eventually manage to change the book and had to leave that same day. I upgraded to business class and the service was non existent, Iv had way better experiences in economy. I then couldn’t leave South Africa due to the lockdown and I was told I could apply for a refund or change the date. I lost my job and had no reason to return to Dubai so I applied for the refund. After numerous emails back and forth I was told it’s not possible. This year I emailed them asking if I could rebook and they said yes however there is a ban on South Africa. I waited and watched news updates and was later informed by an online chat agent I could go ahead and book. I booked for today thinking the airline had new information and maybe the ban was lifted. I mean why else would I be advised to go ahead and book. They then wanted to charge me 75USD additionally. After explaining their own terms and conditions to them the booking was finally made. I then saw the ban was extended and tried to change the booking l, now they introduced more fees. My flight is leaving now and here I am sitting writing this review because I’m unable to cancel it, nor rebook it. I being charged a no show fee and rebooking fee of 125USD approximately. I have emailed so many different departments with no replies or responses. The reservations time reply, however it’s like I’m emailing robots with only limited responses so all they do is copy and paste information. I don’t mind the fees however I’m forced to believe that they do not care about their clients only about making money for the airline. I was wrongly advised and when I asked I was either ignored or given dilutive
Information.

One male particular staff at the Boarding approached me and my puppy while waiting for the Gate to Open i have been in that area for the past 3-4 Hours..this person approached very closely asking from where i am coming from and created a new rule from today no dogs are allowed in Cabin flight and then requested her documents and so on, my puppy sensed the tension with this guy so each time he was approaching me, she barked at him which is normal behavior then he started to act if my puppy is a monster and need to put a muzzle on her mouth.
Anyways, when we went and submit the boarding pass, when i reached his colleague who was him at the time he approached got scared and i confirmed to her she was only barking at him and what happened to my surprise the guy had left the boarding with lots of people waiting in line to the plane before i arrive and which started the whole nightmare of the flight. When i reached the plane, the flight attendant when they saw my puppy made a big reaction “oh my god, that’s a dog” and the guy was standing in the middle, I didn’t bother i just asked where’s the seat direction and went ahead, never experienced such a reaction people overall had been approaching me all the time how cute ur puppy is, is it a she or a he, petting the puppy.
Anyways, this experience didn’t end up here, while we’re flying to our destination, the cabin crew females, not all of them thank god, each time passing by one will stop and ask why my dog mouth isn’t shut, this happened 4 times already in a flight of 2 Hours!!!!
In the end, i have responded “ I seriously don’t understand why everyone in this flight is picking on my dog and make it seem like a monster, why should i shut the mouth of my baby huh? You guys have been trying to create a new rule to not let my dog inside the flight and stating this is new law applicable from today like wow seriously who are you trying to fool, then how come i have paid the Ticket for my puppy before my 1st flight departure, the puppy is sitting in the pet carrier not making sound or anything, she’s just sitting peacefully so why the hell everyone on this flight is bullying us and treating her if she’s a monster, this is really the worst flight i have ever taken in my life and i have ended up crying in the plane like this is enough and i have made a decision that after all this years and due to the fact how we had been treated, i will stop being a loyal customer of Ethiopian Airlines
And i will never book with them ever Again, the last one had apologised on behalf of the whole team and confirmed to me i am allowed to fly with my dog in cabin, i informed yes i am aware of my rights and it’s not you who need to apologise on behalf of the rest of them team, they are the one who should be apologising and in terms of rules i have been checking the pet policy of course so i know the rules and for that reason i will submit an official complaint on these people for creating fake law to not allow me to fly with my puppy and for the bullying that had occurred along the flight”

I used to tell my friends about my experiences with this airlines and defending them, how much animal friendly they are but not anymore literally for me this airlines became the worst, and i will never going to recommend this airline for travelling with pets!
I hope people will get some punishment and learn a lesson for treating customers!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsiri,Bsiri wrote a review Mar 2021,Bsiri,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Beirut - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r785238500-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst Airline....never booking with them again!,Date of travel: March 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I departed for London from Cape Town with a valid corona test. Nobody stopped me from leaving the country. After arriving in Addis, I am told I may not board the plane to London as my COVID test has expired. The rule is that the test must be within 72 hours from departure. My test was valid and I was incorrectly stopped from boarding my plane.

The airline then took 3 hours to help us book a hotel and pay for a visa. We were issued hotel vouchers and when arriving at the shuttle, the driver tells us that the vouchers are invalid and that the airline has not paid for our accommodation, even though I have paid the airline. We have no way of contacting the staff inside. After another 2 hours, a lady comes outside and changes our vouchers for the panorama hotel.

When arriving at the Panorama hotel, the receptionist will not give me a room because I have no boarding pass. The reason I have no boarding pass is because your printing machine wasn’t working. It’s now 8am, and this ordeal started at 12:30pm the previous day.

The following day when trying to catch another flight to London, the check in staff prevent me from going to passport control and say it is illegal for me to enter the UK. I am a resident of the UK – what possible reason can there be for me being stopped from boarding this plane. Eventually with 20 minutes till the flight, I am let through and have to sprint to the boarding gate.

Finally, I arrive in London and my luggage is missing.

Its now been 6 weeks and Ethiopian have not responded to any of my queries or claims to be compensated for my cut open case or missing items.

Rather fly other airlines for a slight premium - it will save you the drama.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V5343VNgregm,Greg Meyer wrote a review Mar 2021,Greg Meyer,,5 contributions,6 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r784514666-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Horrific airline - avoid at all costs,Date of travel: February 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Recently went on a last minute trip from Dubai to Harare with this airline.

I am so very disappointed in the service given to their customers.

Upon my departure from Dubai I checked in a day before my flight to help ease the check in process at the airport. I had the necessary documents ready. When I reached the airport it was total CHAOS at check in. It felt like I was at a market place. I had asked the one attendee there if there was a line for online check in as I didn’t want to wait in line with so many people. There was no social distancing AT ALL!!! Complete chaos!! It took nearly 2 hours for me to stand in line and check in. Never in the history of my travels have I ever experienced this!
Time for boarding the plan, the plan was completely booked. No space to even breathe. I booked a premium seat in economy to have a little extra space. There were 2 women that sat in the seats next to me that were not assigned to those seats. Their bulky luggage at the feet flights attendants not really paying any attention at all.. breakfast was horrible. Had the option to choose between pancakes and eggs. Since I don’t eat eggs I vouched for the pancakes. Little did I know it was a CAKE!!!! With berry jam. Never touched it at all. When we got to the airport in Ethiopia there were exposed wires and construction going on. Not very safe for families traveling with kids..

The flight from Addis to Harare was ok.

Flight from Harare to Addis was fine. Less people. But when we got to the airport in Addis once again I felt so unsafe. So many people walking around without their masks. Toilets smelling like something died in there. So much over crowding!! I don’t understand. We are living in this pandemic and have witnessed daily on the news the thousands of people that are dying from this virus. Why aren’t there guards to ensure that everyone in the airport is wearing their masks!!! On the flight there were about 4 to 5 men walking around the plane without any masks on and I saw the attendants casually walking passed them without saying anything.

The flights attendants are also not really in to their jobs as they look so tired or fed up with everything.

Being a frequent flyer with emirates I was not able to book my flight with them and had to opt for Ethiopian airlines.

Please take this as constructive feedback to protect your staff and those of the passengers. This is a serious issue that really needs to addressed. This is a lovely airline and has so much potential but the negligence of the staff is not acceptable to me.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/67/0e/a9/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kei1993,Kvlahakis wrote a review Mar 2021,Kvlahakis,,15 contributions,15 helpful votes,Dubai - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r784410352-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,3 out of  10 experience,Date of travel: March 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The customer service of the Ethiopian airline at the Bole International airport is very poor, especially the Interline office department.  While on a flight to Korea, I was stopped in Addis because apparently the Alien card I normally used for traveling could not be used since I had been outside of Korea for over a year.  But the problem is that the Ethiopian airline officer in my initial departure place had said that the problem I had (getting a boarding pass from Addis to Seoul) would be fixed once in Addis, because they had confirmed with the Ethiopian airline in Bole International airport  , saying it was a system error.  But arriving there, I was treated like a criminal, my passport was also confiscated and I got it back home as I was deported.But the treatment was very bad;  there was also another pregnant lady who had a certain issue, and was mistreated.  Despite her being in agony, tired and the time being 2 am, they did not care to give her any care.  Later they said she would have a flight back to her home her her in 3 days time (Friday 12 March, the day was Wednesday 10th March).  Right now, she is probably still at the airport.  And she has not received any care.  They only said they would give her some meal coupons for meals at the airport.  But come on!  This is someone who is pregnant, the health of two people are concerned!  Stop treating people like animals !!  A generous Zimbabwean man tried to help her by giving her his her room her her in the platinum lounge.  But the staff refused.  And when that man asked the staff ""do you have a wife?""the other guy had the guts to say ""she is not the only pregnant woman travelling"".  I was shocked by this ""customer service!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmO9921LG,h m wrote a review Mar 2021,h m,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Niamey - Seoul,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r784399982-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Poor customer service at Bole International airport,Date of travel: March 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled to and from Lagos. The check-in at both airports was efficient and staff were knowledgeable. Boarding was also good. The service in the sky was acceptable. The food was bland ( as I have now been told is Ethiopian food).

As I was connecting overnight, the airline put me in a transit hotel both ways. This is were the problem is. Ethiopian Airways need to monitor their hotel partners. At the two hotels I transited in, the food was the worst I have ever eaten. undercooked and unseasoned. In one hotel (Caravan) all guests almost revolted!

"Spoke to Hadija the entire afternoon to confirm that all my docs were in check and that I was good to go.

I get to airport and ground handling by NAS is totally unhelpful, refers to some outdated rule book and refuses acknowledge that the Ethiopian airlines staff had actually spoken to destination and had given me the green light.

The Airline rep refused to come out of her office to come solve let alone listen to the situation.

I missed the flight, Lost time, money and most importantly 500 young africans looking forward to some wisdom will miss out.

The Nas handler called Annette is more interested in following the book rather than rational and understanding.

"My very long drama will be cut short if I simply stick to reviewing the customer service provided by ticket agents, telephone support and inflight amenties/staff.

Purchased my flights (departing Charlotte, NC heading to Tanzania), but since EA has no presence in my neck of the woods, I had to connect via United from CLT to Dulles. The day before my flight I received a text from UA saying my flight was cancelled. That's where my frustration began. On the phone with EA customer support took so long - made several calls.

Helpful tip: select SHEBA miles customer for a slighter shorter wait time.

EA kept saying that I needed to contact UA about my cancelled flight, but UA said that I needed to connect with EA (since that's where I purchased my tickets).

After several phone calls, UA finally indicated they were able to get me on an AA flight out of Charlotte. I arrive at CLT (airport) attempt to check in & the AA agent tells me I'm ""not on this flight"".

Short version: I ended up purchasing airfare to get me from CLT to Reagan airport in D.C. (for an overnight stay, to then attempt to grab my original Dulles connection to Addis Ababa). In addition to the $147 for my one way ticket, I had to pay baggage fee for my carry on small backpack), I had to book a hotel for the night because my flight to the continent would leave the following morning, plus pay for Uber to get me from Reagan to the hotel (that night), plus an Uber for the next morning.

I arrived at Dulles the following morning only to be told by the ticket agent at EA that (a) I wasn't on the flight to Addis (connecting to another flight in Ethiopia to Dar es Salaam), (b) EA wasn't responsible for correcting UA's issue & (c) a supervisor would need to help remedy my situation (said ""supervisor"" hadn't yet arrived.

Short version here - the supervisor showed up, I shared with him all of my phone frustration, flight cancellation back & forth EA to UA with both claiming they weren't responsible, the extra cash I shelled out to arrive in D.C. for a connecting flight.

Oh man !!! The supervisor was able to get me on the EA flight after speaking with UA. He gives me my boarding pass along with one for my EA flight from Addis to Dar. I ask him ""so, I'll have no issues getting on the flight from Addis to Dar?"" He confirms that it'll be fine and I have my boarding pass. I thank him for his efforts, along with the other agent (after all, they truly were patient with my dilemma & got me on the flight).

13 + hours later (mask & all), I land in Addis Ababa..chill out at the airport for a few hours until my flight is ready to board. At the gate, the EA agent takes my passport & boarding pass, checks in the system - then in a soft voice says ""miss, you're not booked on this flight""

At that point, all I could muster was a smile (at least I had safely arrived on the continent - Mama Africa had welcomed me). Eventually, the EA agent was able to get me a seat.

Because of the UA - EA fiasco with my cancelled flight from Charlotte, I ended up arriving in Tanzania on 1 Jan, instead of 31 Dec....so I spent new year's flying (at least we were safe - not the biggest tragedy).

Inflight review - flight attendants friendly & helpful when I indicted I had paid for vegetarian meal. the flight from Dulles to Addis was packed with bunch of folks not listening to instructions, babies crying and people leaving luggage in the aisles.

Food - was happy to get my vegetarian (warm) tray (was likely pasta - rice), nothing too spectacular (honestly, Turkish Airlines is my favorite for airline food).

Have decided to consider other airlines for my next trip to Mama Africa.
Again, the staff gets a higher rating, but EA corporate really needs to up their game insofar as that phone support.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/81/b5/ad/lola-y.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latrekista,Lola R. wrote a review Feb 2021,Lola R.,"Charlotte, North Carolina",137 contributions,25 helpful votes,Washington DC - Dar es Salaam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r783343709-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ticket Agents Helpful - Phone Support Very Frustrating,Date of travel: January 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Worst airlines to deal with, they say free change but they will charge you for taxes & fares when you haven’t even checked in yet.

Absolute rip off & total scam! I will never fly with them again even if it’s for free. They are liars. You would rather pay extra with another airline, but don’t bother with Ethiopian airlines!

They don’t help you they don’t care about you or your circumstances, I was suffering from Corona & they didn’t help me change my flight, I had to pay to change the date.

We were supposed to have a connecting flight from addis ababa to manila but when we were about to embark on the plane they held us up because of the new protocol of the philippine govt. that only 50 passenger are allowed for the plane. So the last 10 to book their flight seats were to be left behind. The airline told us theyd get us free hotel rooms for the stay so atleast we were glad. But after 2 hours we were still waiting for our hotel booking. So we kept on asking when will wee go to the hotel but the staff of the airline told us coming coming. It was until about 8am that our papers were processed after waiting for about 8 hours. This is not how you treat costumers. Never recommend this airline guys. Repect begets respect.

Ethiopian Airlines the airline staffed by thieves! My Mom flew from Stockholm to Nairobi and her luggage went missing. Then apparently it was found and they opened it and were asking my brother to describe the contents.

I was very angry but again I understand public health precautions. I didn't want to force it because I might have the virus and transmit it to other passengers. I called the Ethiopian airline customer service to do a rebook, I told me I have to pay a penalty and fare difference even there was no fare difference. I explained to an agency about my situation, they said, it's not their business or fault and if I want to fly to, should the amount of $375 or no flight.

"I arrived at Manchester Airport Terminal 1 at 16.45 to fly out at 18.55.
I had already checked in online so went straight to the front of the passport queue. On my ticket it stated 2 bags for my allowance, 30kg and 7kg.

However at the checking in desk they said it was 2 bags at a max of 23kg each and a hand baggage.
So I had to buy another suitcase at £75 to split the load then check 2 cases in.

After checking in the 2 suitcases I then made my way to the departure lounge and waited in a new queue for the hand luggage weigh in. This was not mentioned at the normal check in either.

The new allowance for hand luggage is now 12kg and a £10 fine for every kg over. This new fee was also not explained at the checking in desk.

The aircraft took off and landed in Brussels to pick up passengers on route to Ethiopia. I questioned one person boarding in Brussels if they had the same problem. No was the answer their allowance was 2 bags only.

Once I arrived in Ethiopia I questioned this case split and fee and they were not aware of it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/c7/5d/69/mick-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/764mickp,Mick P wrote a review Jan 2021,Mick P,"Catterick, United Kingdom",217 contributions,177 helpful votes,Manchester - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r780788693-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Unhelpful ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The airplane from ADD to WDH has been changed on the last moment, my seat has been changed from 12A to 38A, which was very unexpected and disappointing, because I had to be picked up from Windhoek and brought to Swakopmund. I asked twice the crew to change the seat and they did not do it until I asked their team leader to come and explain the situation, why I could not be seated in the nose part of the plain. At the end they managed to find the place.
Another point that should be addressed is the number of forms that passengers shall fill in before landing, so that they do not spend time doing it on the ground. Since my seat number has been changed, 1 out of 3 forms was finished. I assume, it is not difficult to count how many passengers on the plane and load the exact or even 10% more forms. I printed this form out at home, so did not have to get one from the crew.
The last point is the serving. I asked for a coffee when the crew was serving for the first time. They said it will come with the next round. Actually, since I was alone on the row, they just skipped me and did not offer any coffee. I had to call them and asked for the second time.
Both times the entire plane was waiting for the luggage longer than 1h!

"Worst airline I have ever been on in all of my travels throughout the world.

The website communications is super vague and hard to locate any helpful information. I tried to write a complaint through the webpage but I received a message saying it's unavailable, now over a week.

Before I booked Ethiopian Airlines I saw this on the webpage about COVID-19 ""The safety, security and good health of our passengers and employees is our highest priority."" This was not the case on our flights. I felt very concerned for the health of my wife who is 5 months pregnant and myself. There was absolutely no social-distancing.

Our first flight was overweight with luggage and we were delayed, after boarding the flight, for 1 hour and 30 minutes on the tarmac.
Over half of the passengers on the flight were not wearing masks and many were walking around talking with people seated right next to us.
The bathrooms were the filthiest I have ever experienced and not cleaned at all during the flight. Our trash from our meal was not picked up for over an hour after our meal.

Once we arrived to the airport our luggage took over an hour to come out.
I tried contacting the airline for over a week via email, their webpage chat, multiple phone numbers (with a call back option but never received a call back), and web complaint system all of these failed to work.
During our trip we never received any information or email about where to get our PCR Covid-19 test. Dubai said they required it from a certain lab ICL so ICL booked our appointment for us. When we arrived for our appointment they refused us and said we must go to Ethiopian Airlines, even though they knew all our flight info when we booked. We had to go to Ethiopian Airlines Office which we finally found out through multiple phone calls, but we never received any of this information from Ethiopian Airlines. We spent a full day traveling around the city to find the testing location.

Our return flight during COVID regulations on December 22, 2020 was overbooked. I asked customer service about our seats and social distancing and I was promised by a manager we would have an empty seat next to my wife for her safety. However that promise was not kept and the flight staff was not very kind or reasonable with us when we reminded them of this promise. This flight was not much better than our first, the bathrooms were still filthy and people were not wearing their masks.

My biggest issue with Ethiopian Airlines is their significant lack of customer service and clarity to provide accurate helpful information. For this reason, I will avoid their airline in my future travels.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/todd-220,Todd B. wrote a review Dec 2020,Todd B.,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Dubai - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r779835248-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Awful Customer Service & Communication,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Even during Covid times Ethiopian provided great service in Business Class. Their new A350 with 1-2-1 configuration provide the best comfort.

Pre-departure selection of Champagne or OJ was offered. After take off guests were offered refill and some crackers. Dinner options are reduced due to Covid to three options (one vegetarian). All meals are served on one tray except desserts. Those are offered from a tray (all wrapped in plastic foils).

"I have never been so appalled at an airline in my life.

Below I have outlined my experience of Ethiopian airlines:

Cabin Crew:

Ethiopian airlines have a very female cabin crew as throughout my entire flight I did not see any male cabin crew. Perhaps it in not the fashion in Ethiopia to have male flight attendants. It would seem Ethiopian airlines is still behind the times with its patriarchal take on the sex of cabin crew. Furthermore, the airline appears to hire fair skinned Ethiopian women, rather than a diverse range of skin tones.

This level racism became increasingly obvious as the flight progressed and we landed in addis abba were i noticed that the only dark skinned crew were the cleaners between connecting flights and in the airport cleaning toilets.

Service:
I appreciate that Zimbabwe does not have a functioning airline however it does not mean standards of other airlines flying to Zimbabwe should drop. On the return flight passengers were loaded onto a uncleaned aircraft from Robert Mugabe international airport to Lusaka international. Passengers had no access to clean headphones and it was evident that the pillows had not been changed. Not only as we are in a global pandemic that it is paramount to keep up cleanliness standards, but it is important that paying passengers are seated in a clean space. Only in Lusaka where cleaners allowed to board where they only cleaned the unoccupied seats. Those of us who were seated watching as we knew that where we sat had not been cleaned from the previous trip, I would like to know what possible justification EA has for this?

On the return leg between Addis Ababa and London the aircrafts air conditioning was extremely cold and people in economy where evidently cold. Ethiopian did not provide blankets to be readily available and it was necessary to ask for these blankets. It was very difficult asking for a blanket as the crew were hostlie in giving one, especially as i had asked for two, one for my elderly aunt and another for my sister. They assumed i was trying to get two for myself and were very quick to shut me down.

I couldn’t help look around and notice that we were all the sub Saharan Africans dark in complexion and felt maybe this poor treatment was something only reserved for us. When I asked for anything I thought as if I was begging as I asked for a second cup of tea due to how cold the cabin was.

The service on our flight from London to Ethiopia was significantly better than the connecting flight from Ethiopia to Zambia and then Harare. However between London and Ethiopia cabin crew where very short and did not exhibit good customer service that you might expect when you have paid for your ticket. Cabin crew regularly pushed passed and aggressively leaned over passengers without the slightest courteous “excuse me”. Cabin Crew lacked the simple acknowledgment and respect that a human being was in their way let alone a paying customer

It was though we had reverted to no more than cattle being transported. All levels of customer service grew more and more insincere as the flight progressed. Staff would say the correct things (call you sir), but would exhibit the body language of someone just wanting to get the job done and be over with. I couldn't help but think i was being discriminated against because i am a dark skinned African.

Writing this i understand that there is a difference between first class, business and economy service however I believe that an airline should exhibit good customer service as a bare minimum throughout the classes.

Food:
the Ethiopian airlines economy menu seemed never stray from a chicken or beef option with a veg box consisting of a bun. Some type of salad and a dessert. This was acceptable, and the food generally was edible. The appearance of the food was not so pleasant in both settings and sometimes the food was inconsistently heated. Those of us who had the food all suffered from food poisoning.

I pray the airline improves and takes note from its competitors Kenyan, Rwanda, SA who also run this leg. I will mot be flying with Ethiopian airlines again if I can help it. I think the additional £200 or so above the nominal ticket price for any other airline is with it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/69/avatar047.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannamX2421TN,Kudzani Makanda wrote a review Dec 2020,Kudzani Makanda,,2 contributions,5 helpful votes,Harare - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r778944694-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,RACIST Pathetic Excuse for an airline and unworthy of their slogan!

"I am a Filipino worker holding roundtrip ticket to Luanda. Supposedly my return trip to the Philippines is on July 2020. Because of the Covid Pandemic, Ethiopian Airlines cancelled their flights out of Luanda to Manila. Now, since their flight have resume, they cannot assist me in going home without paying the upgrade booking class that they are saying. And said flight i took have a lot of vacant seats. so I paid the upgrade surcharge. Per their Global center when I did the rebooking, they dont control the seats.

"I had read reviews about Ethiopian Airlines that made me question whether I should use them for a flight from Dulles to Lusaka. But I also have done a lot of international travel and have learned to adjust my expectations based on a lot of factors. Last year my wife and I flew Emirates to Lusaka. $6,000-plus. This year we flew Ethiopian. $3,000, give or take.
Ethiopian is somewhat like Southwest in the US. Compared to a lot of airlines that flew African routes prior to COVID, it was affordable to a lot more travelers, and still is. As a result planes are more likely to be filled with families and inexperienced travelers. That can led to some crying kids. But, that is not on the arline.
As for Ethiopian Airlines, in a nutshell the flight crew service was very good, the plane was clean. The food was actually better than I have had in economy on pricier airlines.
In flight entertainment is less that on pricier airlines, but mixed with eating, sleeping, reading it’s adequate.
I have read reviews about flights on EA having filty restrooms. We did not experience that. Maybe it’s because we are flying in the COVID world but I observed crew santiizing and cleaning restrooms roughly every 90 minutes.
In terms of COVID there was good mask compliance - a few violators here and there. On a plane social distancing was not possible. My wife and I wore KN95 masks in our seats and an additional plastic full-face covering during boarding and in the airports.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichHeil,Rich H wrote a review Dec 2020,Rich H,"Huntsville, Texas",30 contributions,46 helpful votes,Washington DC - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r778887146-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ethiopian exceed expectations,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelling has been a nightmare for most people nowadays due to the Pandemic. The least we expect is a safe environment and an excellent service.

An incident that made me rate this trip as TERRIBLE was due to one FA. Reprimanded me not just once but thrice about standing.

If you are in an 11 hour straight flight, you need to get some good stretch and trips to comfort rooms once in a while. Encountered the FA telling me that I am not allowed to stand up due to COVID was way too dramatic. Social distancing cannot be practised inside the plane, for the flight was almost full. And this particular FA went back to me holding her Tab and wanted to lecture me about their manual for new covid measures....that all started from standing to que for the loo.

A supervisor approached me, wanted to rectify the issue and was apologetic on behalf of her staff. Hands off to you Sup. Though the FA came to apologize, felt it was a bit less sincere. She did it for the sake of her Supervisor, who told her to say sorry to me.

"one of the check-in advisors. I don't know the name of the adviser but she was the one managing the queue to direct customers which counter to go to. The flight was on 19/11/2020 from Manchester airport to Belgium. The people travelling were my wife and my two small kids, they were travelling on from Belgium to Ethiopia then to Khartoum.

We arrived me and my family around 4:30 pm and because of cov19 the airport customer service were not going to allow me to enter the airport to assist my wife, however after they realised that she could not possibly manage all the luggage and the two small children alone, they let me enter with her to help check-in.

We did the online check-in and we head to the counter to hand in our passport and weigh the luggage. The agent checked the passports and handed them back (no problem was identified with the passports or tickets) she asked us to put the luggage on the scale she found the luggage overweight one bag was 36kg and the other one was 34kg she said our regulation only allowed you to take 32kg. I asked for advice on what to do, she started to explain to me and then another agent interrupted her by shouting on her from the side in a very unprofessional manner. This other agent told the lady ""send them away""

I asked her why she was speaking to us like that and she kept shouting at me that she doesn't care. I explained that I had not travelled abroad from the UK before and I don't know the regulation, but she kept telling me she doesn't care, and the manner in which she spoke to me and my wife was so rude she did not try to offer any kind of way to resolve our problem.

I felt really disgusted from her attitude, I left the queue to try to help my wife empty some of the luggage.

I asked my wife to run to the car park to get an empty gym bag I started to take some items out the bags. I managed to reduce the weight of her bags and went straight back to the queue at that time there are two people in front of us in the queue and I left the two bags in the queue and walk 10 seconds away to get the remaining items
Then when I came in this 10 seconds they decide the check-in is closed.

The agent was shouting at us did not show any respect toward us, or show customer service. I told here I came from Glasgow which is 3 and a half hour driving and petrol money and my wife has go back to do another cov19 test because of her attitude. She replied she doesn't care.
and believe she stopped my wife from checking in on purpose because of the situation a little earlier.
There are two airport customer service they confirmed that she was rude to me and that the way she acted was not professional. She refused to provide her name to allow me to complain before leaving the airport.

We left and rebooked another ticket which cost an extra £298 and the other ticket was for 24/11/20. My wife arrived and again the same agent was there. When she saw my wife and the two kids she recognised them and she went to the counter and talked to the other agent who was seeing to my wife.

After she talked to the other agent the agent said the names are not correct on the tickets, last time they did not mention that so they ask my wife to pay £120 to get them changed.
I am not happy with the way the agent treated me and my family and we all feel disgusted from the way she treated us.

"I flew on Ethiopian airlines this year from Manzini Swaziland to Accra Ghana. Initially I was booked on Airlink from Manzini to Johannesburg and South African Airways from Johannesburg to Accra, but due to COVID-19 SAA stopped all their flights on the very day I was supposed to travel.

I was kinda stranded for a bit with only a ticket to Johannesburg and since I didn't have a Visa in South Africa I wouldn't have been allowed to board the flight to later on become stranded in OR Tambo Airport. So at the last minute I was booked on Ethiopian airlines from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa that night and from Addis Ababa to Accra the next morning. Might I say that my Jobrug-Addis flight was particularly good even though it was full, at first I thought I was to fly 737-800 but that night I flew the dreamliner dash 8 and the food as well as the IFE and the legroom was very good howbeit the flight attendants were a bit stressed given that this was the last flight out of OR Tambo and the pandemic was changing a lot of things in their lives, so I understood.

I arrived around 5am at Bole the next morning and was surprised to be quickly whisked through security and customs (most people complain of the congestion at Bole) and I had about a 3 hour layover. Then I boarded my flight to Accra which was an a350-900 and this flight came with the added advantage of free WiFI howbeit limited to WhatsApp and only for an hour unless one intended to pay. The food was great again, the IFE and seating was the same as the dreamliner but the flight was slightly better due to less people on board and the service was on time and good. I arrived in Accra safely (which was actually the last flight before the airport started quarantine) and I just headed home to my family.

All in all I was impressed with Ethiopian airlines and their service given the chaotic circumstances at the time and I really like their fleet which includes newer aircraft until with SAA which still uses the older a340s (actually I was booked on an a330-300 that night from Joburg to Accra). And the service is way better than SAA as well as the quality of food, I will definitely fly them again !

PS. I never got my refund from SAA for my ticket as they have collapsed now in bankruptcy and I probably will not get it back.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9421GCkelvins,Kelvin S wrote a review Nov 2020,Kelvin S,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Manzini - Accra,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r778054057-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good airline with good service,Date of travel: March 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A real disgrace to both the country and the airline. I was recently booked on a flight to South Africa with Ethiopian Airlines out of Newark.

"I flew to Brazil 2 months prior to this. Consulted with the Federal Police about my family coming here and found out what was required by them and made all arrangements. When the time came for the flight they were refused boarding because they were booked to fly on another airline (a better airline) to fly back with me. When I contacted them by the online web phone they gave me a run around. First they told me that Brazil would not allow them entry. I informed them I was in Brazil and had made arrangements and confirmed with immigration about all the entry requirements before ordering a ticket. They then told me it was the airlines policy. I asked for a refund and to speak to a supervisor and was told both were not possible. I was told that it was the passengers responsibility to make sure entry requirements were met and they were so that story changed to it was the airlines policy and there is no where written that a return ticket needs to be purchased thorough them. When I asked where I could find this information I did not get any answer except I would need to use google. They then hung up on me. I called again and went through the same ordeal, the supervisor was in a meeting and when I wanted to see where I could find this return ticket policy once again we somehow got disconnected. 3rd time i called, same thing ending with a disconnection when I asked for proof of policy. 4th time, it happened again, and the 5th time and so on until after a full day of calling and asking to see how I could have found this information I finally decided to have her call.

"The staff right from the time of checking in to the end of the flight are very rude. They do not know how to talk to passengers. If you ask a question or a clarification, they point you towards someone else and pretend to be busy. The cabin crew talk to to passengers like they are talking to kids. They say no to requests and just walk away without giving an explanation.  No screens in the flight but when u check the type of aeroplane they are using online,  they do have. Just a bad flight and poor service.  One time I asked for a bottle of water , the flight attendant just said no and walked away.

We were due to fly with Ethiopian airline to Madagascar this month but were informed of the flight cancellation 2 weeks in advance. Originally when I called I had a nightmare trying to get hold of someone as they would say they were unable to hear me due to issues on the line. They then said that that I would be charged a cancellation fee if the flight was cancelled due to government restrictions rather than the airline cancelling the trip and that I would need to wait up to 6 months for a refund. I was very annoyed at this point and sent an email to highlight my frustrations. Less than one week later I’ve received the full refund on my credit card - I did not expect a refund this quickly at all based on the current situation and people’s experience with other UK airlines. So I felt compelled to highlight what a fantastic yet unexpected outcome I’ve had with Ethiopian and I would certainly consider them again for further flights!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/65/ef/63/kasarin1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kasarin1,Kasarin1 wrote a review Nov 2020,Kasarin1,"London, United Kingdom",21 contributions,21 helpful votes,London - Antananarivo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r776490141-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Unexpectedly Efficient cancellation process ,Date of travel: November 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The first airline that I saw charging $200 for 2 kg over carry-on luggage. Terrible thing is they will get you on transit. And all this happening is due to covid passengers must check in their carry-on luggage and if its more than 10 kg doesn't matter your on transit or not you are going to pay $200.

"Not too bad to be honest. If you are a snob then I could see this airline being a problem.
I was flying ftom Heathrow to Mogadishu via Addis and it was very straight forward, no problems with immigration or passport control, all the measures in place to do with covid.
Food on board the flight was ok, nice and hot with 2 choices. They served soft drinks, tea coffee and alcohol. Staff were accommodating if you wanted an extra drink, very pleasant and helpful.
Airport in Ethiopia is undergoing repairs and you can see all the rubbish outside, they don't have any screens or protection against it.
The staff were very friendly on the aircraft and at the airport. The coffee and croissants were very nice and cheap compared to other airport cafes i have eaten at.

The headache starts when you try to check in as it now takes about 2 hours checking in your luggage waiting in line with not enough workers at the counter.
The boarding started earlier than the time on booking and they dont announce that on the microphones for some reason, so you can't take faster line. And I saw so many people miss their flight even though they came early and I just made it by spriting to the gate which was so far away from passport check.

1) Both my flights were delayed
2) The staff barely speak English and their are among the rudest crew in the airline industry.
3) I discovered the toothpaste they offered me was past its expiry date by 4months.
4) The airline is cheap so you get the cheapest service. No hard liqor just wine and some terrible tasting beer.

"I would give them zero stars, literally..I flew with business class and here is how the experience was:

1) their systems did not work, so check in took me 2 hours despite flying with business class, and they offered no sympathy or explanation whatsoever, which brings me to my second point

2) bad customer service. I have flown on airlines like Swiss, Lufthansa, KLM, Emirates and Qatar. When you fly these airlines, you see what good customer service is. Everyone from those at the check in counter, to the flight attendants had horrible customer service, despite me being in business class. I can’t imagine how they are to people in economy

3) Our flight was delayed by 4 hours due to their bad check in systems (I guess their computers were down), but they kept us waiting in the airplane for 4 hours without the air conditioning on. Let that sink in, 4hours, we all had masks on due to COVID, stuck in the plane for 4 hours

4) as if that wasn’t enough, when we finally took off, it turns out that the TVs they had were just to decorate the plane, because the TVs did not work the entire flight. No TVs for a 12 hour flight from IAH to LOS, in business class.

Also, look at the terrible looking seat in my attached picture, I wiped down my seat handles and they looked like I put the wipe in a bucket of sand. You would expect an airline making $3,000 for a one-way business class ticket Would be able to keep the plane clean...

5) finally, we arrive at the destination and my luggage’s which should be priority as I was in business class came out about 20minutes after some non-priority bags came out. Weird considering I paid $3,000 for my flight

6) overall, please spare yourself the trouble, and use an European or Asian airline. People warned me not to use Ethiopian but as a Nigerian, I thought I should give them a try.

"Never have I wished that an airline company would go under as much as Ethiopian. Echoing the statements of others, their customer service is nonexistent and if you're calling about a refund, don't bother. They will clutch onto the cash like their lives depended on it and force you to settle for a travel credit.

Case in point: Ethiopian changed the date of travel and in that circumstance, you're entitled to a full cash refund. No matter how many times I've spoken with them, they will not process refunds under ANY circumstance.

To those affected by these idiots, don't despair. People have long memories and as a collective, stuff like this will never be forgotten. They won't survive this crisis and given the choice, I'd rather ride a donkey for 40 days to my destination than get on board an Ethiopian flight.

"I flew from London Heathrow to Addis Ababa with Ethiopian airlines. The process boarding the plane was good, many seats empty so I could have a whole row to myself.
First problem was the Inflight entertainment. All the screens were not working so the only way I could enjoy myself was by watching things I downloaded on my phone. We were Lucky it was an overnight flight so we didn’t get too bored. The flight was smooth with no turbulence alhamdulilah.

Dinner was served. It was chicken with boiled rice amongst other little snacks. The only palatable thing was the chocolate mousse. I repeatedly asked the steward if the food was halal but he didn’t give a definite answer. The rice was bland so were the vegetables. soon I slept and was woken abruptly by the stewardess giving out snacks. Other airlines I fly with are much more gentle in this situation.

The food made me sick to the stomach and for 2 days I couldn’t eat or smell a thing without throwing it up. I spent 8 hours transit in Addis Ababa airport and was promised a hotel to stay in. This was not provided. The restaurant in the hotel had horrible meals on their menu and totally not worth the price. The staff are unhelpful as well.

"The worst airline ever. Avoid it at all costs.
I was travelling with my Mom in January and the service- or what they call it service- was unspeakable.
The plane itself was dirty, the sets and the alley. Full of marks on the seats, no aircondition nd it was uncomfortably hot during the 8 hour flight from Addis Ababa.
I was waiting 20 minutes for a glass of water and eventually had to get up from my seat to ask for one. All flight attendees were gathering in the alley with their tea/coffee having laughs and chats and when I asked for water I was told they have no time and I will get some when they will have time. This incident repeated 3 more times. Travelling with a disabled elderly parent is stressful enough and they have no compassion or manners for that matter. The food was inedible and everybody sent it back exactly the way it was dished. All crew was eating from the business class as I've seen it every time I had to get up to get a glass of water.
I wanted to upgrade us to business class for our return flight, but the hassle with it is not worth it. I had to book another return flight with Emirates.
I contacted their customer service team who only acknowledged my email and replied 2.5 months later. Apart from an apology of their late reply they didn't do anything. I asked for a refund for my return ticket but haven't even received a reply.

Would not recommend this airline to anybody.

My flight was cancelled by Ethiopian Airlines and I’ve called and messaged them several times for a refund. They have stopped replying to me now. I even mailed a certified letter along with all the personal info they asked for to their customer refund center address in Va. that I found online. They haven’t accepted the package. They did offer a voucher however when I looked up flights going to Accra this month and next few months the price was doubled and the travel time also doubled. $1000.00 more for a trip that is 20 hours longer was the norm for flights I looked at.

"We had business class tickets booked for June/July for a much anticipated trip to Africa. Communication was poor, as could be expected, regarding if the flight was cancelled (Uganda is closed to outsiders). I was told my flight was cancelled, then told it wasn’t.... I was told we could only get vouchers. I’m not going to spend thousands of dollars on an airline not on my continent, and uncertain if we will be able to reschedule the trip.

Moral of story - 1 month prior to our trip I finally got an email saying my flight was officially cancelled. I called to request refund, told they only gave vouchers.... once again referred to the DOT release from April stating they were obligated to refund our tickets even if it was due to pandemic.... asked to speak to manager... told a refund would take 3+ months.... said that’s just fine. Waited 40 minutes.... told they would process refund.... told them I’d wait for confirmation email..... 3 days later it was back on my credit card

I will NEVER book with them again. Even when we reschedule our trip for November or future, I will pay more for other flights from other airlines. Worst experience I have ever had with customer service. Demand your money back, eventually they will give it. They are fully aware of the DOT statement, they quoted it to me.

"DO NOT TRUST!! BIG SCAM

I had bought a flight with confirmation from the airline that the flights were operational and I would be able to cancel and get a refund any time before the flight. Besides their wide advertisement for any time free cancellations and refund they will not refund you.
My flight USUBCT was cancelled twice and due for cancellation again, it was a stopover flight and my connecting flight doesn't even appear anymore as if it never existed. They have a cancellation option which states that I am not elegible for cancellation when I try to use it. I have contacted them inumerous times as my flight was ridiculously expensive for a one way and they are refusing to give me a refund and instead offering a year's worth usage voucher for FUTURE travel. I will never pay this amount for any flight if it weren't COVID19 so why would I accept it instead of getting my money back?

"I wanted to write about my recent FANTASTIC experience with Ethiopian Airlines and in particular a very kind employers that went above and beyond to help me with an issue. I was transporting my two dogs of an emergency flight from Asmara, Eritrea to a London flight and not only did the animals have to transit through Addis, they had to go from being checked baggage to Cargo.

This would have been challenging at the best of times but add into the situation the fact i was not travelling with them and that there were a lot more restrictions than normal due to COVID-19.

On ringing up for help (after, granted what was several days of phoning) I was eventually put in touch with 3 fantastic Cargo EA employees; Mr Asnake, Mr Tsehau and Mr Kifle. These three men not only assisted me in safely moving the dogs from one flight to another but also the payment, they also ensured the dogs were taken on and safe and they even updated me every step of the way.

"Returning home to Canada a week earlier than planned but ahead of our  Prime Minister’s call to return, Ethiopian was already asking where we’d been (especially Italy, Iran and China at that point). There were fewer people on the flight so most middle seats were open; a good coincidence for social distancing. When we landed in Toronto March 12, we didn’t have to hang around the baggage carousels because we took our back packs as carry on (Toronto notoriously terrible for quick bag recovery). Quick passport checks in an empty arrival hall and another question about where we’d been and we were done. A good experience.

"The airline fly quite new planes that are in god condition. service on board is good as well as food served.
The problem is with the managing of flights.
my flight was a connection flight through addis airport. The airline change my flight from Addis to Tel Aviv and don't change my EBB-ADD flight time so in order not wait in Addis airport 13 hours I had to change this leg as well and it was done by chat with no fees but very long wait but the agent was helpful.
I checked on line, when I arrived at Entente I got seats that was not according to my check in, I returns to the agent and the problem was the airline change the plane and seats were different, it took them a very long time to put us together on the same row after 3 agents were involve in trying to make the change.
The entrance to the check was not organized.

"I booked a 1-way ticket from Cape Town back home to Dallas and paid for it in full on Ethiopian Airline's own website. When I got to the airport, in Cape Town, the person behind the Ethiopian Airlines counter said the connection between Dublin and Washington Dulles airport was cancelled due to the CoronaVirus. But FlightAware showed the flight going ahead. At the airport they would not book me on another flight, but told me I would have to go online and find another flight and gave me a voucher to use. I booked another flight for a couple of days later, this one flying to Houston. When I got to the airport, they told me that the flight was overbooked and since I had not actually paid, but only had a voucher, I did not have a seat. Again they would not rebook me on another flight. So I booked on yet another flight again to Houston, went in the next morning to Ethiopian Airlines office in Cape Town and paid with the voucher. Got my seat confirmed, and got my board passes. But once I got to the airport, again they told me the flight was no longer flying to Houston. And gave me another voucher. But yet again FlightAware showed that the flight arrived in Houston without any problems. As an American Citizen, there were no issues with me returning to Texas. I have now had to book and pay for a new ticket with United Airlines.

"Whole experience from checking in to the 4 hours layover  in Addis Ababa was below my expectation. Checking-in procedure in Cape Town was very long. It took agent more than 40 min to proceed with checking for 4 of us. Seats we booked via Ethiopian Airline office in Cape Town had been given to someone else. In-flight service was very unprofessional. I had feeling that some crew members did not even speak English at all. I took liberty to provide feedback in online survey. Cabin was  quite dirty and toilets condition once approaching destination were far from being usable. Transit area in Adiss Ababa does not offer too much either.

"Although, I have just written a review few days ago after my hard departure trips from Riyadh to Cape Town where was on very old aircraft, I found I must write this one after the excellent experience I had in my return flights.

For departure flights, it was one leg on economy class and 2nd leg on business class and both were on old air crafts as I explained has almost lot issues in clean and functioning of materials like chairs and shelfs.

Now, in my return trip, both legs were on business class and I was surprised the both flights were on new air crafts with high quality equipment and services.

My concerns are:

- Food is not good either on economy or business. It should be more internationalized

- No WiFi / Internet available on the flights

- No Arabic or English subtitles available for the movies and entertainment programs.

"We did a round trip from London to Addis Ababa, with a further three internal flights in Ethiopia (which were pretty cheap add-ons). Once on the planes, they're pretty standard, and reminded me of how European flights were 20 years ago -- cabin staff running round to hand out drinks and snacks on even the shortest flights.   Movie choices on intercontinental flights were a bit B-grade, but economy-class catering was pretty reasonable.   Lots of confusion, delays, and general chaos at all the local airports -- well, actually, at Addis Ababa Bole, too -- but hey, this is Africa.The real problem came when I tried to check-in on-line the day before my return flight to London, scheduled early on a Sunday.  That went smoothly, except that I was assigned a seat on a Monday flight.   Eh what?  The only practical way to resolve this, late on Saturday night, was to go in person to the EA desk at their flagship hotel, the Ethiopian Skylight.   All they could do there was to confirm that my flight had been cancelled, for reasons that are still unexplained to this day (though I strongly suspect that it may've been simply because of light loading).At this point you'd think they could've just issued a hotel voucher for the additional night that I was now forced to stay;  but no.   Even though my flight had been cancelled, I was *required*  still to go to the airport at the crack of dawn the next day, and not(!) check in, before they would give me the voucher!   How barmy is that?And I have to say, too, that the hotel they put me up in, the Debredamo, is a real dump.   Check out the TA reviews -- at the time of writing, it's ranked ""#128 of 166 Hotels in Addis Ababa"".

"First of all, I would like to clarify that this is not a review based on actually flying with Ethiopian airlines it's about my experience with trying to make a reservation. This company is running a scam, where they advertise some fares on some third party website like google flights, Expedia, wego,...etc and then when I got transferred to their website to make the reservation, it errored out, saying that the flight is no longer available even if continue to appear in the search after that.
Also when I finally got a reservation, once transferred to the payment page, it told me that the fare has been increased.
I have accepted all their games to this point but then when I tried to make the hicked payment, it errored out only to find out later that my credit card has been charged the full amount.
I tried to reach out to them, it was very difficult to speak to someone and impossible to talk to a supervisor. Someone actually told me that their policy doesn't allow supervisors to take calls from customers.
I was finally given an email for tech support who tried to waist time in response until the flight dates, they even tried to play games, pretending that they cannot understand my request.
I ended up with $1200 down the drain for a service that I never got.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmadMahdy,EmadMahdy wrote a review Mar 2020,EmadMahdy,"Cairo, Egypt",2 contributions,3 helpful votes,Cairo - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r750511337-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Scammers,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I remember Ethiopian Airlines' services and Addis airport of 2004 - 2010. They were average compared to KQ or Emirates. It took long, but they renovated Addis Ababa airport - well, still they do not have enough sitting capacity for the peak hours - early morning / late evening. The Addis airport has some coffee shops, but the food options are extremely limited compared to Nairobi / Dubai. Along with renovations / expansion of the airport & airline, the pax footfall also increased.

But the airline has improved a lot. They have better aircraft and services comparatively. The fares are competitive. They also offer on arrival visa for passengers looking for a short break in the transit - and like other airlines, their fares still remain same. The city is close to airport. The hotel rates are reasonable.

Ethiopian airlines has lot to offer, if you see all the above as a package. In one fare, one can visit two countries at least.

"I have lived in Ethiopia for many years and although I used to fly with other airlines because they were cheaper, I started to fly with Ethiopian airlines using the direct flights to Madrid. That means that I was willing to pay more so I wouldn't have to waste my time in layovers. However, the last time I booked a direct flight from Addis Ababa to Madrid I ended up having a 2 and 3 hours stop in Cairo and Rome even though my flight was purchased as direct. The worst part is that I found out about these changes once I was on the plane because they did not even have the courtesy to inform via email.

"I chose flying between Brazil and India by Ethiopian initially because of the lowest airfares, but it was a very pleasant surprise to find out that this is a top-service company. I had a complex set of flight schedules to my destination and was horrified when the first one out of São Paulo was cancelled due to extreme weather conditions. No problem: Ethiopian staff arranged for everything from my accommodation, transfers and meals both in São Paulo and at the unforeseen stopover in Addis Ababa, to the maze of rearrangements of connecting flights. Planes were new and comfortable, and in-flight service and entertainment were excellent. Given past horrible experiences in companies such as United and American, which abandon you stranded at the airport to fend for yourself at the slightest glitch, it was a blessing to have helping, caring staff dealing with my travel needs for a change.

"Ethiopian Airlines is a COMPLETE SCAM. The Global Call Center customer service is terrible. All they do is put you on hold as they speak to a supervisor (there no supervisor during U.S. daytime so you must call between 12am - 7am EST). After hours of holding on the phone (literally 2 hours to solve 1 issue), the response is that they will email you back with confirmation. I NEVER received the email and then am forced to start the 2 hour process over again with a different representative the next day.
IF you have to change a flight, the airline's website tells you to call them. Flight changes on their service line are nearly double the fare from what's listed online. Their operations include unethical business practices and unclear policies. Do NOT book with them. I fly 100k miles a year and this was my biggest travel mistake of all time - never will I ever book with them again.
Ethiopian Airlines is so money hungry that they continue to operate flights to/from China during the coronavirus outbreak. They are the ONLY African airline to not have canceled or suspended flights; thus, endangering the entire African continent from the deadly virus. Sad to see the largest African airline so inconsiderate of its people.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifer_s021,Jennifer wrote a review Feb 2020,Jennifer,"Shanghai, China",1 contribution,5 helpful votes,Shanghai - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r748303523-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,SCAM airline.

"The evening departure, transit via Addis and overnight into LHR suited my timings and worked well. The few hours sleep on the sector into London was pleasant and I arrived refreshed.

From the appearance of my fellow passengers who did the same trip in economy, I'm not sure they felt the same.

ET was also the cheapest business class I could find, yet the service was excellent.

Where they really stood out was on the return from London with a one hour delay that would make the connecting flight from Addis to Nairobi almost unachievable. Hours of worrying about when the next flight would be turned out to be pointless when ET staff were standing at the aircraft segregating the inbound passengers at Addis and guiding us onto bus for direct transfers to aircraft we would otherwise have missed. Ok, it's as much for their benefit as ours since they want to reduce the impact of missed connections, but it's left a strong feeling that ET really does make an effort.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/e7/b7/e2/robuganda.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobUganda,RobUganda wrote a review Feb 2020,RobUganda,"Entebbe, Uganda",41 contributions,48 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r747434973-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,I can't go back to economy,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"1. Our flight no ET 814 of January 12th 2020 from Kilimanjaro to Addis Ababa (a 2-hour flight) was delayed by 5 hours and we were forced to sit in the aircraft while it was being “repaired “ (whereas it’s was so easy to allow us to wait in the airport).  This resulted in a missed connection in Addis Ababa. 2. In Addis Ababa a hotel was offered (after a delay of 2 hours in the middle of the night). However, they did not hand over our bags, making excuses. This forced us to spend the entire night & next day in same dirty clothes. 3. With the bags in their custody, this allowed for coordinated pilferages from TWO bags. 4.

"I took this flight for the convenience and the luggage allowances. I agree with some of the negative comments about the In-flight service and in Addis if you going to get a domestic flight your luggage may not be getting delivered to final destination because in Addis sometime the custom holds your luggage back, and if you do not get a call or just go and check if they have come down the carousel, if not they get loaded on to the connecting flight. Its annoying as one of my luggage took five days to get it sent to Jimma because of custom in Addis want to charge duty for my personnel  electrical item. They will waste lot of time and the airliner is powerless do anything to get your luggage off customs. Be aware of  electrical items which they may charge duty but not much and also may delay getting your luggage back.Ground staff in Addis not very good for international passengers as they send you around in circle stupidly. As to the visa, please try to get it online rather than at the airport. Main terminal to terminal 1 there is shuttle service by Ethiopian airline but not many people aware off it and walks to the terminal 1, and its a long walk. Jimma ground staff manager Beniyam  is very good and very intellectual person he should be promoted in dealing with customer service, and he was so helpful to get my luggage and also re-booked my ticket back to London as I wanted to come back a week earlier, all other staffs. All other staffs I cannot say much, but in Addis one of the check in staff almost made me miss my connecting flight because of my hand luggage was too big for her eyes, but it was not and I was checked in from london all the way.and had no issues. She wanted to charge for my hand  luggage when I was trying to find my way to the connecting flight and she held on to my boarding card for a while unless I pay for it, but it was all a waste of time at the end, and she had to give my boarding card back. Ethiopian airline fly to so many places than most African or in fact Asian countries but ground staffs needs lot of training plus cabin crew. Food on board  was cold and watery and not tasty at all i must say. On-board wifi is good which you pay for it, which is not much. Take off and landing seems punctual and very good generous luggage allowances. Ticket are reasonably priced.I am frequent flyer to most other destinations around the world but I found Addis airport even it is expanding and busy airport but ground handling and information points etc are very poor. I am a experience traveler and i some how get by but for less experience and elderly there is not much help I can see a around.

"I am an Ethiopian decent so Et airline was my pride & joy. I make frequent trips to Addis to visit my family & I usually fly Ethiopian. Despite having the convenience of straight flights & good safety records, Ethiopian lacks so many key factors that make an airline great. The aircrafts asthetics usually look worn out, bathrooms are not kept clean on long flights, flight attendants look overworked & they're unattentive, the menu has remained the same for many years with choices of fish, chicken, beef served with pasta, bread. Crackers, side of sour couscous, butter, cheese & some runny yellow pudding for dessert. This high in carb meal lacks flavor & nutrients. Even though tickets are competitive with others Ethiopian airlines offers lower standard service. Management focuses on maximizing profit by flying to 100s of destinations around the world but has neglected key factors of the flying experience. Suggestions:Read your reviews on the internet-upgrade older planes interiors- more customer service training needed to on ground & inflight crew-change the menu please.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimisha16,Mimisha Ta wrote a review Feb 2020,Mimisha Ta,"Phoenix, Arizona",1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Washington DC - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r745845445-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,My last trip on Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was a trip via the Ethiopia as no direct flights to Entebbe from UK on any airline, so I'm always faced with a choice of routes. Ethiopian has proved to be a good choice. I've been other ways before with Kenyan or KLM but this one is my favourite so far for me. Firstly Ethiopian operate out of Terminal 2, Heathrow which is a good terminal. The Ethiopian airline staff are excellent, the baggage allowance of 23kg x 2 per person is fantastic, the price of the flights is low and the leg room for economy is good and the seats comfortable and the cabin is clean. The entertainment was very good on 3 out of the 4 flights, (on return leg first plane didn't have any, but not huge issue as that was a shorter flight) and had plenty of choice. On the day I flew out the plane wasn't crowded either and coming back with my family was easy despite my children being 2 years, and 11 months. They are fantastic with children and boarding is easy with them. Food choice was good too as a vegetarian they are very accommodating. Using Ethiopian meant the transfer was in Ethiopia rather than Kenya or Amsterdam and the new airport extension has literally just opened so it is beautiful to use for connections and the food choice there is great and free internet that works well too. I'll be using Ethiopian again for my future family trips to Entebbe and probably elsewhere in Africa if possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kushty500,kushty500 wrote a review Feb 2020,kushty500,"Crewkerne, United Kingdom",63 contributions,52 helpful votes,London - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r744842498-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Fantastic airline, great for this route",Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We travelled to Malaysia on a cricket tour with Ethiopian Airlines in December 2019 and our return flights were in January 2020.

Firstly their flights for this route was 20% cheaper than any of the other airlines, to be fair though this was 6 months before our departure.

To purchase tickets on their mobile app was slightly cheaper than purchasing online. The app was user friendly and actually quite easy to use.
Reserving particular seats at a later date was a nightmare though, and created some uncertainty because it gave an error message when trying to reserve seats.

The seats were comfortable enough and not bad, but nothing to write home about.

The service was good and staff were friendly.

Food was terrible though, we were a group of 40 people and not many of us ate all the meals.

The Airport was busy due to the time of year that we were traveling at, but there was no real bottle necks, or places where we had to wait in line for long periods. We were thankful for that. But the airport it self was not the most modern and the bathrooms were not in the best condition.

If I had to compare them with Emirates and Qatar Airways, and money was no object, I would not chose to fly with them again.

Overall, for the price we paid per ticket and taking into account the number of traveller's in our group, it was well worth it to travel with them for this particular trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741yusufm,Yusuf M wrote a review Feb 2020,Yusuf M,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",17 contributions,45 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Kuala Lumpur,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r744059459-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Affordable Airline,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight was more or less on time, and no board meal service was acceptable. No baggages were lost. IFE need improvements in the range of programs offered.

Seat , when extended has debris from earlier passengers, e.g. pieces of food and crackers, and the foot rest cover was coming off as magic tape was worn out.

"5 Feb 2020

My flight ET513 was delayed by more than 6 hours. When I arrived at ADD, I contacted with the ticketing officers. They provided me accommodation for 1 night, but I have several problems:
1) I also need my luggage. For 1 night, I have to clean up myself. Everything is inside the luggage. I have to wait for 2 hours minimum.
2) I don’t know how to go to the hotel. I am not a local person here. They cannot give me or take me to the bus.
3) I waited for 6 hours at JFK and also I have to wait my luggage for 2 hours. Overall, it is not my mistakes. It is the airline’s mistakes.

Finally, I fly with the business class and what I need. I expected that I could have more comforts and faster services. Totally, I spent my time for 1 day and a half for waiting stupid things.

Last two years, I flew with Airasina Airline. The flight was delayed by 3 hours. The staffs changed the tickets since I was a check-in counter at JFK. Also, they offered a hotel accommodation, but they waited me at the boarding gate when I arrived at the transit airport. They lead me to the hotel shuttle bus.

I don’t understand why Ethiopian airline has the service standards that is completely lower than other star alliance airlines. I have a lot of thing to to after I arrive my home. Now, I have to change my schedules. ET is making my life more difficult.

Please respect the time of the passengers. If you have more money, you could not buy the time.

"ITINERARY SUMMARY

Date: 18 June, 2019

Flight: ET901

Route: Addis Ababa - Lagos

Scheduled Departure Time: 9:00 am

Actual Departure Time: 9:21 am

Scheduled Arrival Time: 12:25 pm

Actual Arrival Time: 11:54 am

Equipment: Boeing 777-300ER

Flight Duration: 4 hours, 34 mins

CHECK-IN AND BOARDING

This was a group trip, so I didn't bother to check in online. We arrived the Bole International Airport Addis Ababa at 7:30 am, exactly 1 and half hours before the scheduled departure time of 9:00 am. That's not early enough for an international flight.

Pre-checkin security checks at Bole Airport was hassle-free. Check-in was timely and seamless as the Ethiopian Airlines check-in staff were very helpful and efficient. But sadly, due to not arriving the airport early enough, I didn't get a window seat which I wanted badly. As an aviation geek, window seats are always a delight for me. They allow me to 'pokenose' and observe the flight from a vintage position. Anyway, with my boarding pass, I proceeded to immigration and security and then to the boarding gate 20.

Boarding commenced by 8:25 am, 10 minutes later than the scheduled boarding time of 8:15 am. The boarding process was orderly as it began with Economy Class passengers with allocated seats in the zone 1 area of the aircraft cabin. That was followed by Economy Class passengers in zones 2 to 4. Lastly, Business Class passengers in zone 5 boarded. The 'zonal' boarding didn't only make the boarding process orderly and quick, it also made it easy for the crew to control the crowd. My seat was 24F in zone 4.

THE AIRCRAFT AND THE SEAT

The aircraft was a familiar type - a Boeing 777-300ER. This is the biggest aircraft type in Ethiopian Airlines fleet, only a couple of other African airlines operate the Boeing 777-300ER. After stowing my hand luggage in the overhead bin and locating my seat, the first thing I did was to look around and check out the aircraft.

This particular Boeing 777-300ER was configured in two classes: Economy Class and Business Class. As with standard Boeing 777 seat layout, the Economy Class cabin had a 9-abreast seating configuration in a staggered 3-3-3 layout. Business class cabin had a 7-abreast configuration in a 2-3-2 layout. This review will concentrate on the Economy Class. As an aviation geek, I 'pokenose' a lot, but I found the aircraft very clean and in good shape.

My seat was 24F, a middle seat in the zone 4 area of the economy class, just after the business class cabin. I really don’t like middle seats. (I already explained how I ended up in one). At a time when most Boeing 777 operators are going 10-abreast in the economy class, Ethiopian Airlines is one of the few international airlines that have retained the original, more comfortable 9-abreast configuration.

My seat felt quite comfortable. I didn’t get to measure the seat width and the seat pitch, but both looked and felt quite good, the leg room was very generous. Seat pitch was probably up to 32 inches, which is better than the industry standard. Another interesting feature on the aircraft was that each economy class seat had a USB port where passengers could charge their mobile devices.

THE FLIGHT AND THE CREW

We pushed back by 9:08 am, and took off by 9:21 am from runway 25L following a beautiful takeoff roll. The takeoff was gentle, and at a nice angle, we made a left turn and gently climbed to a cruising altitude of 36,000 ft above sea level. 

From takeoff in Addis Ababa to touchdown in Lagos, the flight was calm and smooth. It was a pleasant surprise to not have experienced even a minute of turbulence throughout the flight of almost 5 hours. The Boeing 777-300ER handled the flight very well, I found it to be very stable in the air. The professionalism of the flight crew must have been a factor too.

The flight was commanded by Captain Zerihun and assisted by Senior First Officer Lazarus. Both handled the flight very well. The captain's briefings were like a lady's underwear - short enough to be interesting and long enough to cover the subject matter. The Flight Attendants were extremely friendly and professional both on ground and throughout the flight. Generally, I found the Ethiopian Airlines flight crew to be highly professional and very friendly. A Flight Attendant named Tilaye, was particularly helpful.

IN-FLIGHT REFRESHMENT

To the relief of many passengers, in-flight meal service commenced quite early at 10:00 am with light refreshment, not long after takeoff. A variety of pastries and a choice of wines, juices, soft drinks and water were on offer for light refreshment. I went for puff bread, red wine and water. The bread was fresh, soft and tasty. And the wine, well tasted like wine.

Main meal service commenced at 10:15, options included white rice with beef sauce and white rice with fish sauce. For drinks, there was a choice of wines (red and white), fruit juices and soft drinks. I opted for the white rice with fish sauce, and it tasted really nice. Sides and desserts included puddings, chocolates, biscuits and bread.

Hot beverages including coffee and tea were also served. However, I didn't understand why we were served jollof rice as a side dish after offering us white rice as main dish. I personally thought that the jollof rice should have been some sort of vegetables or fruits.

IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

For in-flight entertainment, each economy class seat on the operating aircraft had a personal touchscreen monitor that could also be remotely controlled. The IFE system had everything for everyone including local and international movies, TV shows, documentaries, music, interactive games and a variety of audio channels.

The IFE featured Blockbuster, Classic, Asian, African, and Arabic, movies as well as KidsTV, ComedyTV, Drama TV, Discovery, Lifestyle, Brazilian, Indian, European, Star Wars.

Sadly, unlike on the outbound flight, my in-flight entertainment system did not work. Speaking specifically, while the videos played, the audio didn't work. The cabin crew attempted to reset the system a few times, but that didn't help. I still enjoyed the flight though despite the IFE challenge.

ARRIVAL

Following almost a 5 hour flight, we touched down at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos at exactly 11:54 am local time, a whole 30 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time. The landing was as smooth as silk, well, almost.

After the aircraft came to a complete stop, I made my way to the cockpit where I chatted with the Pilots before leaving the aircraft. The cockpit crew was warm and friendly.

SUMMARY

CHECK-IN: 97%

BOARDING: 95%

THE AIRCRAFT: 95%

THE CREW: 95%

THE FLIGHT: 98%

THE SEAT: 95%

IN-FLIGHT MEAL: 85%

PUNCTUALITY: 98%

FINAL VERDICT: In more ways than one, this flight was a nice experience. Apart from the in-flight entertainment that didn't work on my seat, every other element of the flight including check-in, boarding, in-flight meal service and arrival, were all on point. The ground crew was helpful and efficient while the flight crew was very friendly and professional. The aircraft was clean and in good shape. I found the seat to be quite comfortable and the economy cabin spacious enough. I must say that Ethiopian Airlines has some of the most professional crew in the world. They met my expectations and I will totally fly them again.

"This was a Dreamliner, a fancy plane with ‘mood lighting’ to help you adjust to the time zones you travel through, fairly spacious seats even in cattle class (in terms of leg room, this is one of the best I’ve been in). We were travelling with our six year old daughter, and the stewardess made friends with her at the entrance itself! Pillows in fresh new pillow slips, thin blankets in sealed covers, headphones, and the in-flight magazine had our child overjoyed, until she discovered the in-flight entertainment, which is pretty comprehensive: movies, TV, games, apps and more, in various languages. Even the flight safety instructions video is a creative one, cute and fun at the same time as it’s informative.

The flight to Addis Ababa is a six-hour haul from Delhi, and less than an hour into the flight, snacks were brought around. A little packaged savoury snack, looking like tiny doughnuts, was unimpressive, but my glass of passionfruit juice was lovely. They also offer liquor—later in the flight I had a tiny bottle of white wine. Barton & Guestier, not great but not terrible either.

Lunch was a mix of surprisingly good and pretty indifferent. In the non-vegetarian meal, there was a choice between chicken and mutton, and I chose mutton. This came in the form of a mutton curry, served with plain steamed rice and a mild spinach dish, similar to a creamed spinach. With that was a roll (somewhat dry), butter, crackers, cheese (processed), and a salad of sliced cucumber, tomato and a wedge of lime with a sachet of dressing on the side. While the mutton curry was delicious, full of flavour but not horribly spicy, the dessert was a disappointment: it seemed like pink Miracle Whip, topped with a few toasted almonds slivers. I had a few bites, and couldn’t bring myself to eat any more.

Service was adequate, efficient enough and accommodating of our child’s idiosyncrasies.the most pleasant surprise was that the stewardess brought our child a goodie bag after lunch: a delightful pouch containing a colouring set, a jigsaw puzzle, and a small stuffed toy. Our daughter was thrilled—she’s been with us on several international flights and has never received anything so wonderful. She loved it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/19/cd/d1/madhulika-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadhulikaL4,Madhulika L wrote a review Jan 2020,Madhulika L,"Noida, India",4253 contributions,259 helpful votes,New Delhi - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r742328276-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A very pleasant experience,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After the collapse of Thomas Cook I looked for cheap flights to South Africa from London. Ethiopian came up quickly and many reviews were good. I spoke to a friend who had had a good experience with them. It was cheap, I booked.

Website average.

Online check in a tad annoying.

It suggests printing out three copies of boarding passes, really?, it is 2020. (I used the boarding pass on my phone on the return with no problem).

Good communication via emails.

LHR efficient.

Airplane to Addis Ababa fairly new, clean, all ok. IFE ok, food quite nice, comfort level ok.

Staff very friendly.

Bole airport-simply NO. It seems that everyone has an angle to take your money. The shops are poor as is everything else. Toilets were clean.

Second leg to CPT ok.

The return was poorer, the food was very poor, dishes not warmed through sufficiently, past poor.

Drinks ok.

Bole airport again poor.

Staff very nice.

Ethiopian Air staff at Bole absolutely useless for many reasons.

I would, however, fly with them again if the price is right.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/4d/b6/c7/haldavies.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HalDavies,HalDavies wrote a review Jan 2020,HalDavies,"Smolyan, Bulgaria",601 contributions,377 helpful votes,London - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r742094981-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Average but cheap, so your choice.",Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Before boarding in Kenya they took away our CARRY-ON suitcases saying there was no space inside the plane to put the carry-on. They said the carry-on would be transported with the rest of the luggage. After getting to JFK the carry-on was missing and I had to fill a claims form. After a month of following up they said the claims form was missing so there was no way to trace the carry-on.  That's how i lost my carry-on with two phones, a tablet, a spare watch which was a gift, and really expensive sunglasses. The flight was more like a bus, dirty, things falling and squeezed.

"We flew from Chicago, IL to Mahe, Seychelles via Bole in Ethiopia.  The first leg of the flight was 14 hours on a newer 787, we had a 2 hour layover in Addis Ababa, then a 4 hour flight on a much older 737 to the Seychelles.  The check in process was quick and easy, the crew was polite, the food decent and the online entertainment system on the 787 on the first leg from Chicago to Addis Ababa was great.  The airport in Addis Ababa is undergoing work, but it needs major work.  Most of the international planes arrive in the morning and the best way to describe the process is organized chaos.  You plane and deplane via stairs on the tarmac.  A shuttle takes you to the main airport where all connecting passengers have to go through security again.  The airport itself needs work as the bathrooms could not accommodate the crowds, there were no areas to get food/water, and few seats.  Still, Ethiopian airlines runs a very efficient system getting people to and from the planes, etc.  Would fly them again to Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J222_psu,J222_psu wrote a review Jan 2020,J222_psu,"Chicago, Illinois",1371 contributions,294 helpful votes,Chicago - Victoria,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r741565706-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Good Airline, Bole Airport Needs Work",Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

﻿"When traveling we always call ahead to be moved into the bulk head seats as my husband has a spinal cord injury with a fused spine and needs the extra leg room to be able to stretch out in order to not get spasms and shake painfully throughout the flight which would be of discomfort to himself and other passengers.

The bulk head seats as per all airlines and written on Ethiopian Airlines website are reserved for passengers with these types of needs who require them, all that's needed is a phone call to customer services 24 hours before the flight.

To be safe, we called 2 months before and we were told that they can't do anything over the phone, we need to call closer to the time.

We called 2 weeks before and we were told that we need to do this at the airport when checking in on the day.

To be sure, we called 24 hours before checking and we were told that we need to be at the airport 24 hours before. Sorry WHAT?!?!

So we arrived at the airport 5 hours prior to check in, 8 hours before boarding, only to be told that they can't do anything now.

We eventually had the seats moved around and we got the extra legroom we needed for medical reasons, however when boarding the second leg of the flight the seat we had booked ended up not being a bulk head seat. Drama all over again. Can I just mention that they also lost my husbands wheelchair after the first leg so he didn't have it brought to him in the layover as requested which meant that he couldn't move around independently or use the restroom. We were also left on the flight for 45 minutes after all other passengers had departed, with no explanation.

After the journey we emailed customer services and got an apology and an assurance that for our return flight our bulk head seats have been booked all the way through.

When leaving Cape Town we were told at the airport that this has only been sorted for one flight and not the second. Does my husband suddenly not have an injury and the need for space halfway through our journey?? The Ethiopian Airlines manager made a point to say that we had done everything wrong (even though we had literally done what their website and colleagues over the phone had advised and well in advance), that I was brought to tears.

Because of the awful experience, when boarding in Cape Town to return to London we were told that as an apology we would get a business class upgrade but only for the second leg of the journey because the first leg was full. However when boarding the second leg, the manager in Addis hadn't checked his email and only when we told him what was arranged he checked and saw that we were to be upgraded. (this is 8 hours since receiving the email). Obviously then he had already sold the business class seats so no upgrade for us AND NO BULK HEAD SEATS.

When emailing the airline for an explanation after arriving back home, we received no apology, no explanation and no promise of further training their staff on customers needs.

All we got was 50% off our next flight in economy so that they can keep their reputation. And what, go through all this again?

"I flew Ethiopian during Christmas break from Addis to Cape Town and back. On my way back, the flight was highly overbooked, and around 10-15 people were denied boarding including me. I have the feeling they chose me because my flight was only to Addis, and since this destination does not belong to the EU or US, there's no legal costumer protection which means that one is dependent on the service by the Airline. The 'service' is as follows:

They offered me a hotel 50 kms outside of Cape Town, in an area so remote that I would not want to spend the night there. I urged for a hotel in Cape Town itself, but they could not offer me this. I decided to not accept the hotel, but was not given any compensation for this.

The only real compensation they offered me was a 300 dollar voucher for a next flight (which I wouldn't want after this experience), which turned out to be only 150 dollar if I wanted to have it cash. In Cape Town they told me I could get the cash on my arrival in Addis. After being sent to three different counters at Addis airport, it turned out I had to get the money in one of the ticket offices in town. I visited two of those, none of which had any dollars at that time. I only got my 150 dollar compensation at the third ticket office.

Ethiopian pretends to be the best Airline in Africa, but in my opinion doesn't deserve this title at all. That there is no legal protection for overbooked passengers does not mean the company should treat denied passengers like this. 150 dollars was not enough to cover my extra expenses for taxi's and another night in Cape Town - not even to mention the lost opportunities I had because of my delayed flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchtourist95,dutchtourist95 wrote a review Jan 2020,dutchtourist95,,2 contributions,3 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r738250608-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Acceptable carrier until you get denied boarding,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew Ethiopian Airlines in December from Singapore to Ethiopia then from Ethiopia to South Africa.
The aircrafts were spacious and the entertainment was perfectly fine however the service was poor and the food options in flight were very disappointing.

The airport in Ethiopia offers only a handful of options for food or drink and whilst we spent 4 hours in the airport, it seemed like chaos and it looked like it was still under construction. I would recommend that you prepare yourself with food, drink and a good book if you have to transit through this airport.

"On this trip we had 8 flights and all were on time. Their B787 is a great experience, the cabin was good even though they have 2 business class configurations. The one with the rounded seat configuration is better because the seat becomes real flat-bed with plenty foot area, the rectangular seat configuration is not real flat and the leg area is much crowded. Amenities were good and drinks were great. Cabin staff were nice and efficient but they do not kneel to speak to you and sometimes you do not hear what they say. They do not provide pijamas.

"This will be my first experience flying an African airline and I can say booking the flight was convenient and the cost was reasonable considering the time I got my ticket. I have no issue with the flight itself as there were plenty of spaces to actually stretch out as it wasn't a full flight.
My issue is with their partnership with Air Cote D'Voire, when I reserved my ticket, I wasn't told I will be needing another ticket for Air Cote D'Voire until I landed in Abidjan. Thankfully I had enough time between my flight. Due to language barrier, the staff that attended to me didnt tell me exactly what the issue was. When I was flying out from Lagos and pressed for time, first of all their Ethiopian airline staff came in late that Saturday morning, and I had to pay extra for an Air Cote D'Voire ticket so I dont miss trip to catch my connecting flight. I reported the issue and wrote plenty of emails and kept getting passed around and till today I got no refund for the new ticket I had to buy even after everyone agreed there was a mistake and I shouldn't have paid for a new ticket.
I will advise to be careful especially when flying with a partnered airline with Ethiopian airline as there is gray area on who should be responsible for what.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derind2020,dee d wrote a review Jan 2020,dee d,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,New York City - Lagos,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r737644013-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Decent Airline, terrible customer relations.",Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Cairo to Sao Paulo return via Addis. For a few hundred £s more than other airlines’ economy class fares, Ethiopian Airlines Business Class was great value for money in its own right but more importantly the service and experience were both excellent. I experienced both the older and the new Business Class seats on their Dreamliner aircraft and both were very comfortable. The service was very professional, friendly and efficient.

"Our flight in was lovely. We had a tv screen, it was clean and the staff were nice.

Then... first, our bag was completely destroyed flying through this airline from South Africa to Dublin and then a 4 hour delay on Addis flying back to South Africa in the worst conditions.

Our flight has been delayed by 4 hours with no updates on why or what will happen next and were not even allowed to go outside even though we have South African Passports! This, after the air hostesses were shouting ""this is an emergency, sit down, sit down"" on the airplane causing everyone to panic. We then got off the plane after it tried to take off 3 times, we then sat at the airport for 4 hours with no explanation as to why we have to switch planes.

Also fully reclining pods. Return leg was only normal seating and no personal TV so a little less impressive.

"We normally use Qatar Airways, Emirates when going to Asia, Philippines that is for the comfort and the lounges before connecting. This time, we tried the Ethiopian Airlines business class( cheaper than the two airlines and shorter flight). Dar to addis was comfortable, very few passengers so we could enjoy the whole place. Then landing in addis the nightmares start, the security check where other passengers don’t even have a clue how to fall inline together with their bags and bags of whatever, I thought each passenger have to have either one or two bags hand carry but these people they are hauling the whole supermarket. The staffs at the security checks are overwhelmed with these rowdy passengers. Then the cloud nine lounge, wow what a mess, overcrowded( flying midnight) so I get it, it’s rush hour. I think you modernize your toilets. Food, we didn’t eat anything just drank some water.
The connecting flight to Manila, at the gate it took them sometime to open it on time, so another wait. Business class was full, though I have to say for 14 hours flight choosing business class is a must, it was comfortable, staffs are friendly and accommodating, we were lucky not to have rowdy passengers. The only problem is the food, well I have to eat right it’s a long flight, I don’t normally eat airline food. So two hours after landing in Manila, diarrhea and vomiting, very unpleasant experience. I guess, you really have to be careful with the food they serve.
Coming back, the same thing, I had the whole Hongkong to Addis upset stomach, I should have learned and not eat at all..

Now landing again in addis, this time not crowded at all. The lounge was not crowded early morning.
Landing in Dar es Salaam came the problem,the ground staffs leading to the security check racial profiled us, the white lady passenger who was with us was not asked to show her yellow fever vaccination card at all,she’s even a tourist still have to apply for a visa. But us, even stopped us for sometime reading our yellow fever vaccination cards as if they are fake( we’re expats travelled the world with so many vaccines given by real doctors both from Europe, Asia,Kenya etc...) this ground staff lady has no clue at all it’s because we are Asians, she’s very racist. In Kenya and Ethiopia we’ve never been treated this way,only in Tanzania airport. At the immigration, was ok, with our residents visas.
Then the suitcases came 45mins after landing. Well, business or economy class, the same. If it’s not for the comfort of the seats I would not waste money flying business they treat you the same because I’m Asian, it’s only in Tanzania, I have felt that. Talking about racism there you go.

Yes, I’m ranting here, I’m supposed to only review the airline but yes, that was our experience here in this part of the world. Never we had a problem in Europe airports, nor Asia and the U.S., Kenya was so far the best experience we had in the whole East Africa region.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/c6/27/0e/igorotak06.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viatorem,Viatorem wrote a review Dec 2019,Viatorem,"Vienna, Austria",207 contributions,64 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Manila,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r735979392-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The longest flight.,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lagos is not the best of airports to travel through in any case but having to go through an additional security check, which requires one to empty all pockets - there are no scanners available at all - and be patted down rather unprofessionally, topped the negative experience.

"I've used Ethiopian Airways twice in November. The first was a flight from Brussels via Addis to Johannesburg, the second a flight from Johannesburg to Addis return. Both times the service was excellent. The flight from Brussels to Addis more comfortable than from Addis onward (nearly all intra-African planes are much less comfortable in my experience).
The airport in Addis is going through expansion - so travellers suffer, particularly when changing plane.
The duty free is a joke.

"Ethiopian Airlines provides newer planes, comfortable seats, and a kind competent staff, but only fair food, and on our flight, only one working bathroom. A second business class bathroom was out of order. But the real issue is that we paid for business class seats to ensure we would be provided services that are often taken for granted, in the expectation that – as experienced fliers – problems will occur. We were on an 8-day aid mission to Uganda starting December 16 and there were long dusty days ahead when we landed.  As we expected…of the three bags we checked in for the two hour flight from Addis Ababa to Entebbe, somehow only two bags came out of the conveyor belt.  Not only did the airline lose his luggage, which took hours to curate and spray with insecticide to avoid malaria on our rural journey, but we counted seven others in the cramped luggage services office filling out lost luggage forms on the same flight.  We stayed three more hours at the Entebbe airport for the next flight, thinking it might have been delayed, but it wasn’t on the flight either. And after four calls over the next two days, there was no sign of the bag and we had to move on. Needless to say, luggage services at the Entebbe airport (run by contractor NAS for all airlines servicing the airport) was quite unconcerned about out loss. There is no automation to record luggage inventory, everything is done manually in multiple ledger books, and research takes a lot of time. We completed our challenging journey with a group of 20 others, changing hotels every day and visiting gorgeous vistas contrasted with dirt poor poverty throughout the country. Upon return to the capital city, Kampala, we checked with NAS and were told that the luggage had been found and was being held at the airport.  But we arrived at the airport    (5 hrs earlier than our return flight because we know they are incompetent) to find that the luggage indeed been found after five days but then sent to our first hotel in Kampala, two hours away. We received delivery of the bag to our flight with 15 minutes to spare before boarding.  Total time spent waiting to track lost luggage? 5 hours.  So to recap we arrived / landed in Entebbe, Uganda on Dec 14 and received our luggage on Dec 23 just in time for our trip back to USA... (so all new clothes had to be acquired for the rural trekking in Uganda.) yes we did file a clein and will wait to see if it is honored for the expense of the clothing . The wasted time cannot be repaid. Wonder what it’s like for economy customers ? PS.

"Avoid this airline - even if you have to pay a few hundred extra dollars to fly on another. I recently flew more than 30 hours on Ethiopian and my impression is that they fall well below standards I have experienced with other airlines. Service was curt and occasionally rude and sometimes racist - during a layover I was filling in an immigration card that had been handed out and a flight attendant walked over, closed my table without asking and then told me there would be 'plenty of time later' to fill in my card later. Why hand out the cards so then??? A number of times when I got up to use the washroom or to get something to drink I was shooed back to my seat - why treat paying customers this way? The food was abysmal - the most processed food I've ever eaten on a flight. I asked for 'chicken' and received some meatballs tasking like styrofoam in goo and dry, rubbery pasta. This was served to us twice on a single flight! Seats were small and my neighbours were in my space for most of the flight. Entertainment system had very limited options. Boarding was chaotic because the flight attendants insisted on taking up most of the prime overhead storage space for their large carry-ons and then leaving it for the passengers to fight it out over the remaining space.

Current levels of service and comfort leave much to be desired.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jumeirah_Jack,Jay A wrote a review Dec 2019,Jay A,"London, United Kingdom",7 contributions,9 helpful votes,Toronto - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r734046168-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ghastly!,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My experience with this airline left very little to be desired. I don't think I'm an unreasonable person, and I seldom write reviews but I thought it prudent to share my experience so that future consumers will be well informed in the future when deciding what airline to use. My siblings traveled with Ethiopian Airlines to Ghana only to realize upon landing that none of their bags made it. As frustrating and disappointing that is, we took it in stride and set out to start the arduous, often frustrating process to find the bags. Staff at Ethiopian Airlines proceeded to give us the run-around, it was a relay race of person after person passing the buck with no one giving as a straight answer or being helpful in any way. After spending 6 hours talking to 8 different people from different countries we still don't know where the bags are and not a single person we spoke yo has been helpful about getting the bags to their final destination. All that is frustrating enough, but what led me to write this review is the customer service we received from the staff in New Jersey. They were rude, talking over us, and yelling. Then they proceeded to disconnect the phone while we were still talking. The guy on the phone did call back after to ask for the bag numbers, but the rudeness on the phone was uncalled for and disrespectful.

"We somehow got a  package with our cruise line, Norwegian-Spirit. We didn't know until a few days before the trip what airliines. We flew Air Canada to Montreal and then to Rome. No problems.

We caught the flight  and ended up the next morning catching another ET flight out of Addis Ababa.  That was to be an 8 :30 AM flight. It was about 30-45 minutes late. Then we stopped in Lome/TOGO. It was also late and we got to Houston about 8 PM. There were children running constantly in the plane and the stewardess didn't say a word. Very loud. The stewardess were nice but spoke little, if any English. By this time we had been up many hours with no sleep. At Bush no one was able to find our luggage.So we had to file a claim and those people didn't know what was going on and admited that were not fully functional. No kidding.

"When it comes to service on the aircraft, Ethiopian Airlines does great. But all their other services, such as airport services, customer service and online services are terrible.

At the airport there’s never enough places to sit and the staff isn’t always friendly! That being said they have improved greatly over the years and have WiFi everywhere.

By biggest problem is that the airlines adds destinations and stops. For example, on my way to Malawi, we stopped off in Congo!! We were NEVER sent an email and found out only when looking for our gate. I ended up getting to my destination late. The same as when I left again. I was scheduled to leave at 2ish in the afternoon but instead the flight departed at 4pm.

"Is it a bus or a plane?  Sometimes hard to say..read on for why.It was already going to be a heckish flight but the good news was that it was the shortest duration and least amount of take offs and landings to get from Geneva to Lilongwe Malawi.  Geneva to Rome to Addis to Lilongwe at around 20 hours.  Not great but the alternative routes were longer.  Of course booking seat assignments with the various Alitalia co-shares and other corporate complexities was difficult and  last minute ""ask at the airport"" but I am used to that now as part of business travel using the ""least expensive no frills beyond getting a pass to get on the plane"" tickets.  The old days when you could have an assigned seat were golden years and are long gone.The trouble started with an odd SMS text that said that my flight from Addis to Lilongwe would be leaving 10 minutes earlier but arriving an hour or so later. Hmm--nice of them to let me know but that seems odd.  Contacted my travel agent and they were unaware of what was up.  Spoke with Alitalia at airport in GVA and Rome and they were unhelpful--nothing on their computer as to why the delay.  Contacted Ethiopian in Addis and then I finally found out that they had added a stop in Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo!  And that they do this regularly!  Apparently they sell the flight without this regular stop in DRC and then add the stop after purchase to unsuspecting customers.  Most people would likely avoid yet another stop in DRC.  Thankfully it is not near conflict zones but still not exactly a place I wanted to touch down and spend an hour on the tarmac while they took on passengers and re-fueled the plane.Not going to go into service or the fact that one barbarian passenger decided to put his meal tray on the cabin floor near the emergency exits--it stayed there for an hour or so--thankfully others did not follow suit or the aisles would have been filled with trash.  Guess that's how they roll where he comes from--trash the public space with no thought of other people.Arrived in Lilongwe crushed and late, the hotel had given away our room at 4PM and we stayed in another nearby hotel.Contacted Alitalia and Ethiopian Air and they said the fine print says they can switch out equipment and land wherever they like.Perhaps true but felt like bait and switch to offer one flight and then add a stop in a different country that advertised.  Perhaps one time change could understand but my understanding is that they do this regularly to game the search engines.Shameful people but suppose anyway to make a buck.  Next time I will ignore the search engine results and use another airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jnelson_11,J N wrote a review Dec 2019,J N,"Rome, Italy",12 contributions,16 helpful votes,Canton of Geneva - Lilongwe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r732014461-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ethiopian/Alitalia Flight from Hell--Bait and Switch on route to Malawi--milk run via Lubumbashi DRC,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Since I was unable to find any way to request or buy extra legroom (I'm 6ft 4in tall with very long legs) we decided to upgrade to business class - something we have never done before and, in view of the ridiculous cost, will probably never do again.

Our outbound flight on an A350 was wonderfully comfortable and the crew were very attentive. We chose the front row, centre seats because the foot-well is larger on that row. The space advantage for my feet was fine but, when trying to sleep the flicker of light as crew moved through the galley curtain was disturbing. Food was good although not exceptional - one issue was that we didn't know which meal (of those shown in the menu booklet) was being served until the food arrived. The choice of drinks was very good.

Our second leg, on a B787, Addis Ababa to Victoria Falls, was similarly comfortable. Being in daylight, I had selected a window/aisle seat pair. The seats did not recline fully flat but this was not an issue for us. Food and drinks were as described above.

Our return to Heathrow via Addis Ababa began with a long leg of a circular route from Victoria Falls, via Gabarone, to Addis. This was on an old 737 and the seating was very similar to that provided in premium economy cabins today. Ethiopian Airlines we badly affected by the 737 MAX crash and subsequent grounding so the use of older aircraft has been necessary. Food and drinks were similar to those described above.

Our final leg, back to Heathrow, was very similar to my description for the first flight.

The lounges provided at Heathrow and Victoria Falls were very good. We did not have time to use the lounge at Addis outbound. We needed to use a lounge during our homeward journey since we had a 4 hour wait in Addis. The Cloud Nine lounge was a serious disappointment - it is huge but, when we arrived it was almost full. We eventually found two upright chairs. After some time a gentleman offered us a pair of comfortable chairs because he was leaving the lounge soon afterwards. We had a gin & tonic and there seemed to be plenty of food although we were already full from the earlier flight. We found it difficult to understand why a business class lounge, of that size, could be almost totally full - and that reception was still allowing more people to enter without seating to accommodate them. By midnight, many passengers had left and there was plenty of seating.

Our overall opinion was that, as indicated in the title, our experience was good but not very good, however there isn't an option for that on a 5-point scale. We certainly benefitted from the upgrade but at a cost equal to another holiday.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/63/3a/e9/timrandall.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timrandall,timrandall wrote a review Dec 2019,timrandall,County Durham,64 contributions,71 helpful votes,London - Victoria Falls,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r731775871-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Overall our experience was good but only because we upgraded.,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After reading multiple unpleasant reviews, where some felt superficial, I thought I would draw my own summary and experience of the airline, which WASN'T THAT BAD!

First prize: We arrived at all destination points safely-that was my biggest worry due to recent incidents.

The aircraft from CPT-Addis was a lot older and 'slightly overused inside' versus the aircraft from Addis to FR; however, it was still pleasant.

The food was particularly below average on all flights, which I would highly suggest they review and change.

The seats were comfortable and screens worked fine with adequate listings to view...its not Emirates, but it fills the void for screen time. My colleague had an issue with her audio that wasnt a highlight of course.

The staff were pleasant, with very friendly and helpful hostesses on the flight from Addis to FR.

Toilets were clean and adequate-I assume this differs between flights, I guess we were lucky with fellow travellers.

And lastly, the Addis airport is actually pretty cool and no different to other airports in terms of people etc. You can get bottled water, something to snack on and relieve yourself at decent ablution facilities.

If you want a pleasant well priced flight, I would suggest this airline.

Safe travels!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ash-RSA,Ash-RSA wrote a review Dec 2019,Ash-RSA,,16 contributions,26 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Paris,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r731738137-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Pleasant,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am Asian, and travel from Tanzania to Cairo, and my friend was intended to go to Singapore. And the staff ask us to show the leave ticket from our destination. I explain to them the itinerary was subject to change and we can assign some form to take the responsibility to ourselves. Those two countries, one we use visa on arrival, the other one we don't need visa at all.

The staff didn't accept that and insist that we should buy ticket on site. And the ticket from Africa to far-east is not cheap, but they didn't care about that,and those countries are not islands. We also can leave from land border. After we showed tickets to them, they asked us to show our hotels booking details in our destination further. I don't know what is point of that. When I arrive Egypt, the custom asked me NOTHING at all! I felt the staff at airport are quite malicious.

The toilet was quite dirty. The flight only 2hours. I went to toilet after 1hour from taking off, and the trash can stuffed all tissue.

"Ethiopian Airways Edinburgh to Lilongwe

There were three legs to this flight with the first leg being provided by Flybe from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Although the flight was on time and most aspects were as I would have hoped what I find really annoying is that the carry-on allowance for this leg of the flight is limited compared to the second two stages of the flight.
I have found that over the last few years the quality of service provided by Ethiopian Airways has continued to improve while costs appear to have reduced. (November 2019 £752.05) They offer the same choice and quality of food as other carriers on this route and the in-flight entertainment is reasonable although do not expect up-to-date movies.

When transiting at Heathrow and Addis Ababa arrival and departure was from the same terminal which makes things easier but do check this before departing. This is particularly helpful because on both the outward and inbound flights you have to collect boarding passes at Heathrow. Although the flights that I have taken have been quite busy the boarding process has been swift and sometimes completed ahead of schedule.

"We traveled as a TV-crew, bringing lots of camera and sound equipment, it was all paid for and made clear before arriving at the airport. At the airport we had to wait in line for between 1-2 hours because they said they could not send the equipment and could not find the payment and reservation in their system. Our coordinator had to show them all the papers, and it was still a problem.

The plane we flew was old, but the worst thing was the seats. They are very hard and uncomfortable, making it unable for me to sleep on the long trip, it also gave me back troubles the next day.
There were no individual air, so no way to control temperature.
I have food-allergies, and they could not help me get some special food, which I also could not pre-book through their app.

When we were leaving Cape Town, we didn´t get to leave on our departure date, because they had overbooked the plane with 80 seats. Even though we had booked our tickets months in advance.
They could not give us any information, on why this had happened. But we heard that there was a switch of planes, but we didn´t get any information, they could not book us to other airlines not even the ones in Star Alliance.
We stayed at a hotel for the night, after 5 hours at the airport, we got one meal included at the hotel...
The next day when went back to the airport, we still had not got´n our tickets. When we finally did get them, people (including me) who had pre-booked special seats, did not get the same seats, so we had to argue for more hours to get it, because that was ""a big problem"" for them to fix.
Same bad flight from Addis to Oslo.
We had been given vouchers for 300$ to fly Ethiopian again, or they told us that we could trade for 100$ in money, but no information were given on HOW to get the money. So none of us did.

"Our outbound trip (LHR-ADD) went without a hitch. For our return trip, however, the first hint there was a problem was when the boarding passes wouldn't download, or email, or anything. On arrival at ADD it was chaotic, as the new terminal is built but the infrastructure isn't really in there yet. We had to go to the 'special requests' queue to get our boarding passes...eventually...
So to the flight, which was ready on time, boarded in orderly fashion - one of the few airlines I have ever seen turn away 'chancers' who try and jump their boarding group number! We departed on time.
It took ages for them to come and serve us breakfast, which given it was an 8.40 departure meant lots of hungry stomachs. And this was where we discovered that though the airline had picked up the special meal request for the outbound flights, and we had specifically checked it had been applied to all flights, that they didn't have our dietary need down. And tried to say breakfast was ""vegetarian"" when it had a (meat) sausage in the middle of it. A vegetarian meal was located, with ill grace, ""I know what's on my manifest"" (yeah, but your manifest is wrong, that's what is being pointed out to you), and duly served. When our main meal was served, about 90 minutes out from Heathrow, the same crew member did remember, and again found a ""spare"" meal. Funny - it was the very Asian Vegetarian meal that had been requested, and evidently the link between the meal and the seat had been lost somewhere along the way.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/2c/60/ab/snowythepyro.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowythepyro,snowythepyro wrote a review Dec 2019,snowythepyro,"London, United Kingdom",488 contributions,186 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r731612626-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Chaotic checkin but lovely meals - if they don't lose your special order,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It's an Ethiopian air only lounge, so i guess the quality is also defined by the airline and it was already poor before we even started our flight.

The checkin for business is on a different gate then marked on the boarding pass since for some reason they want business class passenger to board last on the plane. Boarding was chaotic since all business flights had to go through the same gate.
The plane it self was an old seating 2 -3-3 in business, no possibility to charge a device.
The food was poor and the inflight entertainment was unbelievable bad. I ve not even seen so poor choices in the economy class of other airlines.

"In November 2019, I flew 25,000km by Ethiopian Airlines to visit Addis Ababa, Kigali, Cape Town and Entebbe across Ethiopia, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda in 11 days. The airlines' efficiency is reasonable, staff is friendly, flights were mostly on time, and the aircraft are well maintained. I travelled by their latest DreamLiner for four segments of my itinerary (New Delhi-Addis-New Delhi, and Addis-Jo'burg-Addis).
However, I find their food and drinks boring and repetitive. They should consider offering different food menus and drinks at least twice or thrice a week so that passengers using the airline continuously during a specific period of time do not have to eat the same rice and lentils (vegetarian fare) and drink insipid white wine!

"Flight Oslo-Addis Ababa was ok, but did not like the transitt stop in ARN/Stockholm both ways! One ways is fine, but not both ways. Despite good rates, flying from Oslo should give passengers more Eurobonus pionts! Food onboard was medium good and legspace was normal for economy class.
We were informed the week before flying, that the flight from Addis to Lilongwe now will have a transitstop in Lumumbashi, Congo... A bit late, but we only had to accept this. This made us have to contact the transfercompany to inform them that we would arrive over an hour later... This change also made it impossible to check-in online !!!

Inflight movies was deficient and not very good! The earplugs was just uncomfortable to wear. The seatcovers were worn and well used - looked old and felt outdated.

Our returnflight from Vic Falls also had a transitstop, in Gabarone, Botswana -- That meant that we had to fly southwest, to go north again towards Addis.
On my next overseas travel I will prefer another airline !

"The airline and onboard services were much better than expected especially on the Boing 787 from Cairo to Addis Ababa. The smaller aircrafts (used from Addis Ababa to Antanavarivo) were much more worn and must less leg room space.

However, the problem of using this airline is that you have to go through the Addis Ababa airport to switch flights and that was a chaos. Huge waiting lines, no space for all passengers and serious problems with ground transport operations (buses).

On our return flights, things were much calmer at the airport with much less traffic and we had no problems. Food served was good too.

"I am travelling to Mombasa on Christmas day and have a 18 hour layover in Addis Ababa.
Is it better to book my own hotel for the layover or wait till I am there and customer service desk find a hotel.
The hotels offer a shuttle bus are these reliable?
As a single women travelling are there any concerns that I should know about.
Finally, any information about Ethopian Airlines, first time I am travelling with them, is the food ok, or should l buy something at Heathrow, are refreshments free?

"I booked Ethiopian Airlines because (a) they were the cheapest at the time, and (b) they fly into Cape Town without having to go via Joburg.  Having to change from International to Domestic at OR Tambo is the biggest pain the rear imaginable, especially after having flown for many hours beforehand.  So to avoid ORT if you are heading for CPT is a bonus. Ethiopian used the Airbus 350 for the LHR-ADD sector and an older 777 for the ADD-CPT log.  Both were OK.  The flight was at least reasonably comfortable and the food was better than last year.  The staff do seem a bit inexperienced sometimes, but overall everything was fine.  Timings were very good; the only potential negative was at Bole in Addis where the queue for security was horrendous - several hundred people waiting in line, but they got the Cape Town passengers to queue-jump and we were all fine.  Additionally, you can take up to 2 checked bags each up to 23 kg.  I travel fairly light but if you do have a lot of baggage then its a good option.Overall not a bad experience as they go.  If the price is right and the timings the same then I'll use them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/f5/67/01/vasbyt-londen.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vasbyt_Londen,Vasbyt_Londen wrote a review Nov 2019,Vasbyt_Londen,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",6 contributions,14 helpful votes,London - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r724718933-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Good, cheap, efficient travel",Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I fly around 10 business class flights a year, Ethiopian Airlines is trying but failing.  On the outbound flight from Manchester the Lounge was sub-Wetherspoons.  Very poor choice of food and drink, not comfottable at all.  The seats (3A & C) on a 787 Dreamliner were OK during the day, but don’t recline to flat bed, if you are tall, you won’t be able to sleep on your side, as the metal footrest coincides with your ankle.  Also the 2:2:2 configuration means that the person in the window seat has to climb over you to use the WC – not very Business Class!  Food was OK, wine selection reasonable, amenity kit average, but the seats aren’t good enough.The entertainment system is grim, compared with Middle Eastern airlines.  There was almost no choice of music and what there was appears to have been selected by someone with zero knowledge.  The headphones are NOT Noise Cancelling - unlike most other airlines, so hearing the audio over the engine noise was difficult.  Another area where they need to seriously up their game.Cloud 9, the so called Business Class Lounge in Bole Airport is appalling.  When we arrived, there were no seats available & all tables were taken, people were sat wherever they could – it was as far from comfortable as you can imagine.  We had to wait until passengers had left to nab their seats.  The western food selection was uninspiring,, the Ethiopian selection better.  The bar is terrible, only one red wine and no rum.  I even went to duty-free to buy a bottle, but once you enter the airport your birr are worthless!Would we fly again?  No, not even if someone else was paying.  It is worth paying more to fly Emirates via DXB.

"I was a bit dreadful to fly Ethiopian, as I will admit I heard some terrible stories. we also flew with our 1 year old so regardless we were dreading the flight. However we were more than pleasantly surprised with the airline. al of our flights ( we had a connection) were on time, in new Dreamliner airplanes with plenty of legroom and excellent entertainment system. the deck crew were very professional and upon check-in, they also blocked off available seats for us so we were able to have a row for ourselves with the baby, which was absolutely fantastic.
The airport in Addis is a slum but we had very short layovers and all flights were prompt on time so we really had a pleasant time.
I will say that the food isn't too brilliant I have had better, but no one expects good meals on commercial airlines.

"the plane landed with delay in Dar (coming from Mauritius). After 3 delay announcements, the plane was declared non operational and the flight cancelled. the whole operation took 4 hours, waiting in an outrageously empty new terminal of Dar, enjoying the noise from the building work. a miserable meal was offered after 3 and 1/2 hours of wait, with no information on the likelihood of getting on the flight. Finally they started sending us to the hotel but many did not have anymore a valid visa as the whole process expanded to the next day (was a late night fly). the Airport crew was completely lost, unable to manage the situation, baby crying and frustration from lack of communication. They disappeared several times to get their meal, but we were not dignified of similar attention. finally with people half way out of the airport they opened the boarding (!). the problem was  that we all missed the connecting flight in Addis already and we were proposed to take the same flight 24 hours later, with no visa for getting to Addis and having to stay the wole time in the transit area. I manage to get a Turkish Air lift to my final destination, much better.

"We spent 17 days in Ethiopia without our luggage, no one offered help, the first aid kit stated in their site was not offered, we were sent from one luggage room to another, total we visited some 10 of them, some more than once. 3 suitcases were late the first day, 2 disappeared completely. They offered 75 dollars for the 3 instead of 75 pp, and now they offered 840 dollars in compensation based on fictitious weight of the suitcases, which together with the contents are evaluated at least six fold, disregarding the uncomfort we had, or the amount we spent to buy minimal needs on site.

We had four Ethiopian flights on this trip. I was going to give them a good rating until flight 3. We have carry on luggage but because it was a small plane and a 50 minute flight we decided to check it. Big mistake. Our luggage was not put on our plane. Not because they lost it or because we were late checking in but because they decided the plane would be overloaded. We and about 15 other passengers didn't discover this until we were in Addis Ababa and no luggage. They told us it would be on the next plane which didn't show up for 3 hours.

"RT TLV-CPT,4 flights,via Addis,3 on 787 Dreamliner ,and one on 777-300.
Flat beds is what I'm after ,and ET sells them for a reasonable rates to Africa.Thats why I use ET a lot.However service and food leaves much to be desired.
Crews are gentle and polite,but service is ridiculously slow,taking presious sleep time on late night flights or early morning flights.
They don't have menues on many times,or hand you a dirty used one.I saw the girls collecting the menus after the flight for reuse.
Sometimes they forget to service you at all,especially at night when they assume ( and hope) everyone is asleep.I had to call them and ask them 'where is my food'...they apologized saying they thought I was asleep.Thats what happens when the crew does not greet you or discuss dinning options with you on late flights when you board.

Very impersonal service,they don't use your name,and many times forget to collect dirty dishes ,especially from desert services...it seems that after 80% of the service process their battery is dead.I had to bring it myself to the galley.

Their 777-300 is awful with 2-3-2 configuration in Business,imagine being in a middle seat while paying Business fares.An outdated Business class,but I guess they will never change it,as the 777 are getting old,and new planes come into service.

In the mean time passengers who paid thousands of usd must accept thus subpar Business Class.The Dreamliner are much better,but still overall service is lacking,and food quality is 2or 3 on a scale of 1-10.

Their crews also do not monitor the exclusivisty of Business Class and Economy Class passengers keep coming in to use the bathrooms,creating waiting time that should have never been allowed to happen.

It's very hard to be upset with the crew as they are so gentle and polite,but ET must up their game.Unfortunately it won't happen,as they were smart enough to create a monopoly in Africa,and many times only ET can take you where you need to go.
But as I said,I'm after my flatbed,and the rest is an extra,an extra that ET delivers in a very poor manner.
Their hub Bole airport is a mess too,never looking forward their endless security lines,where fast track is not manned,and Pushing and shoving is the norm.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafi550,Rafi550 wrote a review Oct 2019,Rafi550,"Tel Aviv, Israel",48 contributions,42 helpful votes,Tel Aviv - Cape Town Central,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r721673359-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Poor Business class product.,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian airlines is working to become Africa's predominant airline, and by that to compete with Turkish airlines. They are growing to fast, as the planes are old (and musty), service is horrendous, and the food is inedible.
The flight attendance always feel like they are afraid of the passengers and dont know how to handle sticky or rough situations. I dont trust they will know how to control the passangers in a case of real emergency.
This flight is a night flight, so when I board it (i make it often) I ask 3 different attendants to NOT wake me up for meal. They always do (with one blessed exception). they are so adamant to serve meal, because that is what they are required to do, that they wake you up in a very aggressive manner.
I have been making this flight twice a year in the past 3 years. for the entire time, the meal has not changed once and is always a wilty bean salad and a mushy meat entree. Nothing to be woken up for.

"It was our first flight in Ethiopian Airlines. The flight to Adis was in B/C and the leg to Seyshelles was in E/C so we had all the range of service.
The flight was on time. The crew is verey nice and helpfull. The seats at the B/C is O.K. It depends what airplane you are flying. the food was good.

"We flew with this airline,4 flights in total,and both outgoing and returning journeys I found the cabin crew to be the most miserable and unfriendly I’ve ever come across! But what shocked me the most was that on the first long flight of our outbound journey,my husband became really quite ill. He was unable to get to the toilet because he felt on the verge of passing out so unfortunately had to use the ‘discomfort’ bags. When a member of the cabin crew passed,we politely asked for some more and she abruptly said they’re in front of you! When we explained we’d used them,she rolled her eyes then came back and virtually threw one at my husband! Never asked after his welfare or if he needed water or anything! Whether she assumed he’d been drinking I don’t know,but that’s not the point! He hadn’t and I was distressed because I thought he was seriously ill,but they couldn’t have cared less. I suggest the airline might make better provisions to ensure better customer relations/care/service. Air travel isn’t cheap and when travelling long haul I’d at the very least expect service with a smile! Shan’t be in any hurry to use this airline again I’m afraid!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquis695,Jacqui S wrote a review Oct 2019,Jacqui S,,15 contributions,7 helpful votes,Manchester - Victoria,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r721254598-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Miserable!,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I decided to fly Ethiopian airlines for the first time having read good things about her new fleet. The outbound journey went quite well for the most part, despite the 55 minute layover at Addis Ababa.The return leg was where it all went awry. First, the plane that was supposed to take us to Addis Ababa arrived late, and as a result, by the time we got to Addis,  the connecting flight to Doha had departed. It took several minutes for us to realize this due to the chaos we met at Bole airport when we arrived.After asking around, we were told that we were going to be booked into a hotel inside Addis Ababa till 7pm the following day.We then had to queue for over an hour with others in apparently the same situation, to obtain a visa before being taken by the hotel shuttle to our hotel. We also learnt that instead of going straight to Doha, we would be going first to Kuwait before proceeding to Doha! The hotel was okay for the most part, but the bedsheets did not look that clean, the single bed was very narrow, and the mattress was just too soft.It was also quite cold and there was no heater. We were provided 4 meals, however; 2 dinners, 1 breakfast and 1 lunch.The following night we were taken back to the airport and it was after we had gone through the security checkpoint at the entrance that we were told, on asking, that we  had to exit the main airport building and go somewhere to the left of it. So we did that, but on asking someone else we we were told that we were at the wrong place and to completely leave the airport grounds and then turn left after doing so. So with two hand luggagge each we started walking out of the airport grounds and turned left on to the open road with no streetlights and walked for at at least 2.5kms, before finally getting to the part of the airport where our terminal was located. I have NEVER been in an airport where one cannot go from one part of it to the other indoors or at least with an airport shuttle to take one there. Why did the hotel shuttle not drop us off there at the outset?We then went through two more security checkpoints , one on the ground floor and the other on the upper floor before finally getting to the waiting area of our boarding gate.The plane that took us to Kuwait was very clean and for me, had the most attentive and pleasant air hostesses of all legs of the journey. There was one in particular (  unfortunately I don't remember her name) that really impressed me. This plane however was the most uncomfortable by far, with the worst leg space and worse still, no individual entertainment screens for a 5 hour flight! It had  only one small screen for about 3 rows of passengers with no choice of programmes; we all had to watch the movie that was put on whether we liked it or not. So were on this cramped flight, bored silly, for 5 hours.When we arrived at Kuwait, there was no one to guide us as to how or where to go about getting seats on the Qatar Airways flight that was to take us to Doha. After walking up and down the airport at Kuwait, we finally found the stall where we were given boarding passes. The flight to Doha finally left about 2-3 hours after we arrived and after we had gone through yet another security check.On getting to Doha, we discovered after waiting at least 2 hours at the carousel for them, that our check-in luggage (11 of them)  had not arrived with the flight. On inquiring about their whereabouts at the airport help desk, instead of filing a formal report of the missing luggage, they couldn't even tell us where our luggagage were, nevermind when we could expect their arrival. We asked for Ethiopian airlines office at the airport in the hope of filing a report. We went there, saw no one  (the doors were all locked) and learnt theat they had all left after the arrival of an Ethiopian airlines flight earlier that morning.When we got home, we started writng and making calls to every Ethiopian airlines email addresses and phone numbers respectively both locally and at their Addis Ababa head office, that we could find. However, NONE of their representatives on any media could tell us where our luggage were and when they would be delivered. Note that we had securely attached a tag containing a name,email address, and final destination, to  every single one of these luggage. They all also refused to open a formal report and provide us a reference number. 10 out of the 11 luggage arrived the following day even though we were informed that all 11 had arrived. It hen became a herculean task to get anyone to respond to our enquiries about where the last bag was and when it would arrive. No could or would tell tell us despite several call, emails, WhatsApp messages to several people both locally and internationally for several days. Note that the 11th bag was excess luggage which we had paid $240 in excess baggage charges for.We were finally informed 16 days (31st Aug) after we arrived that the last bag had been located and to come and collect it, despite the fact that we had informed them beforehand  that this luggage contained only perishable food. On getting there, the luggage had been put into 2 clear large plastic bags, probably to mask the odour that must have emanating from it. Of course, as was to be expected,  everything had gone bad.Hence, we formally filed and submitted a compensation claim to several people including the Ethiopian airlines Customer Service supervisor for Qatar, Wolid Al Medani. The latter responded the following day (Sept 1) acknowledging the receipt of the claim and writng that he would ""check and revert"". However, almost 2 months and several reminder emails later, neither he  nor no one anyone else from Ethiopian airlines has bothered to respond.I really wanted to support this African airline but after this experience, I certainly will not be taking Ethiopian airlines anywhere except maybe on a direct flight to Addis Ababa; I liked the little I saw of the place and hope to visit again, one day. I hope Ethiopian airlines will get their act together soonest. Their very short layovers for international flights seems to be where the main problem lies.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laolu,Laolu wrote a review Oct 2019,Laolu,"Toronto, Canada",3 contributions,5 helpful votes,Doha - Lagos,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r720979766-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,High Expectations that Ended in Terrible Disappointment,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Total and absolute disaster. We bought our tickets from Istanbul to Buenos Aires with a stop in Addis Ababa. When we bought it, it was a 3 hour layover.

Next day, when we were on the plane ready for departure, they had a technical problem, we had to change planes. 5 more hours delay. We arrived to Buenos Aires 60 hours after departing from Istanbul.

"I had flown this airline before and it went well but this flight to Istanbul was terrible. The seats were uncomfortable and it felt like there was no legroom or any space. It's a 5h 30 mins flight and there were only two toilets on-board. Someone was in my seat and I specifically asked for an aisle seat but because we were close to taking off (our connecting flight had just landed), I had to get to my seat quickly and ended up sitting by the window. There was no individual entertainment, they had pop-up screens playing kiddie movies and I didn't receive earphones.

"First time flying with this airline and I was pleasantly surprised. The flight was on time and the staff were friendly. They gave a lot of food, but I requested vegetarian and there seemed to be a misunderstanding about my meal. I couldn't eat some of it since the veggies were spicy and I don't think it agreed with me. The entertainment was great too but I noticed that not everyone had earphones and they had to request them. I don't think the earphones were super comfortable either, after a few hours, they started hurting my ears and I struggled with the sound and couldn't hear very well. There were also no blankets and we had to request them if we wanted them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMasoet,NMasoet wrote a review Oct 2019,NMasoet,"Cape Town, South Africa",29 contributions,24 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r719335724-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Enjoyable flight,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We flew with our whole family. it was not the newest airplanes. Some of the tv screens did not work properly. Also the remote is on the chair arm rest and sometimes when you are watching tv your neighbor presses your remote per accident. VERY ANNOYING!! THEN YOU HAVE TO SELECT YOUR MOVIE AGAIN AND CONTINUE.Only one flight was in a new airplane. The seats was not the most comfortable in comparison with other airlines. The airport terminal in addis was chaotic. First they changed the gate with very late notices. The airport is new but still needs better info and people flow structure.  We just made it for our connecting flight. The airport shops are hell expensive. We chose Ethiopian airline because of flight duration.

"Just off a flight from Addis Ababa to Bangkok. I can’t begin to describe the level of indifference by the cabin crew. They never smiled. Made it quite clear they were at “‘work “ and never engaged with the passengers in any meaningful way. The crew member serving me, shoved her butt in my face when speaking to another passenger across from me, never smiled, was inaudible and then spoke poor English. During the safety video she lent on wall looking bored. Later I saw her in the galley with back to the passengers looking out the window. When someone told her the toilet paper had run out she looked blank ! When leaving the plane she did not say goodbye to anyone ? New planes yes, renovating and updating airport yes . Service ? Non existent ! I can’t believe they are the biggest airline in Africa.

"I had a long layover in Addis Ababa coming home from Egypt (I specifically arranged it this way, they offer a free hotel and transport into the city so you get a full bonus day of sightseeing!!!!) After my day of touring around Addis Ababa, I returned to the airport and  enjoyed a couple of hours in the lounge (I had used points to upgrade to Business class -SO worth it!!!). Awesome food ... and they regularly hold traditional Ethiopian Coffee Ceremonies. Incredible coffee and such a cool experience in the lounge. The flight itself was extremely comfortable with excellent attention by the flight attendants. The seat configuration on the 787 dreamliner made business class roomie and easy to get some sleep as the flight was extremely long.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenae_and_her_boys,Jenae N wrote a review Oct 2019,Jenae N,,12 contributions,12 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Chicago,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r718944337-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Service, Comfort and GREAT COFFEE",Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'd used Ethiopian before domestically, and liked them a lot. I chose them for a recent celebratory trip to Israel with my elderly mother. What a disaster. Two days before departing from Johannesburg, I was informed that the flight would now depart 6 hours later. I specifically chose them because of the short layovers and convenient departure times, because of my elderly mother. After connecting, we would now arrive in Tel Aviv at 4 am instead of 8 pm the night before. I'd pre-paid a shuttle in Tel Aviv too, which at that point could still be informed of late arrival, because they had the flight number. What they didn't do, was rebook our connecting flight! When I checked in on-line the connecting flight simply wasn't there! I called the call centre again and the agent, Pawlos, had the cheek to say he'll rebook me, but that's my free change gone! After they changed the flights!

That was only the start of our misery though. After sitting out the connecting time (which was now much longer than when I originally booked) in transit in Addis, they bumped us off the flight at the boarding gate during the boarding procedure! Just the two of us, my 75-year old mother and me, after midnight! They had overbooked our seats! I pointed out to haughty Megnot, the 'supervisor' that I could see there were two other seats available on that flight still and we should get them, but she said they were for crew! Why not bump the crew and serve your passengers, who had perfectly valid boarding passes and were now already seriously delayed?

The very same thing had happened with the flight before ours, which departed from the same gate for Washington. There was a massive commotion as one family of 7 (there were many more passengers who had been bumped off that flight, but the 7 drew a lot of attention) was also bumped. It turned into a terrible commotion with them eventually bursting through the doors to the skybridge, which had already been closed for boarding, screaming and swearing, then some running back while others ran back onto the plane again, and so on. At no point did the ground staff even call security or the police. This carried for a good half hour, and was quite concerning to witness. Little did we know the same fate awaited us...

We were then shooed all the way back to the transit area, with no offer of a golf cart or anything for my mom who was struggling to walk all that distance, to a dingy office where there seemed to be much activity but very little progress. We were told by that same snooty Megnot that we would be rebooked on the 2pm flight the next day, but ultimately we were only on the 16h35 flight, which on the day was also delayed until after 19h00!! In the meantime we had missed our shuttle, our first night in Tel Aviv, a very expensive destination, and had suffered terrible disinterest from any staff member. Not one word of apology or help or compassion whatsoever. Yes, they put us up in their hotel for the early morning, but how does that compensate for an experience like this? There are no lounges at the airport one can access unless you have some frequent flier status with Star Alliance, even if you're willing to pay, or are a member of Dragon Pass etc. and an organic juice costs you an eye-watering USD 7 a glass outside!!!!

I asked for assistance in Addis to get a letter to confirm the delay for insurance purposes, and was told to contact the office in JHB because that's where the journey started. Like a fool I fell for that, and of course there was no sign of Yohannes yohannesy@ethiopianairlines.com at the JHB office, and a woman gave me his address promising he'd help me when I sent an e-mail. Needless to say, 4 emails and almost a month later, no reply or assistance of any kind.

Their conduct and lack of assistance to remedy a situation they caused is disgusting, and I will never, ever fly Ethiopian again, that's for sure. I'm sure when things go well with your trip with them, you will love them, but when it goes wrong, it goes very wrong. Avoid them in case that's your bad luck too.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/97/cf/e2/harveycapetown.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarveyCapeTown,HarveyCapeTown wrote a review Oct 2019,HarveyCapeTown,Cape Town,470 contributions,469 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Tel Aviv,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r718218046-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"TERRIBLE, CHOOSE ANOTHER AIRLINE FOR YOUR OWN SANITY",Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'll keep this short. Some flight attendants don't know how to smile, others are great. Addis Ababa airport is chaotic but functional. Aircraft are clean and modern, all good there especially the A350, which is super comfortable. But the meal service is confusing in that requested special meals are not delivered, despite being ordered in their website and acknowledged in the flight details. The flight attendants walk down the aisle and ask ""chicken or fish"" and when you tell them you had a vegetarian meal booked then they go and find one somewhere. Otherwise, meals are the same thing I've been eating on mainstream airlines for the last 23 years. Good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall, I'd fly them again (in fact I'm about to), but I hope they sort out their meal service and especially I hope they sort out Addis Ababa airport's chaos soon, especially the security check/x-ray screening, which is the most chaotic I've ever experienced.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pruritus-ani,Leopold H wrote a review Oct 2019,Leopold H,"Bairnsdale, Australia",16 contributions,8 helpful votes,Bangkok - Lilongwe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r716063821-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good but needs improvement,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We decided to give Ethiopian Airlines a try.  It is a LONG flight from Tanzania to Washington.  Plane was packed and had plenty of crying babies.  But that's to be expected.  What's not expected is stained seat cushions, uncomfortable seats and dreadful food.  We did think there was a bit more legroom than the average flight.  We got meatballs for every meal.  And they were not very good.  Crew needs to pay more attention to keeping the bathrooms clean.  Who knows why, but many passengers did not flush the toilet after use - perhaps they need signage in Swahili in the bathrooms.  Cabin crew did their job but nothing more.  Given that Ethiopian is not any cheaper than other airlines, don't think we will use them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JATM21,JATM wrote a review Oct 2019,JATM,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",47 contributions,53 helpful votes,Arusha - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r715563024-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Okay experience but they can do better,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I flew Ethiopian Air round trip from Cairo to Kilimanjaro airport in Tanzania and it was a great flight. Now we also took advantage of an offer to upgrade to business class after buying economy seats. You submitted what you'd be willing to pay for the upgrade and then they let you know a couple of days before your flight if your bid was accepted. We were bumped up for all four legs of our flight at an average of $225.
That said, the planes were beautiful, the people terrific, friendly, food was very good.
All flights were as smooth as could be.
I had never flown to Africa and had never used EA, and I admit I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a very pleasant memory and flights that I wish were longer.

"My husband and I flew Ethiopian airlines to and from Tanzania (Zanzibar and Kilimanjaro), and had one of the worst overall airline experiences I've ever had. While the on-board staff was friendly and the food actually quite tasty, everything else was a disaster. The airline is disorganized, with a convoluted boarding process and no assurance that you'll end up in the seats you selected (my husband and I were separated despite having pre-selected seats). Their website is a disaster-- it offers limitted functionality, and even that often doesn't work. The interior of the planes was ratty and many seats falling apart. The biggest problem, though, was that when we arrived in Zanzibar our luggage did not, and the process of trying to get any information from Ethiopian airlines was a nightmare-- many of the phone numbers listed on their website were incorrect or no one picked up, emails sent to the airline were returned with bounceback messages. When we finally did get someone on the phone, they wouldn't give us any real information, and kept telling us to check back the next day. In the end we were without 2 of our 3 bags for 5 days, and one bag for a full week, causing us to have to rent gear to climb mount Kilimanjaro instead of having the gear we had carefully packed. We received no compensation or accommodation from the airline for this delay in baggage delivery, and even if we had, it would have been only $75/person, which is far less than the amount we had to spend to remedy the situation. I will never use this airline again and I think it should be kicked out of the star alliance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seeitbeforeitsgone,Seeitbeforeitsgone wrote a review Sep 2019,Seeitbeforeitsgone,,4 contributions,6 helpful votes,Chicago - Zanzibar Island,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r713932557-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst airline experience of my life,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Why am i writting this review:

I have travelled with this airline for like 5 years now and i have experienced only 1 flight delay, of an hour.
Its not your typical luxury airline but its decent enough. They keep time, the hostesses are very warm, calm and friendly. Always smilling, always ready to listen.
The only thing i never liked is the mess at ADD, but i recently saw they are working on expanding the airport and raising the standards. I however dont get why transit passengers have to re-do the check in before proceeding to the gates.
One thing i particularly liked is the give a sleeping cot to babies under the age of 2 free of charge!!!! This is huge for mums all over.

"On arrival from Harare were business class passengers collected first at the incoming aircraft and bussed to the terminal where an ET staff guided us to the fast track lane - a single lane which proved to be rather busy as a result of the constant flow of passengers from arriving flights.
Once through arrival security did I have just about 60 minutes left for my connecting flight to Entebbe and proceeded straight to my departure gate (C7 - the same as on my outbound journey to Victoria Falls incidentally) The gate area from C1 to C 11A and B was absolutely packed, and while the water dispensers this time were filled, still no option for buying a cup of tea or coffee. I filled my bottle with water and had enough to drink until we got on the aircraft.
From these gates one is being bussed to the departing aircraft.
My seat 12B proved to be wet so I was lucky to be able to shift to 12C which was not occupied.
For the 1.45 hrs flight to Entebbe did Ethiopian again serve a full hot meal which has the airline top competitors in the region which on similar duration flights - or as the case with SAA on the 4 hour flight to Johannesburg from Entebbe - serve snacks or a lunch box.
The flight was quite full so the crew was pushed for time but still managed to do a double refill on my drinks and later on my tea!

As to the entire C gate area, it would be highly advisable to either install vending machines which accept foreign currency or credit cards or else have a snack bar operating there ... and for business class and Gold / Platinum cardholder passengers would a separate Cloud 9 lounge in this part of the airport be most welcome as a short connection will not allow to walk all the way to the lounges and still make the flight!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Sep 2019,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r712072655-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Left a little late but arrived spot on time in Entebbe!,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I traveled on the Harare to Addis Ababa sector in business class. Check in was very courteous and swift.
The flight itself was routing via Lusaka where passengers from Addis disembarked and new passengers boarded. The process was well explained by the crew through the intercom.
Meal service was started after reaching cruising altitude after take off from Lusaka and proved, as previously experienced in business class, comprehensive.
With a 75 percent load in business was the crew busy but showed a keen desire to please and meet guests' requirements.
Drink service came first and the meal service followed shortly afterwards with a choice of starters, a selection of four main courses and then followed by a cheese selection and tea / coffee with pralines and a desert option. Very good flight and the crew did a super job. No turbulences courtesy I suppose of Capt.

"Both going to and from Cape Town the punctuality was excellent. Staff are helpful although at times the voice of the air hostess was too quiet to hear properly. The pilot's announcements in English were often barely discernible as they talk too fast. When calling for service from my seat, several times, there was no response on the Addis - Cape Town leg and I whistled to a hostess in an opposite aisle to get attention.There was enough space for cabin luggage, especially on the Addis-Abuja sector where they have more modern planes with a better in flight information and entertainment system.

"This is best airline if you want to travel in African continent. They have superb connectivity with all the countries in Africa. For travellers from Mumbai to Africa it is best as they have daily 2 flights flying to Addis.
The hub is Addis Ababa, airport is comparitively small but currently under expansion.
The airline is affordable and competative as compared with other major competitors.
The seat arrangement and comfort is nice, leg room is okay. The meal preference advised during booking is mostly served. The food served is really good.

"Arriving from Entebbe I found a new entry point security check at the terminal in Addis, which was not the case before.
After passing security and reaching the terminal level, I wanted to walk towards the terminal side where the coffee shops and lounges are but was stopped by an ET staff who asked to see my boarding pass and wanted to know where I was going.
I duly explained that I had a 3 hour transit time and wanted to go to one of the lounges but was then told to turn around and proceed directly to the gate, C7. Arguing did not help as the instructions became 'sharper' so I turned on my heels and entered the lower C gate area.
No water in the dispensers, no coffee shop or snack bar for the 3 hour wait and to add insult to injury, the two vending machines only accepted local currency.
This was a bad experience, having to go for 3 hours without a drink of water leave alone tea or coffee or a snack. ET MUST address this anomaly and fast because as the terminal filled up, a lot of people complained loudly, but of course to no avail.

The flight to Victoria Falls was ok, the crew friendly but my in flight experience overshadowed by my transit experience. ET served a full meal service and drinks, but in this case was the damage done!

I consider myself a friend of Ethiopian but this experience I do not wish to have ever again and the truth must be told so that the airline can take measures to prevent this from happening to others.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Sep 2019,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Victoria Falls,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r711285463-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,... and then there was that terrible transit in Addis ...,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overall quite impressed with ET. Flight from MAN was on their newest Dreamliner and was excellent - drop down in BRU enroute is actually OK and certainly beats going to Heathrow - you remain on the flight and people started boarding very quickly. Champagne was free flowing in Business Class and the service was as good as I have had on most airlines.
Then comes Bole airport in Addis Ababa - brace yourself is the only advice I can give - it is pretty chaotic and the business class lounge is only marginally better - hence only a 4* review.
We then went from one extreme to the other with what if my research is correct with the oldest 737 in the fleet for Addis to Seychelles. However same great service on the flight.

"Although this is listed as an Ethiopian Airlines flight, it is actually a Malawian Air flight with a code share. The plane is small, Bombardier turboprop, capable of taking off from the damaged runway at the Blantyre airport. I was originally scheduled on a SAA flight that left at a reasonable hour in the afternoon, leaving me a two hour layover in JNB before our next flight. That flight was abruptly canceled, leaving me with several unpleasant options. I could fly to Lilongwe and spend the night there, then fly to JNB the next morning. I could travel by road to Lilongwe, at least four hours. Or, I could take this flight at 7:30 in the morning, leaving us with 9 hours in JNB. We chose this option.

The flight was acceptable. We were told that we had to check our rollaboards as there was not enough room on board. We noted several other passengers who brought bags at least as big as ours, so if you find yourself in this situation, try to take the bag aboard.

The flight was uneventful. Breakfast was provided. It was OK.

When we got to JNB, we went to the international transit center and checked into our flight to Dubai and on to San Francisco. We were planning to go down to the baggage claim and pick up our bags so we could carry them with us on Business class.

""No problem,"" we were told. ""We can pick them up and check them thru to San Francisco for you."" I am sorry to say the we decided to go for this option. Of course, the bags never left JNB. For all I know, they were still in Blantyre. I won't make that mistake again.

"Transfer at ADD : First to disembark from the aircraft and no transit security check , thus did not face any waiting time or queue.

Lounge : Ethiopian Airlines Cloud 9 Lounge

Not crowded / chaotic as our last time here in the AM. It was literally empty when we arrived around 19:30 , with more passengers filling it up as our departure time approached. As mentioned in my previous review , this is a below average lounge , but an oasis when compared to the rest of the airport. Keep your expectations low.

Boarding : Via the dedicated gate / security channel for Cloud 9 passengers. They ferry you to the aircraft in a separate bus as well.

Cabin / Layout : Here comes problem no. 1 - my BROKEN SEAT. This old 767 was one of their 'Star Alliance' livery aircrafts , and expected to be the symbol of all things good & functional. Perhaps not.
While we were still taxiing , I realised that my seat did not recline even an inch. If that was not shocking enough , we saw that NONE of the crew members ( including the supervisor ) had even the most basic knowledge about the seat controls for the Business Class cabin , forget expecting them to manually rectify / recline my broken seat. Any request by the other passengers regarding basic seat controls , light On/off buttons , etc. resulted in a ""fiddling game"" , followed by a standard response - ""This does not work"" ( even if it ultimately did , thanks to the 'skills' of the passengers themselves )
LUCKILY , there were a few vacant seats on this flight in the Business Class cabin , which was surprising considering most seats in Ethiopian's Business Class cabins are filled with pilots / crew.
Thus , despite having assigned my seat a month in advance , I ended up sitting away from my family , with a stranger on this red-eye to DEL. Even the essential controls like the FA call button did not work here , so has to walk down to the galley even for a glass of water.
What baffles me is what would have they done had the entire cabin been FULL ??? Would I have had to travel sitting for the entire duration of the flight , despite having paid so much for a Business Class seat ???

Crew / Service : Not great individually , but managed to work well as a unit together. Meal service was quicker than all our other flights.

Food & Beverage : Much better than what we got on our other flights.

Arrival at DEL : Here comes problem 2 - our BROKEN SUITCASE. Surprisingly , Sao Paulo does not add separate ""Priority"" tags on the luggage , and just prints the word Priority on the usual luggage identification tag. This obviously is not noticed by the ground staff in Delhi or anywhere else in the world. Forget the bags not coming early , they were the LAST to come , after 25 mins of wait.
But that wasn't enough - we noticed that one of our suitcases was severely damaged , with clear indicators of a heavy impact i.e. had been thrown / fell down. Thus , it came with a missing wheel , and an entire side completely squashed.
While the ground staff agreed to get the wheel replaced , they shamefully dismissed the 'squashing' as regular 'wear & tear' , which according them I should just ""accept"" as ""normal"". This was totally uncalled for.
What followed was multiple calls from our end to the airline office , just to arrange a pick-up of the suitcase for the wheel replacement. Each time we were ""interrogated"" with questions that had been answered before ( suitcase's age/cost/etc. ) .Even then , the luggage handling agency wanted me to send ""pictures"" of the damage , as they wanted to bring their tools for the replacement to be done at my residence itself. This wasn't acceptable , and after much reluctance , they agreed to carry the suitcase to their workshop.
End result - a shoddy repair job , with an OLD & USED wheel as a replacement. Not even the slightest effort made to rectify the squashing.

Have sent multiple emails/tweets to the airline , regarding the dismal overall experience , but to no avail. And yeah , I am a Sheba Miles SILVER member as well , still this is how they behave.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/31/88/f1/puhup-verma.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puhup_Verma,Puhup_Verma wrote a review Sep 2019,Puhup_Verma,"New Delhi, India",408 contributions,236 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - New Delhi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r710028998-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Broken seat & Broken luggage,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have used Ethiopian airlines many times, but this time it was horrendous.We had booked our flights in August of 2018, early enough. During the travel day our nightmare began, we were 10 travellers, 9 of us checked in, one person apparently her ticket couldnt be traced. After about 40 mins we were given one boarding pass, to Addis and told the remaining one,we will get in Addis, big mistake. In Addis at the ticketing area we were told to proceed to the gate and wait. All this time what we didnt know was that the flight was horribly overbooked. Come boarding time, the rest of us were cleared to board, the one person was told to wait. I let the rest board and stayed behind. What I witnessed was just bad, the airline staff carefully selected their own nationals who were also waiting and allowed them to board. When I enquired,  I was told the reason we were waiting was because our Visa was being confirmed in Dubai. I was so disappointed because I knew it was a lie and I told them to stop playing dirty games.

"On both our flights from Israel to South Africa and from South Africa to Israel, the staff was either ignorant, stupid, or chose to lie when we asked questions. As we boarded the plane, we asked various flight attendants whether the flight was full. The answers ranged from ""Oh yes, completely full"" to ""Oh no, quite empty"" to ""I don't know"". It turned out that neither the first or second answer was correct, and not knowing 20 minutes before the flight takes off is unacceptable.
On the return flight, the ground staff claimed that no food or drink would be served on the flight. As I ate my dinner on the plane, and enjoyed my drink, I composed this review in my head.

"We have Travelled to Johanes berg enroute to Port Elezabeth and Cape Town.Also we have returned to Mumbai from Cape Town by Ethio pean airlines.Since we have selected for Cheaper Fares as compared to Emirates,we have not much complain about the inflight services and foods.But the plus point is they give larger Air craft with more leg room and spacious as compared to other luxuray air lines.
Negative point is that Bole international Airport at Addis Ababa is below Standard and you have to go via there ,each time you travel by ET.Drinking water,Toilets ,Resaturents (we did not see any restaurent in the departure hall) are all sub standard.
Also their Transfer services from one Air line to other is horrible and Night Marish.While going to JNB we have no security check at Bole after arrival from Mumbai and we reach the departure lounge at Bole for JNB smoothly.
However during return from Cape town our Flight was delayed by half an hour out of total haul time of one and half hour.After arrival at Bole we told the reception staff that we are late for Mumbai,but they forced us to go for Security ,whle they had only one counter with few security staff member, they forced everybody to open shoes,belts,Coats,Mobile,walet etc.They donot have sufficiient trays and we have to throw everything directly on the conveyer Belts.Many had scratch marks on their mobiles,specs and Checking by the Staff was farcical ie no checking at all ,because they did not have staff and realised that we had little tlme left for Departure.What we find the Security Staff are not trained properly to handle International Transit passengers.Since it was a connecting flight by ET we some how reach the Boarding gate before take off .In fact we were the last few passengers to boardin.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity56721,Curiosity56721 wrote a review Sep 2019,Curiosity56721,,11 contributions,9 helpful votes,Mumbai - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r709339930-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,My recent flight to johanesberg from Mumbai and retun  to Mumbai from Cape Town,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Check-in : We arrived at the airport quite early , and it was a relief to see that the counters were about to open almost 4 hours in advance.
We checked-in at the dedicated desk for Business Class passengers , and the process was quick.
Surprisingly , they do not add separate ""Priority"" tags on the luggage , and it is printed on the usual luggage identification tag. This is futile , as baggage handling staff around the world are trained to identify separate Priority tags only.

Security / Immigration : No priority lines here , but no queues anywhere as Terminal 2 isn't so crowded for International flights.

Lounge : GOL Premium Lounge

Ethiopian uses the old T2 at GRU , and thus assigns the GOL Lounge for use. We were too tired to walk down to the Star Alliance or AMEX Lounge in T3.
The lounge was not as good as its domestic counterpart. Mediocre food & no staff present at the bar. The only saving grace were the weirdly shaped orange sofas , comfortable enough to sleep on.

Boarding : Terminal 2 has the worst lighting possible , making the entire boarding drill seem dreary.
Zone-wise boarding yet again , which in my opinion is terrible. Business class passengers come under Zone 2.

Cabin / Layout : The old variant of a 787 Dreamliner. I personally prefer the seats in this one , as they are longer , wider & do not constrict near the footrest. Would have preferred the presence of an ottoman , like in some other airlines.
The seating pattern is the usual 2-2-2.
This was the first Ethiopian flight in which we saw a curtain / divider being drawn between the Business cabin & the galley.

Crew / Service : A relatively new cabin crew member was responsible for our side of the cabin , and was all smiles throughout the flight. Very courteous & quick.

Food & Beverage : Below average.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/31/88/f1/puhup-verma.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puhup_Verma,Puhup_Verma wrote a review Sep 2019,Puhup_Verma,"New Delhi, India",408 contributions,236 helpful votes,Sao Paulo - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r709311191-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Red-eye to Addis Ababa,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled with Ethiopian airlines to Kenya through Sweden and Adis. So when I was in Kenya, they contacted and informed me to change my departure date since the airline was overbooked. I informed them it would not be possible since I had a Doctor's appointment and I was alsp travelling with my niece who was 3 yrs old. We settled the matter only to get an email later that they have changed my departure without my consent.I was shocked and immedietely contacted the airline. It was like a slap on my face, they gave me to options; 1) I leave Nairobi as earlier booked that is on Monday 18:55 but then spend the whole day in Adis meaning I would arrive in Finland on Wednesday at 10:40 or leave Nairobi on Tues at 18:15 and arrive in Finland on Wednesday at 10:40 am. Remember my initial flight was to leave Nairobi on Monday 18:55 and arrive in Finland on Tuesday at 10:40. With those two options, I opted to leave on Tuesday at 18:15 and arrive on Wednesday 1040 considering I had a young child. To my shock I arrived at the airport, trying to check in, they said my names are not visible. It was a stand off,, I showed them the e-mails and after 3 hours they said its the airline mistake that they had not communicated of the changes. I was in dilemma since my flight had already left. They kept me in the airport and did not even agree to cater for my transport to a hotel neither did they agree to pay for my Hotel. So the next option was to travel on Wednesday at 1700 and arrive on Thursday. That is a whole week wasted on my side and was not able to go for my Doc appointment.

"I caught a sale, so I knew what I was signing up for, had I paid full price... I would've been pissed!

It was a 9 hour flight from NYC (JFK) to Abidjan (layover, than continue on to Accra). The seats were... tight to say the least. I'm 5'10, when I sat, the front seat, was pushing ON my knees, and this was without a recline! It feels as if the person in from of you is almost on your lap. I tried to put the table down, and it couldn't even go all the way done, it was useless to me (and also dirty once I opened it). I had an aisle seat, which didn't help when the flight staff would pass by with the cart. Once they passed me, and it hit me, with my arms INSIDE of the seat.
The food was mush trash, that looked like food they serve in prisons. Luckily I always travel with food, so I didn't starve on this flight.

Again, I caught a sale (my flight was $688 roundtrip) so I knew what i signed up for. It got me there safely, that's all I really asked for.

"We flew from Oman to Cape Town on Ethiopian airlines.  We had heard such mixed reviews and were very sceptical.  We also had an extremely short layover and were worried that we would miss our connecting flights.  When we enquired about it we were told that the plane would wait for us and sure enough, it did.  We actually never even entered the terminal building at Addis Ababa but were driven directly to the waiting plane.

"I flew back business class from Addis to Stockholm ET 0714 - Departing At: 11:40pm (Sun, Sep 1)

The flight itself was superb and the service too. Unfortunately, and Im quite sure of this - the fish I had on my menu was not good. The day I arrived home I got very ill and was put on antibiotics by my doctor.

I was quite picky about what I ate, on the land side in Addis I stayed at the Skylight Hotel and ate there too - which I also understand belongs to the airline (please note at the hotel I had steak everyday which was fine).

Also found this on a forum - not sure how valid it is

"I had a one-way ticket with Ethiopian to fly from Cape Town to Rome, Italy, and was traveling on my US passport. According to Schengen rules, we’re allowed 90 days in the EU with a passport of at least 6-month validity. However, ET refused to allow me to board until I purchased an exit ticket. I had planned to stay a few weeks but hadn’t yet purchased the flight to my next destination. The floor manager told me I must buy a ticket on the spot before I could board. And where is this info on their site? Nowhere. What about during booking? Nothing. I tried so many times to purchase fully refundable tickets, but the prices were astronomical - and my credit cards wouldn’t authorize as it was over my transaction limit. Because nothing worked, I missed my flight and then had to pay an additional $292 in change fees and flight differences. It was only AFTER the flight closed that someone at the counter said I could have made a temporary booking on ET’s website. Ridiculous.

Furthermore, I called ET’s call center at least TEN TIMES and four of those, I kept getting cut off at 14 mins 59 seconds. In another call, I was on hold for 30 mins. They took ages to rebook me. I reckon I was on hold waiting for their self-acknowledged “slow systems” to function for about 3 hours. And each time, someone quoted me a different fare. They have zero clue what consistency means.

If you like to gamble, fly with them; they’re just fine as long as nothing happens. After all these years of flying ET, I will never choose them again. I’ll take anything else — Kenyan airlines, SA airways, Emirates.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/4c/23/62/gabriella620.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabriella620,Gabriella620 wrote a review Sep 2019,Gabriella620,"Rome, Italy",197 contributions,121 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Rome,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r707901434-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Terrible customer service - Cape Town & Addis ,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First, I want to point out that this airline did get me from point A to point B. That was successful.
However, if you have any expectations about this airline based on other airline experiences, you will be disappointed.
First of all, they changed my flight from a 2-hour direct flight to a 4-hour flight with a layover. it's good that i had free time such that I could leave an hour earlier and could arrive an hour later. Oh! and I was travelling with my wife and although her flight details were updated, mine weren't -- if it wasn't for her reservation, iwouldn't have known about the change in flights..
The website and the iphone app were not helpful at all in seeing flight status, in seeing what seats were available, in seeing what gate # my flight, etc.
Seats were tight, but not as tight as some airlines.
On the plane, there was no control over the air conditioning -- there are no overhead vents to direct cool air on you.. Instead you sit in your seat and sweat. Sweat for hours because the A/C controls are under control by the pilots.
My armrest was falling apart -- I nearly cut my arm on the jagged metal edges of the armrest. Side panels had popped out.
The light switches on the armrest (overhead light, flight-attendant-request, etc.) are positioned in such a way that you constantly trigger the switches by accident.. if you put your arm on the armrest, you trigger the FA-request light..It wasn't just me being clumsy, it was the people in front of me and the people across the aisle from me, making this mistake as well.
The meals were tasteless. Similar to my initial comment -- the fact that they give you food is good; you simply need to have very very low expectations about the tastiness of what is offered to you. It is a basic service that gets you from point A to point B; however, if you expect any level of comfort, confidence, or convenience, you should look for another airline.
I'm not mentioning the other things that are outside of the company's control such as passengers that haven't bathed in several days, other passengers that are wearing excess cologe, other passengers that have crying newborns for the entire flight, other passengers that",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gizmosdad00,gizmosdad00 wrote a review Sep 2019,gizmosdad00,"Chicago, Illinois",27 contributions,32 helpful votes,Zanzibar Island - Frankfurt,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r707670884-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Gets you from point A to B; lower your expectations for comfort,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were a bit nervous after booking several segments of flights on Ethiopian, and then reading many negative reviews. It turns out that our concerns were not necessary. This is a very decent airline with affordable, efficient service to destinations across Africa. We flew from Toronto-Addis Ababa-Cape Town for our first leg, then Victoria Falls (via Gabarone)-Addis Ababa for our second leg, several domestic flights (Addis-Lalibela-Gonder-Addis) and then Addis Ababa to Toronto over the course of a month. The international flights were all on relatively new planes (a 777 Toronto to Addis; a 787 Addis to Cape Town; 737-800 Vic Falls to Addis) and on Bombardier Q400s domestically. Previous reviews saying that the planes were old and tired seemed untrue to me; I think the colour scheme of gold and a sort of moss green (derived from the colours of Ethiopia) makes the planes look dated when they're actually not old. The flight attendants were all very polite and especially on the leg from Addis Ababa to Cape Town when a few passengers were particularly rude/unkind to them, and they still held their composure and smiled. The planes felt safe, and the only thing that struck me as odd is that a teenager decided to take a nap in the crossover area between the aisles, causing passengers to have to step over him or wait to cross through the galley,  and the FAs let him stay there until I told one of them that I didn't think it was particularly safe (at which point she agreed and asked him to return to his seat). It was somewhat difficult to hear announcements from the cockpit - they weren't loud enough - but otherwise the safety briefings (while dated - ""put away your portable computers and CD players"") were clear and concise. Leg room, for economy class, was fairly decent. The food was actually quite edible compared to most airline meals I have had - we had ordered vegetarian meals and had no problem on any of our flights receiving these. On the domestic flights, we were quite surprised to be served complimentary snacks of muffins or cheese sandwiches. You don't go hungry on Ehtiopian Airlines - I was very surprised at how frequent the meal service was. Connections were also very efficient - we were worried about a very short connection time in Addis between our flights, but we got our luggage in Cape Town, labelled with a bright ""rapid connection"" tag. The only complaints I have have little to do with the airline, and mostly to do with the airport. While they are definitely trying - and actively seeking feedback from travellers - the airport in Addis is chaotic. Arriving 3 hours before your international flight is not enough - we were fearing we would miss our flight altogether because getting to the check in counter involved a lot of negotiation through chaotic crowds. Customs and immigration, transfers and luggage claim were pretty frustrating (and we were surprised that there was no generator in the domestic terminal when a blackout occurred). Ventilation was poor and there were limited options for buying food or water - none after you passed through the final security check into the departures/gates area. But again, this has little to do with the airline itself - just something you should be aware of if your journey begins or ends from Addis Ababa (and to be honest, I have faced some similar frustrations in Paris and London, minus the blackouts). Let's face it: flying from North America to Southern Africa is a pretty brutal journey, no matter how you look at it, but we were well taken care of on Ethiopian, and have no regrets about our choice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/a6/avatar077.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ug97,ug97 wrote a review Sep 2019,ug97,Canada,72 contributions,115 helpful votes,Toronto - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r707610241-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A decent airline for travel to Africa,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had a round ticket from Douala to Zanzibar with transit at Addis Ababa. I had to sleep in Addis before taking my flight the following day from Addis to Zanzibar.
What's interesting is first the punctuality of all the staff. The plane always came at least an hour and half before departure time. The ground staff gave us (transit passengers in Addis that had to sleep) booking letters for transit hotel in Addis. It was very welcoming.
The plane was very comfortable (Boeing A350) and the food was really tasty.
In Addis everything went easily. We were given transit visa (no fee required) without any complication. A bus shuttle took us to the hotel and in the morning, took us back to the airport.
The hotel itself was not a 5 star but a charming place where you could have a meal and a breakfast. And they were kind to wake us at 6am for breakfast.
We stayed at Sarem, and at Destiny Hotel.
It was really appreciable to be taken cared of by Ethiopian airlines during that short time in Ethiopia.
I could have had a free city tour if my transit time was during the day. My advice to you is to book your flight in order to have some time during the day to visit Addis with Ethiopian airlines.
Advice no.2 is to check the weather. It was cold there (11-13°C), we were in August so if coming from a warm country take warm clothes with you.

"On this flight we had the ""luck"" of flying an old 737-800. The plane shows the signs of heavy use - the seats were worn out and some of them looked fairly bad with signs of repairs clearly visible. A lot of them could not recline and there was no entertainment on board, so the 8 hour flight became quickly boring if you did not bring a book.

Besides that, the seat really lacked the comfort of newer aircraft and after 8 hours in them, my backside spent the next couple hours complaining loudly.

The cabin crew was very profesional and accomodating, as per all the Ethiopian flights.

"Purchased an economy class ticket on the Ethiopian website for around USD 70 per person for a one way from Addis Ababa to Lalibela.  Prior to landing in Addis, we had a delay on our international flight so we had to push our travel by 1 day.

I paid a change fee of USD 10 per person to make the change which I thought was extremely easy and reasonable.

"They are fine once you're on the plane, however, their customer service (should you ever be unfortunate enough to find yourself in one of their offices) is catastrophically awful.

This is not the first time I've been one of these unfortunate individuals. Due to their glitchy, error prone website I've ended up visiting a number of their booking offices to purchase tickets which should have easily been purchased online. Each visit has been a seemingly endless tale of woe.

Their worst office, plumbing almost spectacular lows, must be the airport office in Entebbe. Staff clatter about texting on their phones paying no heed to the waiting customers, the manager once spent 5 minutes babbling in front of us whilst only half dressed, and even when you get someone to try to purchase the ticket for you they are rude, slow, and generally incompetent. There's then the extra charges they add for booking at the office (despite it being their fault due to the relentless failure of the website), which add insult to injury.

To cap it all, as you sit in wonder, marvelling at the gross incompetence, you get to enjoy the luxury of their torn, manky chairs, which we are quite sure we spotted bedbugs on.

To conclude; once you have a ticket they function just fine, almost like a normal airline, but if you need anything from their ""customer service"" be prepared for a long, frustrating, waste of time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamL4512,William L wrote a review Sep 2019,William L,,9 contributions,14 helpful votes,Entebbe - Djibouti,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r706366935-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Spectacularly bad customer service,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Due to this inconvenience, and based Yonah's advice, we had planned to let my elderly grandparents (who have had multiple health issues in the past) take first class. During the flight, despite our explanation to the flight attendant, it was extremely difficult to give my grandparents their medicine or let the grandchildren see them. When asked, the flight attendant could give no explanation for why he wouldn't allow us to go into first class - even with the request to give medicine to the grandparents.

After that, when trying to upgrade from ABB to IAD, there were multiple difficulties in processing the payments and upgrading seats. First, when we tried to make payment for the upgrades, the airline claimed that the payment had been rejected. However, when checking with the credit card company, there was no recorded attempt for any payment. Not only that, but the process to get upgraded was horrific. After various unsuccessful attempts to upgrade online, we called the call center only to find that each representative would pass us off to another department/person who would be unable to help us - this resulted in many hours spent trying to upgrade and check-in while the representatives were underqualified and unable to assist us. In the end, we were told that the first-class flight was completely full - however, on the plane, there were 5 seats open that could have otherwise been filled.

While on the flights, despite booking a month in advance, there was only one food option for the asian-vegetarian menu. This caused the family to eat the same food 5 times on one flight leg - to the point that many members of the family were feeling sick.

Overall, the quality of airline and customer service was beyond negligible. The level of underqualified personnel is deplorable and frustrating - such that we do not plan on taking the airline again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikkam16945,vikkam16945 wrote a review Sep 2019,vikkam16945,"San Pedro, Belize",2 contributions,5 helpful votes,Los Angeles - Arusha,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r706180334-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Poor customer service,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew Ethiopian business class internationally, and then within Ethiopia five flights in tourist cabin.   I found the international flight to be wonderful.  Flawless friendly service beginning to end.   The seat was very comfortable, and the food was almost constant.  I swear, they tried to feed me every half hour with something!   Fortunately, I could pick and choose, and there were many options: western, Ethiopian, fusions.   --   The internal flights in tourist class were OK, not great, but efficient.   The seats were a little narrow, but all of the flights were fairly short.   They offered snacks.   --     The smaller airports are fine, but I found the international airport at Addis Ababa rather confusing, especially on arrival.  Few signs, and although English is spoken throughout the country quite well, the airport personnel weren't very helpful in that language.   Maybe it was just me: the airport (as the rest of the capital) is at 8000-10,000 feet, and that is somewhat disorienting at first.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNEHProfessor,Bill Fulco wrote a review Sep 2019,Bill Fulco,"Santa Monica, California",13 contributions,15 helpful votes,Washington DC - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r706151626-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Great service on Ethiopian,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I don’t even know where to start with this airline. From London all the way to Mombasa, the airline left late for all the flights, the food provided on the plane was not nice at all, the crew members seemed like they didn’t want to attend to any passengers apart from Ethiopians. In Ethiopia, the staff are extremely rude, they are so unorganised, they didn’t even provide wheelchair service until I asked.
On the way back to England, the flight left late once again on all flights, we got to Ethiopia, I had a 12 hour transit and they didn’t even provide us with a hotel, only to those with 8/9 hors transit, the staff are very rude and not attentive, we got a hotel after fighting for 4 hours, the food was very bad at the hotels and they kept telling us they didn’t have any rooms available for us.
We went back to the airport for boarding my flight to London, once again late and got told I had to go open my hold luggage as soon as I’m boarding the flight and they also told me that I would miss my flight when I do this procedure. They are so unorganised and I ended up missing the flight, they told me that the next flight is the next day, they gave me a hotel after 7 hours and everybody else got 4 star hotel whereas I got a 2 star, the hotel bus didn’t pick me up and everybody left, next day went back to get the flight to London again, they flight was delayed and when I got to England, I found out that my luggage’s never even got put on the flight with me.

"Efficient check-in, excellent lounge at Arlanda Airport, Food offered onboard, both international and local Ethiopean food. All tasty, but come hungry as the local food is very tasty (and a bit heavy). Service tentative. No complaints about the airline and the service. BUT the transfer at Addis Ababa Airport was a big mess. Upon arrival from Stockholm we were (together with all arriving passengers from all flights) hurdled in a big group to pass the security control. Luckily we had two hours transfer time, but still no time to visit the lounge at the airport. No one (officials/security guards) could answer or give any information why this security control was done in this way. We have never experienced that before transiting  at this airport.

We had gone to the airport on (Sunday) 25/08/19.
There was a message received from bidair/ pds to say that the luggage was supposed to arrive on that flight (CPTKQ11671).

We were then told that the luggage is still untraceable and cannot be found.

"Entrance Security / Check-in / Immigration : There is a dedicated entry at ADD for Business Class ( Cloud 9 ) passengers , which includes its own private security channel. This leads directly towards the check-in desks , but we already had our boarding passes. This is followed by the immigration , which had its own dedicated queue for Business Class passengers.

Lounge : Ethiopian Airlines Cloud 9 Lounge

Horrible is the word. JAMPACKED. Hardly any seats left when we arrived. Rude agents at the desk just make things worse. The F&B options are avoidable. Washrooms are cramped up. The Wifi works & is the only saving grace. Boarding for flights is announced by the staff.

Boarding : Via the dedicated security gate for Cloud 9 passengers. This leads ro gate no. 22 , from where you are directly taken by elevators to your bus.

Cabin / Layout : Lie-flat seats arranged in a 2-2-2 format. These were the newer seats for the Ethiopian Dreamliner. The seats are comfortable & the seat controls were smooth. The only flaw perhaps was the constriction near the footrest. All the Business class seats were ahead of the galley. Once again , no curtain / divider drawn between the Economy & Business cabin throughout the flight , and the washroom behind is accesible to all passengers , leaving only 1 exclusively for Business class.

Service : Not over-friendly or over-courteous. In short , they did their job well , and as expected. Meal services till GRU were painfully slow though.

Food & Beverage : Much better than expected , but service was painfully slow. There were 2 meals till GRU - Lunch & Hot meal , & another hot meal from GRU to EZE. Do try the Ethiopian options.

"Check-in : At the dedicated Business Class counter. Happy to see the presence of multiple agents who were alert , attentive & helpful. The entire process took the usual time expected for 4 passengers. Since we were eligible for STPC at ADD , our names were already on their list & we were told that we would be handed the vouchers at the boarding gate. In short , everything was streamlined.

Immigration / Security : Via the dedicated queues for First/Business class passengers. The security check took a pretty long time as the crew of a certain airline was using this line rather than the one assigned for them.

Lounge : Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge
Much better in terms of comfort , but nothing great when it comes to F&B

Boarding : An agent immediately recognized us when we approached the gate , and handed us our STPC vouchers. While there were multiple errors in them ( name , gender , etc. ) , but the agent corrected them with a pen , promising that it would not cause any problem ( and indeed there was none ).
Boarding for Business class passengers was through a separate queue but a common aerobridge.

Cabin / Layout : This was a 767 aircraft with seats in 2-2-2 fashion. Honestly , the seats are not as comfortable as desired for a flight of this duration. They do turn into lie-flat beds , but feel a bit inclined near the bulky headrest. Plenty of seats in a not-so-occupied cabin. As per some unwritten rule , Ethiopian crew do not draw any curtain / divider during their flights between the Business & Economy cabins.

Service : They did their job fine , without being over courteous or friendly. Nothing much to write about. The meal service was painfully slow though.

Arrival : Our aircraft kept waiting at an aerobridge gate for someone to operate , but had to rely on buses to transport the passengers. There was no separate bus for Business class passengers. We headed to the STPC/Transfer desk and stood in the separate queue marked for Business class passengers , which was not taken well by the Economy passengers already waiting for their turn at the one-person manned desk ( who honestly was busy chatting with passengers rather than clearing up the queue faster ). Luckily for us , we were told that our vouchers were good enough and we were handed 4 yellow ""visa free/paid for"" coupons.
Immigration was quick , and we met an airline agent handling STPCs right at the gate after the baggage belts. She told us to wait for 5 minutes , after which we went to the parking where a friendly staff member of Skylight Hotel was waiting for us.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/31/88/f1/puhup-verma.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puhup_Verma,Puhup_Verma wrote a review Aug 2019,Puhup_Verma,"New Delhi, India",408 contributions,236 helpful votes,New Delhi - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r702947719-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Morning flight from Delhi to ADD,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is a Malawian Airlines flight in an Ethiopian Airlines plane, sort of code share.

Check in and boarding was fine, but the plane. Wow.

The plane used is a Dash Q400. Don’t know how old it is, but the plane smelled really bad of body odor and bodily fluids. The seats are filthy. The overall interior filthy and you can see squashed bug carcasses stuck to the windows, walls and ceilings. I even had a cockroach run up the seat in front of me.

The food served (breakfast) was totally inedible. Whose bright idea it is to serve fried egg as a meal, should be sacked. The egg was covered in some kind of white ”sauce”, the potatoes were black. The sausage was okay though as was the bread roll even though it was a little bit stale.

Flight staff were friendly and did the best they could.

Having flown Ethiopian internationally a few times, this is not their usual effort, even if it is being flown as a Malawian Airlines flight, it still carries all Ethiopian markings, including flight number.

You really should take this plane out of service and fumigate and deep clean it. It’s that disgusting.

"My son and I flew from LAX to Dublin, Ireland on an ET Boeing 787, and it was nice. We had trouble getting accommodation on other airlines to Ireland, and Ethiopian had a very convenient nonstop from LA. The flight left at a late hour, 1145pm, and arrived after 4pm in Europe, but it continues to Africa. We sat in middle seats in Economy Class, and the seats were average. The service was okay and the food options were good.

"I work in a city where Ethiopian Airlines is the only airline that comes to town and which then takes us to Addis. Therefore, I have been using their services (reluctantly) since 2016. The service is horrible from all standpoints (scheduling/timekeeping, customer service, poor web site, poor application, poor in-flight services (food and on-board personnel) , poor loyalty/miles services (in nearly 4 years I’ve not been able to use any of the Shebamiles so painfully collected!, etc.).

In this many years, I have not had a single restful experience with Ethiopian Airlines. Delayed flights, poor connection times, damaged luggage, stolen items (from luggage), poor hotels provided for connecting flights and the list goes on and on, are a common occurrence.

What hurts the most is the silence from all departments regarding complaints filed over these years. I have flown other airlines in this same time and I can honestly say, Ethiopian Airlines is at the bottom of the pile in every aspect. The lack of customer service and feedback pre and post flight is unforgivable.

If I had another choice when flying out of this city, I’d never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again.

My most recent complaint regarding damaged and delayed luggage has been left unanswered since January 2019.

Perhaps they are sorting through millions and millions of complaints and will get to mine, eventually.

If you have a choice, choose any other airline and save yourself the stress of dealing with this most unprofessional airline.

Note: TripAdvisor app has left the 0 out of the choices but if were there I’d give Ethiopian Arlines a zero!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koritsaki,Koritsaki wrote a review Aug 2019,Koritsaki,Montreal,39 contributions,31 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r701364694-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst Service In All Categories ,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I traveled via Ethiopian airlines from Mumbai to Toronto.
When I checked all my items in my Checkin baggage after coming home, I found that one of my item is damaged and it's unusable. It was due to bad handling of my baggage by the Airlines staff.
When I called the Airlines to check with them, they told that as per their baggage policy, I should have reported this before leaving the airport. This according to me is absolutely ridiculous. How can a person who has been traveling for more than 24hrs open his/her baggage in the airport, check each item and report damages if any?

"This airline is enjoying popular reviews. Perhaps first time travelers. In our recent four flight experience we found the airline safe for which we are thankful. The staff are mediocre although some are truly trying hard to please. The food is well below acceptable. For the interested we will provide info below which may help make decisions. In some parts it is not a nice read ...

As alluded above we recently concluded four long flights on Ethiopian Airlines. This is a truly ""African Airlime"". One needs to have lived in Africa to fully understand the significance of that concept.

Ethiopian Airlines is obviously to us trying to pitch itself against other global carriers. As one of our network said this weekend in word-of-mouth discussion ""to become Africa's hub"". But they are falling far short. Their country (Addis Ababa airport) and Chinese backers are severely letting the airline down.

On the credit side, several aspects about Ethiopian are positive: Seating GOOD LEGROOM. Safety: SO FAR SO GOOD. Not a Malaysian Airlines scenario.

The food was quite UN-appealing on our flights, closely resembled military style food in remote locations. Not at all worth giving any praise to. The one Ethiopian beer we had was great. Thank you.

The staff were African. While this is the Airlines call as to whom they recruit - if they are pitching against the likes of the big and successful players - such as Emirates and Turkish - then they need to up their game. PUT national pride in their posckets and recruit internationally and ectically. They can't have everything ""both ways"".

In terms of cleanliness - something of a horror story on the way from Bangkok to Addis: There was mainly an African clientele onboard who seemed to disembark at Addis. We watched them go to collect luggage. The behaviors onboard was not a problem except for LITTER. The passengers simply threw everything and anything into the aisles. They looked like a disaster area and we had to pick our way through detritus and litter as we went on our occasional walkabouts. "" Welcome to Africa and litter"". A complete human disgrace.

On disembarking in Addis and picking our way around litter in economy class we noticed that Business Class isles were impeccable. Reason ?????

We are not business consultants. However, we are reliable TripAdvisor Advisors. Our tuppence worth... Ethiopian Airlines, sort out the airport at Addis (a complete disgrace), either get you own people to stop littering - or get someone to clean up the isles during flights - and leave them reasonably hygienic such as it was in the Business Class section.

We will not enclose pics. They are too upsetting and won't add value. We have made our points ... Recommendation to friends and family -- use another airline. We have instructed our agents to delete Ethiopian from our repertoire of airlines. It is not worth the one or two hundred dollars saved to put up with the horrible conditions and service (what service) at Addis airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/65/avatar043.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saswcpr,Gerard N wrote a review Aug 2019,Gerard N,"Saint Julian's, Malta",1618 contributions,239 helpful votes,Bangkok - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r700520472-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Try another plane.

"After hearing great things about Ethiopian Airlines, I was rather disappointed in their planes. The first leg of the flight was okay on a 777 which was beginning to show its age. Some of the entertainment equipment was not functioning and some of the upolstery Was frayed, but the seats were comfortable and leg room sufficient. The service was good was good, food barely palatable and had no real relationship with Ethiopian food.
The layover in Bole Airport in Addis Ababa was awful. Crowded with not enough seats,is being generous. Better toilet facilities can be found in the outhouses of the back reaches of the Canadian Rockies. Food facilities overpriced, lacking the ability to take credit cards at cashier's stands, and food below par. Above all, there seemed to be a total lack of organization.
The four flight to Tel Aviv was on a 737 with no entertainment, and a snack I would rather not have eaten. The flight crew was helpful, attentive, and tried their best to improve the situation. For me it would have been a chin on knees situation, had not the passenger in the seat in front of me leaned back to sleep in my lap. I was underwhelmed, but it was by far the cheapest way to go.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/1a/2c/40/aryehby.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aryehby,Aryeh B wrote a review Aug 2019,Aryeh B,"Neve Ilan, Israel",42 contributions,25 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Tel Aviv,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r699718460-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Flight is fine, Bole is one of the worst airports I have experienced.",Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Had great expectations for my first long haul journey with Africa’s largest airline. And it was going to be my 1005th & 1006th flights, and I have flown over 140 airlines worldwide . So I am no rookie. Was excited at first to fly the new, impressive Airbus 350-900 and then the Boeing 787-8 (with the misgivinging name of Dreamliner..). In both planes the entertainment screens did not work neither for me nor my fellow passengers. We told the crew, but no reaction or assistance. Only an overbearing shrug with the shoulders. We are taking about 15 hours in the air...

The food was nothing special at all, and not much. Air Namibia does better in a two hour flight... On the flight from Addis we took off at 23.40 and it took 2 - two hours - before we got served! What was the crew up to, I wonder. Didn’t leave much time for sleeping before preparations begore touch down in Stockholm on the way to Oslo.

I think it is natural to compare EA to Turkish Airlines and South African Airlines, and then they rate far behind. I won’t even bring up Quatar, Emirates and Singapore, they are in another league. And the Airport in Addis (after 4 transit visits to Oliver Tambo in Johannesburg in 3 weeks) is truly a nightmare of a noisy, overloaded anthill of an international hub. Absolutely impossible to understand a single word of the announcements! Who doesn’t anybody tell them that??

Unfortunately, others rather frequent fliers on EA I talked to confirmed my impression. Normally, I am easy to please, and don’t write critical and negative reviews, but this time I was so dissapointed...

If you are expecting standard service on long haul flights then you need to keep very low expectations when flying with this airline. Its not that their service is purposefully sub par but just that this is a young airline and they have expanded too fast and are still learning the nuances of the service industry. Some of the major sore thumbs were during take off the level of cross checking was quite low. There were items left strewn about in the passageway and some passengers had their seats reclined. The seat space isn't that great and on long hauls it does matter quite a bit. The entertainment was decent enough. Food was served at regular intervals and was of passable quality. There are no hard drinks on the menu. Only beer and wine. The check in counter is quite strict about what you can take up as carry on without reason.

"DO NOT FLY ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES when you consider traveling to/ from Lalibela during the rainy season, and certainly not when you have an (nternational) connecting flight (as happened to us). In more than half of the cases your flight will be canceled due to the weather, and you will be stuck at the airport without any information of help whatsoever (no transport, no hotel). In fact, the only info you get is: come back tomorrow. And as EA does not refund if a cancelation is due to weather, you will not only lose your money but still have to arrange an expensive transport by road.
Considering that more than half of the flights were canceled during the fortnight before our flights, it is a shame that they still offer these flights in the wet season. It seems to be an easy way of earning money at the expense of naïve tourists, and a disgrace for an airline which boasts to be a proud member of the Star Alliance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852luca,Luc A wrote a review Aug 2019,Luc A,,4 contributions,4 helpful votes,Lalibela - Addis Ababa,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r698831505-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A disgrace for a member of Star Alliance,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian Airlines has been gradually improving its flight services, central hub, and fleet during the last 10+ years. Although people have grumbled (and rightfully so) about the airport in Addis, it has undergone a recent modernization and has more options to help ease long layovers. The fleet is relatively old but pilots good and flight attendants friendly and helpful, especially in business class. The airline provides passengers with an option to upgrade for a price (that you select above a minimum threshold). Business class was very good but not yet on a par with several other international airlines. The inflight entertainment had a more limited array of options than most major international carriers but the Africa focus (especially for movies) was fun.

"The airline might be okay, but if there is any real trouble, you will be on your own.I have had pretty good experiences with airlines from the travelers point of view.

BUT due to a system failure of Ethiopian airlines I accidentally booked two tickets online instead of one, and made the experience that the customer service is very poor.

First, I was asked to pay a high fee for a ticket I didn't mean to book.

Second, they make empty promises. Basically, they tell you what you want to hear and then unfortunately don""t deal with the problem. I have had one attendant not email me after he said he would (so I couldnt contact him on the issue again) and a second who simply doesn""t respond to my inquiries if the issue is being dealt with.

They say the problem is with managment, but I think they are trying to buy time to have me pay the fee in the end, to at least get some of my money back.

The service is really slow and I fear if there was an even worse problem, they wouldn""t be of much help.

I recommend choosing a more reliable airline, who know what customer service should look like.

I have paid double the amount for a single flight now and I don""t see a chance of getting the money back!

I also recommend, if you do choose to book with this airline to make sure only that which you actually ordered is being taken out of your account.

I might change my mind, if the problem is being dealt with eventually.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoardingPass329458,BoardingPass329458 wrote a review Aug 2019,BoardingPass329458,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Frankfurt - Djibouti,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r696111938-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,When their system fails....,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The seats are not quite lie flat but they were very easy to sleep in (note: very tall people may not be able to stretch right out but these seats are good). The entertainment system had a wide variety of choices in several languages. Meal service was excellent with above average food quality and drink selection. Great coffee.

"Everything about the airline is average, but my comparison is with Asian airlines and Ethiopian is just not in the same class. The food is poor and the staff, whilst firendly have a poor work ethic. Of course they will help, but only if you ask and you will probably need to ask several times. The cabin was mostly empty but clearly the staff were spending more time chatting to each other than serving customers. The plane would have benefitted from a good clean. Lagos airport is a disaster although the check in process was fine. The lounge is horrible and the terminal worse. Addis was OK as an airport, but nothing to write home about.

As compensation they provide a hotel voucher for the extended stay in ADD, but airport is hopelessly inadequate for the number of passengers traveling through it.

"Flew five different flights with Ethiopian on a recent trip. Most were delayed, including one for more than 2 hours. No compensation since it was a long-haul flight from Europe. Departure time for one domestic flight was changed twice in one day, leaving hours earlier than the ticket I had booked, but then delayed until the departure time of the flight I had originally booked.     	The worst thing happened as I was sitting by the gate in terminal 1 at Addis. At the boarding time printed on my boarding card they started boarding people for my flight. There was no sign or screen telling which flight it was, and I couldn’t understand the announcement on the loudspeaker since the sound was so distorted. I queued up, gave them my boarding pass and followed the others to the plane. The flight attendant inside the plane looked at my boarding card and explained I was on the wrong plane. This was a plane headed for Djibouti (instead of Gonder, my destination)! She sent me back inside to wait for my correct flight. How could they make a security error like that?

Transit was swift at Addis Ababa, airport was clean and tidy, not spectacular, shopping expensive, and seating was limited, however one could fona a seat as reviews rightly mentioned. Next flight was on time as well and the aircraft better the previous one. Over all a pleasant satisfied flight all the way.
If you are booked by Ethiopian airline, do more panic, you may lucky as I was, saying so, be prepared for a worst experience as well as 90% of reviews can't be wrong totally.

"We flew in from Dublin to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. The planes were fine, and the cabin crew friendly. All our flight were late though. Arriving in Madrid, we were supposed to sit in the plane for one hour, before take off again. We sat for two hours, in the stuffy plane, before taking off again. We were almost late for our connection to Cape Town in Addis Ababa, and we were rushed to the connecting flight by bus, ( not via the terminal building ).

"We flew this airline on multiple legs from US to Rwanda to Seychelles.  Less than a week before we were to fly back from Seychelles to US, they notified us our flight had been cancelled.  This was a major inconvenience.  The customer service was terrible trying to fix the problem.  The only options they wanted to give us was to leave our wonderful resort in the Seychelles a day early or day late, spend a night in Addis Abbaba, or receive very, very small refund.  The refund offer was not nearly acceptable to cover THEIR mistake.  They cancelled the flight last minute, and were not willing to make an equivalent change.  My wife spent countless hours dealing with them, and they were not helpful in the least.  I feel like other airlines would have acknowledged their mistake and provided an appropriate refund or booked us on a flight home the day our original flight was scheduled with another airline.  This airline was not willing to help, and I highly recommend to never fly with this airline.

"The worst airline I've ever flown on my life of over 65 years. They canceled my flight & provided awful alternative flights. None of which were remotely acceptable. They lied about flight availability. They said that a flight I booked while on the phone with them wasn't available. I told then that I just booked it. They said that it was impossible because it wasn't on their system. They only have access to certain other airline flights when more flights are really available.
We asked for a refund which they calculated at one third of the cost of the least expensive alternative.
Their flight cancellation cost me more than $1,000. They took little responsibility for their breach of contract & looked for ways to not be helpful in order to save money.
They didn't care about the customer. They only cared about the least expensive solution no matter how much the customer was inconvenienced.

I dont recommend to anyone to fly by Ethiopian airlines. I came from frankfurt to addis ababa and proceed to Mekell for north tour. It was very tired moment. It has  a lot of times delayed while i flew the local flights. The international one is better than the local airplanes. The local airplanes are like an old big bus in the country side. It has a lot of sounds and difficult to feel safe when it flying and landing. It has discounts but worth to fly by another flights.

"The worst flight I’ve ever experienced. We paid top dollar for first class or what they call business class.  It was the dirtiest plane I’ve ever been on.  The bathrooms were dirty, like disgusting.  The seat I sat in had dirt, grime, and crumbs in every crevice.  The walls and vents had spill stains.  The carpet was stained and littered with crumbs. They had to get someone to semi-vacuum the area, but it was still disgusting. The seats lied all the way down, however very uncomfortable.  I had to just breathe and meditate through an 18 hour flight with them. We stopped in Dublin to refuel to make it to Washington.  It was very hard for me to tolerate the filth, but what choice do you have when you’re trying to make it to the states.  All I could think was I can’t wait to shower and get clean clothes on.  I’m now in Washington awaiting my flight to Dallas. I can’t wait to be home.  My whole thing is my husband and I paid 14,000 round trip and the plane should be clean at the very least and comfortable.

"This is my third year flying with Ethiopian Airlines. Dublin - Addis, Addis - Dar es Salaam.
I have returned to Ethiopian Airlines year on year because of the luggage allowance and decent service and prices.
The airport in Addis is terrible but I'm used to it and I found the airplanes and staff to be pleasant and adequate.
Until Monday 8th July. The flight was late leaving Dublin and was to stop in Madrid for one hour. Yet the plane continued past Madrid and landed in Barcelona with no information, no warning and no reassurances. Eventually the captain told us via intercom that we would be flying back to Madrid but there was no extra information, no information on our connecting flights to the reason for this detour. Nothing.
We waited 4 hours on the Barcelona runway. We were offered one glass of juice or water.
Finally we flew to Madrid and were a further 3 hours on the runway. No refreshments were offered.
When we finally took off it was 4am and they came around with dinner!! The dinner that had been sitting on the plane for the past 7 hours. Why couldn't there be a change of food while we were waiting in Madrid.
During these runway waits the staff sat in their seats chatting to each other. There were no updates, no information and no reassurances. It was bizarre. We couldn't sleep because we hadn't a clue what was happening. Were we going on a different plane? Was there a problem in Madrid? Were we in danger?
I finally arrived in addis to a text message telling me what flight to take. There was no announcement on arrival to direct us to the correct gates, especially those of us who had a very short time to catch the flight.
It was really terrible, scary and totally bizarre. I've made contact with the airline and keep receiving automated messages. After my 18 hour marathon flight I dread the return journey.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTreacyTravels,MsTreacyTravels wrote a review Jul 2019,MsTreacyTravels,"County Galway, Ireland",34 contributions,21 helpful votes,Dublin - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r690887243-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst flight I ever had ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am a frequent visitor to Africa.  Connecting to the countries that I visit is easiest on Ethiopian.  Absolutely, the airline is the safest and best managed.  Cabin crews are excellent, well trained and polite.  But, connecting at Addis Ababa is still onerous.  If connections are short, security queues easily consume one's connection time.  The new terminal seems as if it will never open.  Most flights disembark on the tarmac and one can find oneself waiting for a while in the  rain.  I really hope that the airport management can pick up their game to match the airline.Separately, the airline sweats its assets.  Planes are turned around swiftly,  So cabin wear and tear is obvious.

"After 27 years I returned to African again on ET. A good airline even if they run on African schedules. But am rather sad. We are  team of 5 who chose ET because of the schedule getting us to the city we wanted with only one stop. But they changed that several times including a change at 4am on the morning we flew. This made us miss our connection of now 2 enroute stops. Our bags didn’t make it although we were told they were on the next flight arriving in a few minutes. After 2 hours the plane arrived without bags so we had to leave on a dangerous, in the dark, 2 + hour drive. 2 of our team had to return on the next day (4 hours) to collect the baggage. Increased expense and a delay of 24 hours for some of the team. On the return flights with 2 stops not one, the flight schedule was again changed. That after a layover of 5 hours which became 6. We made our last connection and was not impressed as we taxied a passenger wandered down the aisle and was just watched by a flight attendant. I’m in the middle of. an exit row of a 777 but the passengers next to me are allowed to leave shoes and bags in the aisle. The crew were told several times but did nothing. Delays are acceptable and built into schedules.  The changes we faced were more than that. For their own purposes ET added extra stops taking us out of our ways and extending travel times. Safety is a bigger concern to my mind. ET has diminished a lot in my opinion.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/3b/58/74/jill-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillH858,Jill H wrote a review Jul 2019,Jill H,"London, Canada",169 contributions,43 helpful votes,Blantyre - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r690449474-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Stick to your schedules.

"This is a ""get you there without too much damage"" sort of airline: Nothing really terrible but also not in the top class (e.g. 20-30 airlines) of world carriers.

Three specific things:

1. Addis Ababa is not yet a suitable hub for the number of flights it apparently is a hub for. Evidently they can accommodate many more airplanes than they can people. There are shops, restaurants and bars (all of which were quite full) but minimal seating for people awaiting flights. I and many other travelers literally sat on the floor waiting to be allowed to go through security. Once through security at the gate entrance they told me: ""Not yet; Take a seat"" which I and several others near me had a good laugh at because there were no seats.

2. The food is mediocre, and slightly confused. On the first leg of the flight I ordered beef, which was meatballs with overcooked pasta. So on the second leg I ordered chicken. Which was meatballs with overcooked pasta. I can't confirm the meat type in either meal but it seemed identical.

3. I had a very hard time being given water on the flight. It took me about 30 minutes after the meal to convince someone to let me have a glass of water, and then that was it for the remainder of the 8 hour flight. I slept for and when I awoke my throat was painfully parched and I developed a significant respiratory ailment as a result. (Dry air and a plane full of people often can lead to respiratory issues, but good airlines help prevent this by making sure you have the water you need). There was also a weird thing with an obese Congolese woman with a baby who didn't want me to recline my seat--like she hadn't paid for enough space so she wanted some of mine. I felt like she had the backing of the flight staff (i.e. not just a nutty fellow passenger, but one who was being enabled by the flight staff), though eventually I just did it.

Overall, it was okayish--I got there, and nothing super traumatic happened. If you get a good price on the ticket its probably worth it, but don't expect too much.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njuloti,njuloti wrote a review Jul 2019,njuloti,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan",33 contributions,40 helpful votes,Nairobi - Brussels,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r689141102-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Don't expect too much: Quite mediocre but not awful,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have to thank Jet Airways for collapsing. We’d been used to direct Mumbai-London flights for so many years that there couldn’t have been any reason for us to pick Ethiopian except as a last-minute reasonably-priced switch. We were surprised when it turned out to be a good experience. We flew in a new aircraft, and everything, right from the excellent safety video to the hospitality of a decent hotel with basic meals during our layover, was a treat.
I’m never surprised when I get glazed looks and impersonal treatment from cabin staff – it’s not an easy job they do. So to be talked to with individual eye contact was unexpected, and a pleasant surprise indeed. It looks like Ethiopian does a good job of training. I want to especially thank Ms Rakeb W. On our flight from Mumbai, there was a mix-up with vegetarian meals and she made quite an effort to ensure that we got a really good veg meal though it was delayed. It was a pleasant surprise to see her again 18 days later on our return journey! Thank you, Rakeb.
While I must say that the airline is very good, unfortunately Addis Ababa airport is disorganized and has no priority lounge. Both times we passed through it, we stood for far too long in stupidly long, slow-moving queues. THAT we did not enjoy, and that is the only reason I will probably not book by Ethiopian again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/fc/5b/d0/saaz-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaazAggarwal,Saaz Aggarwal wrote a review Jul 2019,Saaz Aggarwal,,40 contributions,29 helpful votes,Mumbai - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r688563555-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A pleasant surprise,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm usually pleased with this airline, but this time, it was certainly sub-standard. the flight was Lusaka to Addis Ababa and then a change of planes from Addis Ababa to Toronto.The food was horrendous. I had a pasta that was so overcooked that I literally picked up the entire blob at one time with my fork,,,and it had no sauce! Most of the portions were very small, and during one meal, it appeared that someone forgot to finish putting food in the container before they sealed it. My husband had twice the amount I had, and even his wasn't much. For the long flights, we ate mostly rolls and butter.

On both flights, my entertainment screen had issues. I asked for earbuds and was told they didn't have them; so how are customers supposed to enjoy the entertainment on a 13 hour flight???

One flight had many children, mostly elementary school age, and they were all over the plane, except no in their seats. With so much turbulence, it would have been prudent for the flight attendants to be strictly enforcing the seat belt rule.

Shortly before landing, during the descent, a father got up with 2 children and was in the restroom a long time, and then a woman also went. I couldn't believe we were so close to landing and this was not being stopped.

Upon landing, a women got up and opened the overhead bin and got out all her belongings while the plane was driving to the gate. This spurred an onslaught of others who did the same. It appeared that half of our cabin was up and moving before an attendant told everyone to take their seat! I never saw anything like this, and I travel internationally quite a bit.

The only plus was that the economy cabin seats are wider with more leg room than most others.

I also could not get seat assignments in advance, although I booked months before, and I've been home 5 days, and I still don't have my missing luggage.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/af/3e/44/internationalmama.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/internationalmama,internationalmama wrote a review Jul 2019,internationalmama,"Wooster, Ohio",200 contributions,95 helpful votes,Lusaka - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r688285896-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Not Their Usual Standard of Service,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian is a great airline and their business class (they do not have first class) very comfortable - their seats are adjustable in so many ways, including to a flat bed, that you can really make yourself comfortable. Since I was travelling with a recently broken arm, this says something. Staff was really helpful and concerned that I would be at ease. One thing though about Bole Airport. Business class has its own gate, where travellers for a given flight go through their (third) security check and are then bussed to their plane. While this is convenient compared to the enormous crowds for economy, it seems most international flights are leaving in the evening in a very busy schedule. Thus, traffic around the shops, and in the lounges, is heavy. Careful you leave enough time to get to your flight, ie, from entering Bole to when you get on that bus!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobieb,Cobie B wrote a review Jul 2019,Cobie B,"Canberra, Australia",36 contributions,37 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Singapore,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r688267740-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good airline but be early for check-in,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"When people heard I was flying Ethiopian, they would bring up that recent crash - however, I make a distinction between a fault with the aircraft, as was the case here, and a fault that may lie with the airline, such as pilot error or poor maintenance. Ethiopian is fast developing to one of the major, if not the major, African airlines; I was surprised to see how many international flights they offer, and these are still expanding. Their fleet is very new and Bole Airport in AA is being built to be a major international and national hub. Staff was very courteous and helpful. I also flew business class on my way back.

"I took two Ethiopian flights to get to Montreal. The first to legs, Lilongwe to Addis, and Addis to Toronto were both comfortable, even (yes) in Economy. I eyed the very nice business class seating, and one day would love to upgrade but that day has not yet arrived. The in flight service was fine. Not especially fantastic or great, but fine. Some of the attendants seemed to be quite relieved to be rid of us after the second leg, though this is not a concern for me. Decent food, though the granola bars were not super great, fine not stellar. Fantastic in flight entertainment system. My biggest concern may not have to do with Ethiopian airlines at all, but the hollow “star alliance” garbage. Once in Toronto, our Air Canada connection experience could not have been less helpful or more confusing. I am an experienced traveller, and I have not seen such poor service. Of course, we missed our connecting  flight, told to go three different places and then dinged with extra fees. Everyone we encountered at each stage was unhelpful and seemed to be doing the very very basics of getting the customer out of their hair. So thumbs up for Ethiopian, thumbs down for crappy connection in Toronto with so-called Star Alliance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/d8/f7/be/m-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merrianne,Merrianne wrote a review Jul 2019,Merrianne,"Montreal, Canada",181 contributions,103 helpful votes,Lilongwe - Montreal,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r688195908-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good value for long haul,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was the first time I flew Ethiopian. On the flight from Dulles, we had a middle seat between the 2 of us so it was tolerable. The seats are hard and older. A little boy across the aisle was airsick at least 9 times during the flight. At one point was sick in the aisle. When no one came to clean it up, the man sitting next to the mess put his blanket over it to keep people from unknowingly walking through it. After that, 2 attendants came with cleaner and gloves and actually raised their voices at him for trying to help the issue. They offered no assistance to the mother who had several other children with her. My daughter and I gathered up more fresh little bags to help her. The return flight was the same uncomfortable plane. The food was basically the same unappetizing thing served over and over the almost 22 hours we were on the plane. We were delayed 2 hours on the runway to fix a broken windshield wiper and then an hour or so on a stopover to Dublin to refuel. The Addis airport gate area is terrible. You can't bring water through the security to the gate and once you are in the gate there is no place to get water and no restroom facilities. In flight entertainment had some decent movies, but I gave up trying to watch them because every time you have to go through the airlines promo video and if you paused or rewound the movie, it would start all over again with the promo video.

But I could not have a flight to go stokholm from oslo because my visa is single entry type even I would like to depart at stockholm but the airline is ethiopia.

"We booked specifically because of the lie flat seats advertised on each leg of our trip only to discover that the aircraft used on the 7.5 hour trip from Addis Ababa to Moscow & return was a Boeing 737 & not a 787 which means a much smaller, much older plane, seats that did not fully recline & no in flight entertainment in the seats. If we had been aware of this change we most definitely would not have booked business class but rather economy as the flights were not full & we could have had a couple of seats each & lay across them. I have repeatedly emailed the airline with no response from them at all despite their claim of world class customer relations!  The other issue I have is with the ""Business Class"" lounge - the bathrooms are so dirty & smelly it is ridiculous.

﻿"This review relates to group travel. I had over 100 persons traveling in a group. To begin with, they gave me no control of the seating, so related parties with different last names were not seated together. It took 50 hours of work to get them to redo the seating, and it still wasn't correct. My consolidator told me that they raised the price $80 per person, even though they had a contract, which they were forced to absorb. The group was supposed to stay at the airline's new hotel in Addis (Starlight). At the last minute they broke the group and sent them to 8 different hotels, all of which were terrible. Someone was paid off as the Starlight was expecting the group as a whole. Totally ruined the end of the tour for everyone, they lost their farewell dinner, and were subjected to filthy conditions. Everyone complained about the facilities at the airport in Addis and the unfriendly service they encountered.

"We have travelled with Ethiopian air twice in the last three weeks. From Cape Town to Istanbul via Addis Ababa and return the same way.  The airline is very proud of their heritage and rightly so if you see what they have achieved so far. The flights were on time and their prices are excellent but there are a few small things they need to look at to achieve higher scores.  The toilets on the 737 flights out of, and returning to Addis from Istanbul, which are about 5 to 6 hours long, were very dirty and wet from urine on the floors. There is obviously no attention to detail from the stewards regarding the toilets.  We also received very little fluids on the Addis - Istanbul trip.  Dehydration is a very real possibility in a relatively short period of time on long flights if you look at medical data.  But otherwise there were no other complaints except that the Boeing 737 they used on the shorter legs can become very cramped on flights more than 3 to 4 hours long! The longer legs from CT to Addis and back are in a Boeing 777 which is a lot more spacious.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivahnvn,Ivahnvn wrote a review Jul 2019,Ivahnvn,"Melkbosstrand, South Africa",22 contributions,17 helpful votes,Istanbul - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r687131737-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Flight or fight?,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My wife and I flew out from JFK on July 1 en route to Cape Town via Addis Ababa where we spent the 10 hour layover in a complimentary hotel.  That was an accommodation included in our Business Class travel.  Sadly our luggage was not stored properly and apparently left outside overnight in a torrential downpour as it is the rainy season here.  We discovered that upon unpacking our clothes at the hotel to discover all our clothes were SOAKED.  And the hotel had no guest laundry.   So we had to send out our clothes to be dry cleaned.  When our luggage arrived at CPT one piece was missing.  Sadly it was my wife’s which included all of her shoes along with my shoes and all her cosmetics.   We submitted a claim and were assured the bag would be on the next flight to arrive and be delivered to our hotel the next day July 4.   I called the morning of July 4 and was told that the bag would be delivered to the hotel. Sadly it was not.  Now it’s July 5 and my wife is fit to be tied.  I’m not happy about the inconvenience and expense we’ve incurred.  The hotel clerk was not encouraging as she said “...this happens all the time...”This was a trip of a lifetime. This was my retirement trip that I looked forward to for years.  And to have this miserable experience foisted upon us is very regrettable.   If you are flying to South Africa make plans on another airline.   Or only pack carry on.  This airline does not have the capacity or capability to handle important material like luggage.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/1e/3c/3b/michael-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcT7673WN,Michael C wrote a review Jul 2019,Michael C,"Pearland, Texas",837 contributions,174 helpful votes,New York City - Cape Town Central,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r686881066-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Great Planes but terrible luggage handling,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A truly wonderful airline. Safety seemed tops. Service and food excellent. Legroom one of the best we have experienced. BUT we have an airline here whose success has outgrown its own hosts (Addis Ababa airport) infrastructure. Our trans-planing at Addis was a horrible experience - one which we would not suggest that others endure until Addis sorts itself out. What would have been a five star review gets three because of the chaotic situation there. Perhaps try another airline until they sort themselves.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/65/avatar043.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saswcpr,Gerard N wrote a review Jul 2019,Gerard N,"Saint Julian's, Malta",1618 contributions,239 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r686810171-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Wonderful airline, atrocious airport at Addis",Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was supposed to fly out from Dulles airport on June 25, 2019, on a COTE D IVOIRE flight operated by Ethiopian Airlines. Upon my arrival, at the airport, I noticed there was no-one at the counter. I figured I had just arrived too early since my flight was at 9:00 PM and it was only 5:30 PM. After waiting an hour, the ticket counter still was not open so my family and I decided to call the airline's 1-800 number. They told us that someone should have been at the counter. Simultaneously, a young lady sitting across from us then interjected and informed us that her family was going through the same situation. Her father was supposed to fly out on the same flight but they told him the flight had been canceled. She said he was downstairs in the office speaking with a representative. I proceeded downstairs to try and speak with the representative and get information as to what was going on. He reiterated the same information the young lady said and said that there was nothing he could do. At first, he refused to contact anyone and had a nonchalant attitude. As the minutes passed more passengers came and he finally got in contact with a supervisor. The supervisor was also of no help and proceeded to claim that we had been sold fake tickets and that we needed to contact our booking agents. With a crowd of approximately 20 people in their office; women and children included, Ethiopian Airlines refused to even issue out meal tickets to us, though it was already almost midnight. After six hours the airline representatives finally spoke with the booking agents and it was determined that Ethiopian did not agree with the price point COTE D IVOIRE airlines set and because of this, they ended the agreement with them, a month prior to my flight although they continued to advertise it. They refused us any services for our inconvenience, issued no apologies, simply said there was nothing they could do for us. In the end, I had to cancel my trip because there was a limited time I could go before I resumed school. I will never even attempt to fly Ethiopian again. Poor customer service is an understatement for this company.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gc_Yaw,Yaw wrote a review Jul 2019,Yaw,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Washington DC - Abidjan,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r686257529-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Horrifying Experience #NeverAgain,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After a lot of soul searching I have decided to share my experience with Ethiopian airlines based on my experience with them.
If you haven't tried them or gone thru their airport please don't try. The language barrier is a big problem. Unskilled staff. Managers are worse than the staff.staff are Lazy to get solutions. Passengers are humiliated at their Ethiopian office at the ground floor. The staff can leave a passenger in the counter talking and leave the desk to go and eat. They take advantage of desperate passengers to show their power. If you don't have any dollars with you and you have a layover you can't get even a cup of coffee or a bottle of water, since they do not take other currencies and their card machines are never working. The female staff are the worst they speak to passengers like they are buying the tickets for them. NOTHING GOOD ABOUT Their support office.

"Ethiopian really isn't a bad airline to travel with at all, admittedly they aren't as refined as some of their more established competitors but this adds to the charm of the experience somehow! Their aircraft are all fairly new and most are Dreamliners so there is a touch more room than you usually get in cattle class. The food is fairly hit or miss but there is always something on the tray that you'll enjoy. Cabin crew tend to be quite brusque in manor but I find it quite refreshing they aren't all fake smiles & politness.

"In the course of travelling to Malawi about once a year to visit a small charity that I support, I’ve now used Ethiopian Airlines several times. The main reasons for this are that they allow a good luggage allowance - for all the clothing and other things I take out, have a good connection hub in Addis Ababa - that is constantly improving and developing, and their aircraft are modern and pleasant to travel on. On my most recent trip I noticed a great improvement at Addis Ababa with a new departure lounge for African flight connections. The lounge previously was small, crowded and chaotic. The new lounge is much better. It should also be pointed out that toilet facilities are greatly improved.

This new review is based upon 4 flight legs (a return flight with a stop-over in both directions).

The check-in lady weighed the 2 standard-size cabin bags at 8kg each and was happy for us to proceed to the gate. When we arrived at the gate there was a man there wearing a yellow security jacket. He insisted on weighing our 2 standard-size cabin bags, my computer bag and jacket, my wife's handbag and coat, each on top of one another on the scale, and then routed us to an aisle on the left. At the same time he allowed through, without weighing any of their hand luggage, a large group of some 30-40 passengers wearing green tee-shirts representing 'St. Margarets helping Malawi'. Many of these St. Margaret's passengers had rucksacks on their backs as well as a cabin bag, which, if applying consistency, should also have been weighed. When we boarded the plane the cabin bags and rucksacks of the large group filled many of the overhead compartments to capacity. Having joined the queue on the left, the lady who worked for Ethiopian Airways advised us that we were only permitted one piece of hand luggage each to take into the cabin, ie. my computer bag and my wife's handbag, and that the 2 standard-size cabin bags had to go into the hold. We were extremely anxious about the 2 standard-size cabin bags going into the hold as like many travellers, we put our valuables in them so that we have them with us to prevent loss as sometimes a hold bag can go missing. The lady requested payment of 80 GBP for being 10kg overweight or we wouldn't be allowed to board the flight. This was an awful lot of money to us who live in an African country with a weak currency and amounted to 10.8% of the overall fare that we had paid for the flight. Furthermore we couldn't understand how this 10kg had been derived. She advised that payment could only be in cash and not having any cash on me I had to walk 200 metres back to an ATM and then 200 metres back to the gate to pay the money and obtain a receipt. We boarded the flight feeling very aggravated and weren't able to relax or sleep during the overnight flight and consequently we did not enjoy the flight. The question needed to be asked why there had been inconsistency with only certain passengers being selected for weighing, while the large group had been waved through without weighing? My wife and I have always travelled with a standard-size cabin bag each, my computer bag and her handbag and have never had a problem with any other airline. Furthermore, as the 2 standard-size cabin bags were weighed at the original bag-drop check-in and were OK for the permitted weight, there was no reason to weigh them again at the gate check-in. Finally to rub salt in our wounds, the plane stopped in Brussels to take on passengers and many of them had extremely large bags, far more weight than we were carrying, and they had been allowed to board the plane. I've attached pictures of some of these bags in the overhead compartments. I raised our grievance with the stewardess on the plane who was horrified at what we had been charged and having spoken to her supervisor she requested my contact details and kindly forwarded my complaint to Head Office. We asked that we be treated fairly like the majority of the passengers on the plane and that the airline consider making a refund of the 80 GBP. Despite further liaison with the Customer Relations Department by email and giving the airline the opportunity to put the matter right, our pride has been further dented by the airline not taking the time to consider our complaint properly and has refused our request for a refund.  Regrettably it seems, preferring a lose-lose scenario for both of us.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/88/a4/dr-who-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dr_Who_13,Dr_Who_13 wrote a review Jun 2019,Dr_Who_13,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",46 contributions,45 helpful votes,Manchester - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r684897565-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A horrendous experience,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew Ethiopian Airline (my first time) from Cape Town to Israel,  as it was most directly and shortest traveling time - includes transfer with kids. The service at checkin counter was good, it was no problem at all with security etc. On board, the temperature was correct 23-25C, not too cold most of the airlines are freezing, was comfortable, the seat was surprisingly spacious than other airline (includes emirate), Recline was proper recline. The food was very average, but bread was very fresh and tasty. The airport in Addis was not like Dubai, Hong Kong, Paris, but it is still okay compare to other Africa countries, luckily the lay over was not long else it would not be idea. From Addis to Israel the cabin was cooler, but still good 16-18C.

"I would like to share my experince with you. The Flight attendant chews gum constantly with their mouths open. Its gross and extremly unprofessional. Food is disgusting and they only offer beer and wine. No hard alchol. Also the plane was so hot, people were sweating. It was extremely uncomfortable as there is no control of the temperature

Layovers are so short. When you get to addis ababa. No one is willing to help you find your flight. Staff are so rude when asking questions. Then when we arrived in dublin. We waited on the runway for extended periods of time when we should have left. When asked what the problem is they will not tell you. Then they make you check your duty free alcohol so its put in the under carage of the plane. I knew how this was going to end.. well as i figured when i arrived in toronto it was broken. I also waited and waited for my luggage which i could not find. Eventually found it in oversize. Which it was not oversize. It was just a jock bag so not sure why it was in oversize. The combinattion of the plane being kate, my broken duty free and not being able to locate my luggage made me late for my plane to calgary.

Then having to deal with the ticket people to book a new flight was painful. They were extremley rude and just through a paper at me to go to air canada. I went over to air canada and waited in line once i get to the till they tell me eithiopia air did not book me. So i had to go back to eithiopia air and wait again to have them fix it and then go back to air canada and wait in line there again

You think they would be kinder to people who have been travelling for 25 hrs. But no, they do not care.

I can say i will never book with this company again. And not to mention have i not heard from anyone regarding my replacement duty free.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaell372,Rachael L wrote a review Jun 2019,Rachael L,"Calgary, Canada",52 contributions,23 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Calgary,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r684527398-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst airline to date,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

So I flew Ethiopian Airlines from Los Angeles to Ethiopia to the Congo- then back to Ethiopia - Paris. I must say...I travel for a living and although the plane’s interior seems old and grungy...the seats are the most comfortable seats I’ve ever flown internationally!! They recline like a grandfather sitting chair. When the seat goes back the bottom of the seat comes forward making it feel like a reclining bed. It’s amazing!! Make for a very comfortable long flight!

"I have been a regular passenger on this carrier. My latest experience, with the ground staff was just amazing. I was bound for Kuwait and my connecting flight was within 7 hours of my arrival in Addis Ababa. The flight attendants on board explained to me that I am entitled top a hotel stay whilst waiting for my next flight. I got to interact with a member of the ground staff by the name of Hagos Tewelde. Not only was he extremely friendly and helpful but also showed sincere empathy to me being sick. As soon as he was able to attend to my request, he did issued a voucher that allowed me a half day accommodation at the 5 star Skylight hotel.
The only reason I give then a four star rating is because the aircraft ( Boeing 737-800 used on the Johannesburg to Addis Abeba is rather old The business class section of this aircraft is really not great and I hope they will phase them out soon and use more of their

"The worst airline service that exists!! let me explain the episode in detail. I came to Rwanda to visit my parents from New Zealand about a month back and we decided to visit Egypt, which by the way is a magnificent place, totally worth it!!
Keep in mind, Rwanda is an on arrival Visa approved country and I have had no issues in entering or exiting the country.
The day came when we had to go back to Rwanda from Cairo, we are at the airport, waiting to drop off our baggage as we had already checked in.
Then the drama begins, the guy at the check in counter looks like he hates his life and he asks me about my return ticket to wherever I came from, and today being in this forward world, where almost everything runs digitally I expected the Cairo airport to have wifi, unfortunately I was wrong. since it's a requirement i needed the internet I asked them to share the wifi, very rudely said they dont have internet and apparently they dont use it🙄. Finally an Ethiopian airline manager of some sort came over, was very rude he hot spotted his data so I could finally show him my ticket back to NZ. There it goes again!! To them, the ticket with its refernce number on it, is invalid to them, the ticket I travelled with was invalid!!!🤣🤣 He even tried to intimidate my parents by saying he needed to ask someone in Rwanda to validate whether my parents have been working for 20 years if they are actually settled there at 12 a.m. At the end he made us sign an undertaking because to them we are illegal, for which, he didnt even give us a copy !! I wish I Knen his name, but the name plates were not in English or I would have specifically mentioned the Ethiopian Airline Manager
in short, this would be the last time we use Ethiopian airlines. There is no sense of customer service or even a little respect towards paying customers. They even force you to sign up for sheba miles and if I know correctly, that's a customers choice not a must!!
We could see there was weight adjustment for certain passengers, which could happen only if there was any money transactions (I dont think there is any other explanation to it). where as normal customers were treated rudely like us, except if we were ready to bribe them, which is not happening!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichaA247,Richa A wrote a review Jun 2019,Richa A,"Kigali Province, Rwanda",3 contributions,7 helpful votes,Cairo - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r683606892-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,never ever,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Having little choice, as our holiday provider had changed their preferred airline, we were in fear and trepidation of what we would come up against having read many and mixed reviews. This was a return journey for a safari holiday to Victoria Falls and Chobe National park.
We were extremely relieved and yes pleasantly surprised at what we encountered. Planes were modern and spotless, on time, good seat legroom (in economy), staff were super, food was good for what it is and plenty of choice of entertainment. On a nine hour flight one toilet became unusable due to misuse by passenger(s). Addis Ababa airport was heaving both times we passed through but manageable. Through no fault of EA we were late arriving at AA on our outward trip and made our connection by three minutes - amazingly our luggage also made it too. As said after reading so many negative reviews the build up to our trip was fraught with what ifs but delighted to be able to post this review as we were so relieved at our experience. Part of the trip had poor scheduling but that wasn't the fault of EA, our tour operator must have arranged and agreed it.

"Horrible airline Period! I never flew Ethiopian Airlines before because of the horror stories I hear about lost luggage’s and unprofessionalism of the customer service and lack of minimum organization to run a smooth operation. I gave them a chance and took a flight and they lost my carry on bag. Told me to fill out a form of the items that were in the bag and give them 25 days to find it and if they don’t they will refund me for the lost items. It’s been 2 months and when I try to call they always refer you to the next person and the next person never picks up. This is by far the worst travel experience I have had with an airline in my entire life. This was my first and last flight with this airline.

"It was a horrible experience. The worst in my history of flying to be honest.

First, it is written on the boarding pass that the gates closes 15 minutes before the departure. However, I arrived at the gates 20 minutes before departure time and it was close already. From behinde the glass I could see the crew memeber and other passengers. At this moment, I waved at the crew member,who waved me back to wait. 10 minutes later she returned to me after taking other passengers out. She returned shouting on the cell phone to someone (maybe she had a bad day, but i just lost my flight so I don't care.) She came back telling me you are Nr Aly, correct? (Woth a yellow smile) then she told me sorry you are late.

I showed her the boarding pass saying 15 minutes before departure time and ger inly response was call customer service.

The last one had only one word of you need to prove that and try reaching our office in the airport.

Guess what?? Their office dt Arlanda Airport was already closed at 8:30 am!! Just some minutes after the flight departure time.

"Due to a death of a family member I wanted to change my flight. It took me 14 e-mails, 2 live chats, 2 hours waiting in the live chat, several trials to reach somebody by phone, several hours at the local office trying to get an answer about how fast and for how much I could change my flight and in the end I never got any information about the option of the commercial guesture so that I would not have had to pay the cost of change.

I would like to get an explanation why I needed to write 14 e-mails, most of them were never replied to or there occured some weird understandings of my text, why nobody told me about this manager in charge, why I could not talk to him.

I really hope that no one, who has just lost a family member, ever will be treated like this from your airline.

Please make your words true, inform higher positions about my case to ensure that other grieving passengers can fly back to their beloved ones without this effort.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aroundtheworld111,aroundtheworld111 wrote a review Jun 2019,aroundtheworld111,Luzern,32 contributions,34 helpful votes,Antananarivo - Vienna,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r681408229-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Very unprofessional client service!

"Firstly there is a line everywhere for this airline, line to check in, line to get on plane, line to transfer, line to get ur baggage. If you love waiting in line, this airline is for you! Second, if you want a choice in food, better sit at front of plane because if you sit towards back, they will have just chicken or maybe beef if you are lucky. Because people take like seconds and thirds of airplane food! I mean really?! Trust me it's not that great, they act like they haven't eaten for days. If you want cold drinks forget about it. And unless you want to wait for tiniest glass of water, better buy your own before you get on. Third, if you want to sleep on this long-ass flight, forget about it! Even with ear plugs and eye mask, it will be near impossible because they will make annoying announcements of God knows what every freaking hour of flight in every language possible. If you are watching a movie, be prepared to be interrupted like 100 times before you get to end. If you need to go to bathroom, be prepared to wait, regardless of when it is and don't expect it to be clean or have TP. Just pretend like you are camping and bring your own tissues and hand sanitizer. Well if you're going to Africa this is a must anyway, no offense, they never have TP! Lastly, kids love to run up and down aisles and everywhere on this plane! Parents, air hostesses, no one says anything! So if you are like me, you may end up yelling at them or give them stink-eye more than once!! If you made it to the end, BTW this ain't know cheap flight either $1300 USD, so for that I don't expect first class service, but at least water and TP wouldn't be too mucb to ask. Would I fly again, hell NO!

"My story starts back on March 21, 2019. On March 21st, my girlfriend and I went to buy tickets from Cairo to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian airlines website. The first time we went to buy a ticket the card was declined. We went back to try to buy the ticket again with the same card. This time it took us an hour just to fill out information as our names kept being changed, altered, distorted, and deleted. Eventually to find out, the date was changed too. When we went to pay for those tickets, the card was declined again. We went through the whole process again of names being changed and deleted  and finally paid for those tickets with a different card. That transaction was declined as well. We contacted this exact email address for help that day and there was no response ever. 2 days later we received a confirmation that tickets had been bought. I had to cancel the order on the second credit card so that we would not be charged for two purchases. Why is a purchase being made from our credit cards after the website has reportedly declined our credit cards and ceased the transaction. On April 20th I look at the tickets and through the distress we experienced on March 21st, the tickets were issued for Jul 22nd and not April 22nd. I had spent 3 hours being sent from person to person on phone only to be charged an extra $170 to get our tickets changed to April 22nd on a flight with many open seats, as that is how much more they costed on April 20th rather than on March 21st when I initially bought the tickets, for a problem caused by the horrific user interface set up by Ethiopian airlines and their lack of customer support. My girlfriend and I have traveled across the whole world using many different airlines and this experience with Ethiopian airlines has been absolutely dreadful and by far the worst experience of them all. Ethiopian Airlines has provided terrible care for their customers and all I have been given is one email as their appears to be no person qualified to talk to and provide us the care that should morally be provided. I have requested a full reimbursement on and emailed Ethiopian a total of 3 times, with no responses to any of the emails. This is not right and this is not how customers should be treated. Don't fly with Ethiopian if you want to experience any shred of customer care.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1210CWbend,Ben D wrote a review May 2019,Ben D,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cairo - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r677704790-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The Worst Experience With Any Airline I Have Flown,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I wanted to die.
It was like being in a 3rd world country - from the beginning of the flight the bathrooms were filthy and with no toilet paper or paper towels. The plane was filled with indians on the way to the connection in Addis Ababa and the flight attendants had no control over the cabin. They let kids walk all over the seats and food tray tables, people were yelling and kids screaming. Lots of people out of their seats when the seatbelt sign was on. A guy was pushing and shoving a woman while she was telling me ""you can't do this"". Buttons on the seats and the TV were broken as well as the plugs for the headphones. The plane was disgustingly filthy. The food was prison food too. I could only eat something one I was starving. It was the most UNRELAXING stressful flight I've ever been on.

"I had missed my connecting flight the night before by the proverbial whisker but full credit to the ground staff at Gate 22, one of whom led me to the transit desk where I was instantly offered a night, or what was left of it, at the new Skylight Hotel near the airport. I was also given a temporary Visa to leave the airport, free of cost!
My flight too was rebooked at the same time to the morning departure to Entebbe and then it was on to immigration, prompt service there too and to the hotel shuttle bus service where business class passengers again have priority access.
I opted to have breakfast in the Cloud 9 Lounge so I left the hotel early and passing security and immigration was once again done on the double.
The lounge began to fill up rapidly as connecting and departing passengers enjoyed the services while waiting for their flights to be called and simply going by the numbers entering the lounge it is clear that Ethiopian Airlines premium services are in great demand!
My flight boarded through gate 22 again, dedicated for business class passengers. A bus, picture also shown below, took me and a couple of other passengers to the aircraft and doors closed soon afterwards.
The flight, ably steered by Capt. Abraham Berga and First Office Amanuel Berhanu, left on time and arrived even slightly early in Entebbe while I enjoyed close attention from Team Leader Roza Shiferaw and her colleague Lidya Hadush, who served a full hot breakfast and kept my cup of tea filled.

"We left Cape Town slightly late due to extra fuel needed (pilots announcement) which in the end made me miss my connecting flight to Entebbe.
On board, warmly greeted, did I find blanket, a large pillow and an amenity kit in my seat.
The inflight service could not be faulted if one was a grinch, a perfectly friendly crew who, while my two colleagues and I produced a Podcast and interviews at 35.000 feet, were happy to serve our meal after we were done.
The B777 used on the route still has the classic business class layout of 2x3x2 but the seats are comfortable and extend to a full flatbed.

"I was a bit apprehensive after I booked my flights from Toronto to Seychelles, especially after the Boeing 737 crash.  Actually, my flights were much better than I expected - planes were very clean, food was good as far as airline meals are concerned and services were good.  One concern that I had was with changing planes and flights in Addis Ababa.  It turned out that both connections went without a hitch.  I was impressed that Ethiopian Airlines is working very hard to make Addis Ababa the hub in Africa air travel, and I think they are succeeding - my experience with them were much better than in Nairobi and Johannesburg.  Anyway, a few comments based on my experience: 1. flying to Seychelles from Toronto was much cheaper with ET than other airlines (such as Emirates).  2. Air planes, especially the washrooms, were kept very clean. 3. Seats seem to be slightly more spacious than other airlines. 4. In-flight meals tastes quite good, although they do run out of choices coming to us sitting at the last rows of the plane.  One complaint though is the lack of smiles in the air hostesses faces - they're efficient but not super friendly.  In flight entertainment was below average.  On our return flight from ADD to YYZ, we bid and got business class upgrade.  The service in the business was excellent.  They served many meals and a chance to taste some Ethiopian cuisine and wines. The berth was super comfortable, allowing one to lay down flat with lots of space.  Two complaints though: a) didn't get business class points for my Star Alliance loyalty program despite the ""upgrade""; b) there were multiple lounges in Addis Ababa.  The Cloud 9 business class lounge was like a cafeteria with luke warm food and not enough sitting space for the passengers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/ee/d5/7f/gliderma1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E608NLgregm,Greg M wrote a review May 2019,Greg M,"Toronto, Canada",107 contributions,135 helpful votes,Toronto - Victoria,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r674691414-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Overall - Ethiopian Airlines is better than I thought,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If you fly from your home country to Ethiopia directly or as a connecting flight by Ethiopian airline you can get 50% discount on your domestic flights. This discount is perfect since domestic flights are really expensive.
The discount is not possible to get through internet booking and need to call to one of the sales office of the Airline worldwide but If you are already in Ethiopia you can call to the call center Ethiopia, book your discounted flight and to pay at a bank or at the airport within 24 Hours

Let me tell you.. It's one of the fastest from a to b. Not a long layover. The food and entertainment is very good. Slightly short of Emirates but Much better than the big pretender SAA.

"Airlines keep on changing the time ( more than 5 times) for this trip. Anyhow, the departure and arrival is on time during the trip. Food served well, entertainment was just okey with limited range of movie selection and cleanliness is average. Cabin Crew are not as friendly as my previous flight with other airlines with slow service. Passenger need to bring their own food try after meal since the cabin crew takes too long to clear the tray.

The seat is not really comfy as the cushion is a bit hard and its time to change to new one.

"I was so dreading my flight from the US East Coast all the way to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  13 hours of misery...or so I thought.  Ethiopian Airlines was JUST GREAT!  The 13-hours flew by.  There were free in-flight movies, etc., including recently-released movies.  I recall that they served food 3 times - free, and it was actually HOT FOOD (not those snack boxes they give on US domestic flights that are mostly fake junk) and really GOOD!  The staff on the plane were all super polite and super accommodating.  Even though it was a huge plane, and packed, it didn't feel crowded - maybe there was some additional leg room?  Not sure.  Anyway, I would not hesitate to fly Ethiopian again!

1) plane was very dirty, especially seats. It seems like nobody cleaned it up in Moscow before the flight. Armrest was sticky, may be it was a juice, so it was a sticky spot.
2) Airport in Addis Abeba is an small old terminal, during the connection there was no free seats, everything was occupied, i had to go around the airport.
3) Flight was very long and boring because of the lack of individual multimedia system on a board.
4) As a result price and quality do not correlate.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lenakuznetsova25,Лена Кузнецова wrote a review May 2019,Лена Кузнецова,"Moscow, Russia",10 contributions,48 helpful votes,Moscow - Zanzibar Island,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r672036163-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ожидала лучшего,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am flying regularly with Ethiopian, so this Report will also include my general experience on this airline.

You might be scared by chosing an African airline for Your trip, but intrestingly Ethiopian Airlines (ET) has a much younger fleet than for example Lufthansa and a much better safety rating.

You either might apply to their free of charge ""Sheba-Miles""-Bonus program or collect with any other Star Alliance Airline valuable miles on ET-flights. Interestingly they are having regularly special offers exclusively for Ethiopia itself (for example Jupiter-Hotel group in Addis Ababa).

Due to the recent grounding of B737-planes they have difficulties in running all flights as scheduled, but they are highly motivated to coordinate it in the best way. Unfortunately I got a change in short notice and had a much longer lay-over in Addis Ababa than expected, but got a good and international standard hotel room at ADD Airport for free and they where highly motivated to excuse and make my stay good despite - what succeeded.

The food on their flights is happily different from the every-day-standard meals of (nearly) all the other airlines, which only change their Label on the metal meal boxes, as it feels. Fresh vegetables, good salad, international food and a highly recommended service is offered by the charming and attractive flight attendands. The General variety is average standard (like in other airlines too).

ET has the biggest Network in Afrika, is the biggest airline of the continent, fast growing, reliable and good connected with code-sharing partner airlines. It was the worlds second Airline, flying the new Boeing Dreamliner (787).

I had to call them twice and got a contact quite quick without Long waiting lines, calling directly to Addis Ababa, some of the international numbers, mentioned at their website (Austria, Germany) are not available (anymore? / at this Moment?). Due to a mistake in my booking I also had to email them and got an answer quite quick and was even able to get a non-refundable flight refunded, since they saw that I booked a parallel flight the same Moment.

The baggage/luggage regulation is average standard, even the space in the planes, comparable to all the competitors.

The entertainment system is also comparable and good equipped, with international languages, but I recommend to bring Your own headphone with You, the airlines issues are quite poor (for free).

An on board paper entertainment and information magazine is of high quality with nice stories and good Information of different destinations.

What really make my flying ET regularly is the good network in Afrika, the atmosphere in the planes, the good Service, the good individual Food stuff and the fact that ET is among the most ""on time"" airlines.

And don't forget to register for the free of charge ""Sheba-Miles"" bonus program - it's really worth it and can be used even for car rentals, hotel bookings and other Star Alliance flights.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaryBely,Darya Belyaeva wrote a review Apr 2019,Darya Belyaeva,,8 contributions,4 helpful votes,Entebbe - Vienna,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r669538552-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Right ON TIME, outstanding service, modern fleet!",Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had flown twice before with Ethiopian Airlines, but this was definitely my last.
I find it hard to believe that an international airline can be so bad!!
Where to start?
The staff - obviously they do not enjoy their work, they are unhelpful, and can't be bothered
We stopped in Addis, and I was flying on to Manchester. My boarding pass said the boarding gate was 12, but at the terminal, it stated gate 24. So I go to gate 24, and get up with the other passengers, and we're all asking each other, is this the flight to Manchester??? Eventually we boarded the bus through gate 23.
On making my booking on line, there was no mention of the flight stopping in Brussels?? (where did that come from???) We couldn't get clarity if we had to stay on the plane or disembark.
Supper was served at 01.00 in the morning, and didn't get served any breakfast at all!!!
My gluten free meal had a rice salad, and potatoes served with the main!!!!
It really is time that airlines had a policy about carrying children on the flights!!! We had screaming kids the whole trip, and I even had 2 sitting next to me! Absolutely nothing was said to the parents of all the screaming kids by the staff. I believe it is time to have children free flights, or that it is compulsory for children to be given a tranquilliser before the flight.
No wet wipes given with the meals to wipe sticky fingers
On the flights, there is a gong sounding the whole time, bong, bong, which was incredibly irritating. Did none of the staff hear it?
Announcements were made the whole time in 3 languages. The English announcements were read so fast, and the words mispronounced, that they were intelligible. The volume was very low also.

"Our journey to Cape Town from Manchester went ok, I was our returning journey that the problems started, we bought some duty free at Cape Town international, wine, spirits and beauty products, we had them in 2 of the special sealed bags and were told when buying them that we could carry these straight through to our destination in Edinburgh, we were able to take them on our flight from CT to ADIS Abiba with no problems, but we had to go through security again before our flight to London,we put our bags in the try at security, and a attendant came and lifted our bags and said come with me, he took us to a desk where there was other people that had the same happen to them, they were taking the items out the sealed bags and putting them in separate packages, they wouldn’t tell us why they were doing it nor would they explain to us what the problem was, we said we had to catch a connecting flight at London to Edinburgh so our liquids would need to stay in the sealed bags, it was one of the passengers in front of us that said they were putting them all in the hold, we were told ours would go straight to Edinburgh, they took ages to sort out everything, and gave us Stubbs with a code for the 5 items we had that had now all been seperated from the bags, no surprise when our items weren’t even on the plane going to Edinburgh, £180 worth of our stuff disappeared, been trying for almost a week now to either get our items or get reimbursed but nothing as of yet, we won’t be letting this drop.

"My flight from Addis to Cape Town, ably steered by Capt. Nashom and F/O Abnezer gave me an insight how the Ethiopian Airlines service operates in a near full cabin.
Esete Tedla and Team Leader (aka Purserette) Tisgereda Taye were at their best throughout the 6 hour flight and not once lost their smiles when serving me and 24 other hungry and thirsty passengers asking for more of this and more of that ...
the mettle of a cabin crew shows when they are really busy and the crew on my flight truly was up to the task.
Keeping my glass of sparkling water filled up, another cup of chamomile tea - sadly no honey available explained with a thousand apologies - please explain the Ethiopian national dishes on the menu, can I have another bun please, all responded to promptly and served with a smile.
The cabin of the B777-300ER I traveled in showed a classic Business Class layout in a 2x3x2 configuration, giving 28 seats in C instead of say 24 or less. This no doubt reflects the high demand for business class seats but also allows for the more attractive fares which Ethiopian charges and explains that side of their popularity in Africa and beyond.
My flight must have been near full, when peeping back into Economy I did not spot a single empty seat as far as I could see and while stretching my legs saw that only three seats in Business were empty.
I had in the early hours of the morning arrived from Entebbe and spent much of the transit time in the Cloud 9 Lounge before making my way to the gate which was right at the other end of the new Terminal 2. The lounge, initially almost empty, filled up fast as more connecting passengers arrived and the Ethiopian coffee station was crowded by lovers of Ethiopian coffee.
This was a flight which boarded through an air bridge, so checking through Gate 22, dedicated for Premium passengers, was not an option. I was told Gate 22 was only being used for aircraft parked on apron positions to where passengers are then bussed, important to know for transiting business class travelers looking for the shortest way to their aircraft.
For me it is now more and more how I get to my destination, on time with the least hassles and still having a smile on my face when I leave the aircraft and Ethiopian - this was my 6th flight with them in the recent past - ticks all the right boxes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Apr 2019,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Cape Town Central,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r668477489-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,If I still smile when I leave the aircraft after my flight I sure made the right choice of airline!,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was on the same flight three weeks ago and checked in just around 1 a.m.
My baggage was checked through to my final destination Cape Town and I got my boarding passes for both flights, preferred seat on the EBB ADD service and preferred row on the ADD CPT flight.
Again, despite the wee hours, was the crew at their best. Teamleader Bezawit Taye, assisted by Hachaltu and Rebecca, were courteous and prompt in serving me a full meal at this hour, and on a flight which took less than two hours.
This remains an impressive feature and earns ET high marks!
Arrival in Addis was slightly ahead of time and being first off the plane was I able to fast track myself into the Cloud 9 Lounge waiting for my connecting flight to CPT to be called.
Will elaborate on the lounge experience within the review of the ADD CPT review.

"Ethiopian is one of the few airlines left where service is still excellent and customer friendly. The Airbus A350s are brand new and excellent  aircrafts. Very quiet and comfortable. Entertainment program is good although i usually don't use much of it. Pillows and covers are provided to each seat. I'd always choose Ethiopian again. Only negative point is that my friends traveling with me ordered vegetarian meals during booking process and they never got their ordered vegetarian meal on none of the 5 flights we had with Ethiopian. They got one on request but it was kind of difficult. I have experienced this differently with other airlines, where they have information about special orders and bring those orders to the seat before giving out regular meals. Anyways... Great airline and friendly, warm hearted staff.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caro_on_vacation,Carolin wrote a review Apr 2019,Carolin,"Frankfurt, Germany",11 contributions,2 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Zanzibar Island,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r668370937-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Comfortable flight experience ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight from Jhb to Addis was supposed to be 6hrs, and then we needed to catch a connecting flight to Tokyo the same evening. The first flight was suddenly diverted to Djibouti with little explanation. Then after 3 hours in Djibouti they flew to Addis. The crew did not communicate at all during this time and no one was sure what to do. They didn't even serve extra drinks or food.

But after we got to Addis things rapidly decreased. We were all headed to a help desk with only a handful of people. We stood in a que for 3-4hrs with no food again or help or support. Then we were told we can only fly two days later to Tokyo. There were other connecting flights but the airline refused to book us on them. Then the lady simply walked away halfway through helping us and I had to go beg at a different counter. This was 6am in the morning after arriving at 2am. No one cared. There was no one to help.
Eventually hours later we were put up in a hotel, but didn't have our luggage. We needed to go buy clothes and toiletries and Ethiopian Airlines didn't give any support or money for that. Nor did they try and find our bags.
As I write this we wait to see if we will fly tomorrow. This is by far the most terrible airline I have flown in my life. Never ever ever again. The worst is the absolute lack of caring, not even trying to be helpful. Simple shrugging their shoulders... Can't book us on an earlier flight. Can't find our luggage. Not their problem apparently.

There is very little to add. This is a full service airline which is achieving some very good standards. The business class seats  in this modern Airbus are excellent. The food service is very flexible particularly for the return flight when for most passengers asleep is the priority. When the new airport at Addis is completed then the whole flying experience will be excellent and we would certainly consider using Addis as a hub for joiurnys to other Central African countries.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421SteveP421,Anne P wrote a review Apr 2019,Anne P,"Bristol, United Kingdom",21 contributions,6 helpful votes,London - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r668107643-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A first class airline,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Flying with Ethiopian airlines has been one of those best choices . Friends used to ask me why use ET when your in East Africa and going to another East African  country or going to another place where you can easily connect .All l could say l like  the service and it doesn't matter if l have to go all the way to Addis . This time coming from Cape Town we had only 10mins to connect and for the first time l was 100% sure l would get to Entebbe without my luggage . Wow wow I don't know how they made it or how they did it we all had our bags and we couldn't believe it how fast they transferred  our bags to the flight to Entebbe. We were so happy and over joyed and this is one of the reasons l love flying with ET . Have never missed my luggage or neither have anything stolen .

"After much deliberation, and reading countless reviews, I decided to book with Ethiopian Airlines. What an excellent decision. The planes were new and clean, the staff professional and friendly and the overall service great, The 3½h lay-over at Bole International Airport was a concern but it was better than many other airports I have been through. The food on all flights were more than decent.

With an Airbus A350 from JHB to Bole, Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Bangkok and connecting flight by Bangkok Airways to Phuket (Airbus A320), the 16+ hours in the air plus connecting times, the 28 hours of traveling passed without any incident or complaint.

At the busy Bangkok Airport, an Ethiopian Air employee awaited us when we disembarked to accompany and navigate us to the final boarding gate. He made sure we headed in the right direction, breezed us through customs, ensured that our baggage were booked through and sent us off with his (always present) lovely smile. Now THIS is customer service and added value (for free).

On the return leg, everything was in place again. Because of a flight delay AT DEPARTURE IN bANGKOK, arriving at Bole, we were taken from our aircraft by bus direct to the next airplane to save time - thus skipping all the hustle and bustle of the terminal. Despite the delay at departure in Bangkok, all flights arrived on time or even early.

One negative is the amount of hand luggage that passengers bring as carry-on items. I am sure that the staff tend to turn a blind eye in lieu of good customer relations, but maybe they should be more strict in this regard.

Will I make use of them again - FOR SURE.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/e7/1e/cf/h-malan.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H_Malan,H_Malan wrote a review Apr 2019,H_Malan,South Africa,234 contributions,19 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Phuket,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r668009792-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ethiopian Airlines - Pleasantly surprised,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"From a very courteous check in at Mahe to getting my bags on the carousel in Entebbe first was it a thoroughly enjoyable experience to fly with Ethiopian Airlines. Spending time before departure at the Vallee de Mai Lounge helped to get into the right mindset and once boarded, welcomed by a smiling cabin crew team at the door was it smooth cruising all the way to Addis.
Capt. Henok avoided the turbulences enroute as best as he could and the cabin crew team in business class led by Tseday all played their part to make the flight pleasant, refill cups and glasses and clear plates once I had finished my food.
While in Addis was the transit experience in the new Terminal 2 again so much superior to the old days and the new Cloud 9 Lounge, while quite full, afforded time to sit down with my colleagues who were off to Accra later on and have a final chat with them.
Boarding through a dedicated premium passenger gate was as easy as it comes, a short walk from the lounge, accompanied by a staff member for that matter, through a fast tracked security checkpoint and then are passengers called for their respective flights, taken by elevator to the ground level and bussed to their aircraft. This is a feature not even seen in the fancied airports of South Africa, leave alone Nairobi or my own home airport of Entebbe and earns Ethiopian Airlines high marks! It is the kind of service which earns loyalty from premium passengers!
My flight home was steered by Capt. Benyam Tesfaye and cabin crew team leader Haire Awell and his team served a well booked business class section with professional courtesy and smiles.
As a result of my inflight experience, and a subsequent rather different one on another airline for a trip to Cape Town, I made sure I was once again booked on Ethiopian for my upcoming trip, again to Cape Town by the way, to make sure I walk on and off the plane smiling myself.
Ah, yes, finally, both flights left on time and my service into Entebbe arrived even a bit ahead of schedule.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Apr 2019,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Victoria - Entebbe,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r667736950-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,My flights to and from Seychelles totally vindicated my decision to switch to ET,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Airlines have good clean aircraft with a decent staff.

There was a slight delay in take off. The aircraft was comfortable (Boeing 737) but felt the service a bit lacking. No drinks/beverages were served - the crew did roll out the drinks trolley but just went by without offering to anyone except couple of seats in the front. The food was served almost at the end of the flight and I would advice people to mostly avoid it as it was mostly stale.
The biggest grievance about flying this airline (I flew return also) was that both times they turned off the AC as soon as they landed and that made it very stuffy and uncomfortable.

During each call no one knew that I called before, no notes, nothing. No one had any information on my reservation and the status.

I visited Ethiopia and Zanzibar in December/January 2019.  I had doubts about flying with Ethiopian Airlines however from the moment I boarded my flight from Bangkok to Addis Ababa my concerns were allayed .  From check in until my arrival in Addis Ababa everything was excellent.  The flight attendants were the most helpful crew I have seen for a long time - they went out of their way for the passengers.  I did 6 flights with Ethiopian Airlines but international and domestic and enjoyed every flight.  The unfortunate and sad occurrence of two months ago hopefully will not deter people from flying with Ethiopian Airlines- I think they are up there with the top airlines in the world.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j0yr0chf0rd,j0yr0chf0rd wrote a review Apr 2019,j0yr0chf0rd,"Sydney, Australia",10 contributions,6 helpful votes,Bangkok - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r665980944-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My trip there was horrible as I was put in a seat right next to the bulk head behind the toilet with Air hostesses, banging things and talking through the night as well as people going to the toilet.  Food options for main meals are limited.  The chicken dish offered twice on the same flight was tasteless but the veggie past dish was good.  Some of the Air hostesses were a abrupt with people.  We watched the plane being cleaned when stopping over in Hong Kong for an hour.  Efficient but they do need much more powerful vacume cleaners to do a good job.

"My family and I, consisting of 2 adults, 3 kids (12,10, 5 yr old) flew from Luanda Angola to Kilimanjaro airport with a stopover in Addis Ababa. We have been living in Africa for 7 years and had travel a lot so we didn’t expect the same flying experience from othe airlines worldwide. Departure and arrival times were good, the plane was clean when we board but become dirty pretty fast, I think is mainly due to the people that travel on these flights, the service on board was really good but the food was a bit spicy for the kids. We also learned that once onboard you can not upgrade seats. We also learned that you get a hotel booking if you have a layover for 8 hours or more, you must see website. We decided to book a better hotel than the one offered but If you are offered the newly inaugurated 5 star Skylight hotel don’t hesitate to take it. Once outside the airport we didn’t feel insecure although there was a lot of people around. At the new installations of Adis Abbaba airport there is a lot of confusion, a lot of people and the Ethiopian service clerks try to do their best to help. For visas, we got a single entry visa(50 USD) instead of the multiple entry (80 USD) but somehow on our return they didn’t ask for another entry visa. Overall we would use the airline again if needed, it seems that they are working hard to improve in every sense. We even though about travel around Ethiopia.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadiaMex,NadiaMex wrote a review Apr 2019,NadiaMex,"Luanda, Angola",69 contributions,23 helpful votes,Luanda - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r664212740-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Bare in mind is an African Airline,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew several times on Ethiopian Air starting in Chicago, then onto Addis Ababa, then to Johannesburg.  Then beginning again in Vic Falls thru Addis Ababa onto Kilimanjaro.  Then from Kilimanjaro to Zanzibar and then back to Chicago.  Despite new equipment which was nice and fortunately our plane did not crash while we were on it --you deplane in Addis by climbing down a two story staircase onto a 100 degree tarmac where you are boarded onto a crushingly overcrowded bus and taken to the airport.  There you go through security two times while searching for the location of your continuing flight which is not where they said it would be and no one seems to know where to find it and you have but an hour between flights.The flights seem long for internal African flights, bu that is because they stop at variously  one or two- not told to you on your ticket-- other places.  You are compelled to sty on the plane while they clean it and somehow are supposed to levitate off the floor when the cleaners come around.Then, there are the delayed flights--your flt. is delayed and you hence miss your connecting flight and it is impossible to get any help rebooking the replacement  flight.If you miss--because of their lateness --a flight and have to wait 24 hours for a continuing flight--too bad, so sad--you're on your own for food and lodging.Then another time our flight from Addis to Kilimanjaro via Dar es Salaam was late and they told us us just to get on a flight to Dar and someone will greet us at the gate and see that we get on a continuing flt. to Kilimanjaro where we were to join a safari. more than once in our odyssey through Africa when our flt. was late we were told an agent would be there at the intermediary stop to help us continue our travels.  This never happened.  When we missed a flight with another airline, they told us they had emailed the other airline so they would rebook us without cost and the station agent laughed at us and said ""they told you that""  and we had to pay again for the missed flight caused by Ethiopian lateness (I mean 8 hours late, this was not a tight connection.....We were bemused when we heard other passengers had made up the same song as had we-""Lie lie lie, lie lie lie lie lie lie lie""  These were attractive capable looking agents who would look you straight in the eye and lie.Addis ababa is a horrid, overcrowded airport, with not flight information--no matter your experience or savvy--Ethiopian Air assumes they are supreme and unfortunately their African passengers accept this.  I do not.  If they think they are going to take over African flying, they have a long way to go.  A brand new airport in which a disabled person has to fight with other passengers to be seated on the shuttle, after fighting to get on the shuttle.  A disabled person has to climb up and down a two story stairway carrying their own carry on  bag while doing so...and I could go on and on.  We ended up on this airline because they are a partner of United and we used miles for this trip.  I wrote to United and said they should never subject their loyal members to the treatment afforded by this airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heyou,heyou wrote a review Apr 2019,heyou,Wisconsin,16 contributions,2 helpful votes,Victoria Falls - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r663833622-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Do not expect the truth or any assistance after delayed flights,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am adding my transit experience to my flight review because it is a quintessential part of it.
After my arrival from Entebbe in the wee hours of the morning, was the new Terminal 2 in Addis Ababa relatively empty. Some restaurants were open as I made my way to the Cloud 9 Lounge. What a change from the past I must say, both terminal and lounge. WiFi sprang into life the moment the password was entered, there was a selection of cold and hot dishes available to snack on and eggs were prepared to order. Progressively did the lounge get busy as more flights arrived and passengers checked in for their flights took advantage of the offerings.
Notably was I guided by the lounge staff to Gate 22 - the listed gate of my Seychelles flight was 6, and Gate 22 proved to be a dedicated gate for premium passengers who would be transported from there directly to their aircraft. Now THAT is a great service as it spares one the often long walks if a departure gate is at the other end of the new terminal.
Subsequently did business class passengers booked on the flight to the Seychelles arrive just ahead of the doors being closed, the flight leaving on time. Last on and first off the aircraft was put into effect with precision!
We were warmly welcomed on board by Purserette, aka 'Team Leader' Hirity Asgeoom and an announcement by Captain Andrade rounded up the experience.
Hirity's colleague Gifty did much of the serving and clearing of dishes, glasses and cups but the available Ethiopian National Dishes on the menu were ably explained by Hirity and also served by her, needless to say with a smile and always asking if she could to anything else, refill a glass or add some food.
Besides two starters and a salad were FOUR main courses available as was dessert at the end of the meal, plus a cheese board from which Hirity would cut the type and amount of cheese asked for.

I tried a few sips of the Ethiopian Rift Valley Syrah red wine and, like on the flight from Entebbe when I had a few sips of the Ethiopian white wine, it again had an interesting taste and adding some authenticity to the meal.

I was again happy to have chosen to fly with Ethiopian to the Seychelles, breaking with my past practice of almost 25 flights to SEZ over the past 10 years via Nairobi! We arrived well ahead of ETA and the entire flight experience was producing thumbs up for Ethiopian Airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Mar 2019,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Victoria,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r662580907-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,An excellent transit and flight experience set my mood for the Seychelles!,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Being greeted by name once I sat down in my seat 2A continued an already very positive experience at check in. Purserette Eden Ayele, at ET the title is 'Team Leader' delivered my welcome with a broad smile, at 02.30 hrs not something I have learned to take for granted.
Pushback for take off was on time, though before entering the runway we had to wait for bird control to chase away a stubborn bird which just stood there, not giving way until the vehicle arrived.
Arrival in Addis Ababa was still slightly ahead of time, and the flight itself smooth with hardly a turbulence felt, Captain Abubeker doing a great job of that given the lightning seen in the distance from the windows.
The drink and food service was prompt, delivery again with a smile, also from cabin attendant Samrawit Fikre who served in business class alongside her 'Team Leader'.
At 3 in the a.m. I did not expect to be served a full hot meal, but that what it turned out to be. A choice of two starters and three main courses - I opted for the fish - complemented by a dessert and of course Ethiopian coffee at the end of the meal.
Time just flew by, pun intended, and we were already descending into Addis Ababa.
With my meal I had a good sip of an Ethiopian White Whine, Rift Valley Chardonnay, which proved interesting and went along well with the fish dish.

It was my first flight in a very long time with Ethiopian and I can only say that staff on the ground and in the air were at their very best, despite the wee hours of the night.

"Flying Ethiopian Airlines is challenging at the best of time but when you book a ticket through a Star Alliance member the fun begins!    I booked through SAA to fly to Lalibella via Addis return on a flight operated by Ethiopian Airways.   This meant that I was not able to select a seat online and nor could I check in online because SAA said it was to be done through Ethiopian Airlines and they said it was an SAA ticket!    When flying from Lalibella I tried to book my luggage through to Johannesburg and they said that I was not able to do that because my ticket was fake and they would only book me to Addis when meant I had to claim my baggage, walk through a construction site to reach International Departures to check in which I did with no problem despite my ticket being 'fake'    Ethiopian Airlines is the most frustrating airline to do business with particularly as it is diffiicult (if not impossible) to reserve seats online or to do an online check in.

"Purchase a ticket from São Paulo to Buenos Aires on Ethiopian Official Website and paid with my credit card. Received an email with the reservation right afterwards. Went to sleep. The next day I got an email around noon that I needed to call their office to have tkt issued. Called right away but it was a long wait and I had an appointment. Called again around 3pm and they said they would email me a form with instructions, I had to fill it in, sign and returned to their office in São Paulo Brazil. I did it later in the evening, filled in form, sent copy of my passport and copy of my credit card. Was advised it would take 24 hours to have it processed. 3 days later without any communication from Ethiopian Airlines I sent an email asking for the status and was informed that my reservation had been cancelled 3 days before because I sent the forms and docs after 5pm (which no one told me I was supposed to). So I was supposed to make a new reservation, and prepare a new form .... when I tried price was R$200 more .... $210 instead of $160 round trip.
So I happily purchased ticket with one of their competitors on their website right away without any issues, forms, copy of passport and credit card.
They do not honor the prices they quote. Never ever again.

After eating the same food about four times I could not stomach it anymore.a lady beside me travelling with a one month old was to have a seat up front with a bassinet( which she said she had paid  extra for) but she was told that she could not get a bassinet seat as there were too many babies on the flight .

"This airline made an incredible progress. I flew with them several times 12 years ago on board of greatly dilapidated old planes and, I was now on board of modern airplanes flown by very good pilots ( judging by the way they started and landed). I took 3 flights in 6 days between Addis, Hargeisa and Khartoum and I found good service even the flights were short. One thing surprised me that even the planes were brand new they already had brocken or crooked tables. To me it is a lack of maintenance. Really sad.
The seats were quite standard when it comes to the pitch. I didn’t feel particularly squashed. Certainly no more than anywhere else.
Otherwise the small bun with mortadella as a snack was great. Very original.
Away from dreaded “airplane food”. I do not know if I would fly this airline again especially after what happened recently with Addis Nairobi flight but, it wasn’t their fault at all. So it seems. The new airport was also very impressive, clean, vast, with many stores and services.

"My journey was 10.5 hours to Kigali via Addis Ababa with a one hour stopover at Addis. It was an unremarkable flight with not great seating or a lot of leg room and the food, although acceptable, was not really that good. The flight crew were efficient but not friendly. As I stated, an unremarkable flight. The return flight from Kigali to Heathrow had an unavoidable 5 hour stopover at Addis which stretched my endurance reserves - there are only so many coffees and snacks and only so much alcohol you can consume to pass the time and there is so much going on in the terminal that watching a film on my iPad was a disjointed affair.

Staff were really friendly and helpful. The food and drinks were very satisfactory. Only slight quibble would be with the amenities bag, which has a sightly cheap feel and look to it.

Addis Ababa airport, however, leaves a good deal to be desired. It is undergoing major renovation and expansion. It tends to have security screening dotted around, here and there, and it appears chaotic at times.

"It is with the deepest regret I admit not to have posted this review immediately this Friday. My deepest condolences to all affected by the accident on ADD-NBO today.
My flights on Thursday-Friday this week we're shocking and once and for all confirmed that ET ois not an airline I will fly in the future.
The first flight only proved that processes are not in place, security as such was not visibly an issue. But many passengers suffered because staff did not open toilet after take off, untill I did it myself to the relief of many passengers.
The second flight (ADD-EBB) was a clear demonstration of lacking training and safety procedures and something Star Alliance should consider carefully when admitting members.
After 5 complaints to the staff, just before take-off, about all three passengers in front of me ignoring the Sears upright rule, I was asked to move to an empty seat ion the back row and not disturb/ get disturbed by the non-complying passengers. How does my moving increase flight safety? Should the staff not have focused on the non-complying passengers?
Also, no attention was given to passengers talking on their mobile phones during actual take-off.
These were just visible signs of negligence and bad training - nobody knows what would be found at a professional audit.
My definite boycott of ET (and to some extent Star Alliance) is due to the incomprehensible policy of the airline not rewarding business class passengers one single mile (points) on their flights unless they are Sheba miles members - other Star-members receive nothing!
Avoid Ethiopian and consider carefully whether Star is the preferred alliance - ET is not the only member allowed membership without rewarding members.
Weak performance of both and unfortunately the neglect has now proved fatal.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumene9,Johan wrote a review Mar 2019,Johan,,2 contributions,6 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r657514691-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Neglect and ignorance,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Poker face I guess.But what frustrated me was they lost my suitcase on the way back from BKK-HKG. The ground agent said the tag was ""mixed up"" with another suitcase. I was like WTF, I only had one bag and I was flying direct flight.  Luckily they found it and delivered to me in five days time.  Some minor scratches on the suitcase. Nothing missing or implanted.

My wife and I flew Business Class to Addis Ababa. The plane had seen better days but was still acceptable. Service and food were agreeable. However we experienced a 3 hour mechanical delay during our stop over in Togo. This was nightmarish with the electricity being turned on and off. At several points the cabin became very hot and uncomfortable. Finally we took off from Togo and landed well after midnight in Addis Ababa. Over 3 hours late. From my experience Ethiopian Airlines has many long delays due to mechanical problems.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/7b/dd/4e/inthemomentmanhattan.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InTheMomentManhattan,InTheMomentManhattan wrote a review Mar 2019,InTheMomentManhattan,"New York City, New York",1122 contributions,369 helpful votes,Newark - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r656775551-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Not Great But Not the Worst,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I just returned from a trip to Uganda yesterday. I flew a total of 5 flight segments on Ethiopian Airlines and was in Business/First class the entire way. In all cases the seats were exactly the same. In poor condition and uncomfortable. They were covered with a red fabric that was frayed and loose as in from years of use without being replaced. The seat was not even a flat bed it was the old kind we had in first class 10 years ago where you lie on a telescoping slant.

"I had a connecting flight from Changi back to Kuala Lumpur with Ethiopian Airlines and this is probably the scariest and weirdest flight that I have been on.

If you have been on business class before, there is a small placeholder for bottle and drink between two seats in business class, normally things don’t slip but with Ethiopian Airlines, when we were taking off, everything fell behind. It looks like a relatively new flight but strange that it worked this way.

Fine, that’s not a big deal yet. Half way through the flight (luckily it’s only a 1-hour-flight), we encountered a turbulence. This is the worst experience I have had. The flight is pretty big, seat configuration is 2-2-2 but it feels like we are going through the turbulence with tiny airplane. It was shaky, and at one point, I felt that we were dropping in tandem for about half a minute, I really thought that I would die. Such irony, my long haul flight for 12 hours with two turbulence didn’t even wake me up.

Finally, we had a hard landing back in KLIA. It hurts my back and my head. Tell you what, your money is better spent elsewhere, no more Ethiopian airlines. Better with major airlines like Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa (even though I have episodes with them but compared to Ethiopian, Lufthansa is definitely better), KLM, Turkish or Thai Airways.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/25/0c/b0/6a/charlotterosei.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlotterosei,Charlotte Wan Mei wrote a review Mar 2019,Charlotte Wan Mei,"Shanghai, China",158 contributions,84 helpful votes,Singapore - Kuala Lumpur,Southeast Asia,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r656372019-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The scariest flight I have ever been on ,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This feb, I flew from Mumbai to Windhoek, Namibia on Ethiopian for the second time in three months. As usual, the flight from Mumbai to addis was great, they serve great food, the service is excellent and there is a generous selection of wines and champagne too. The full flat bed that comes on the Dreamliner wasn't there and it was an almost flat bed with the leg going in to a notch - not the most comfortable but yes you can sleep. The second leg as usual started off from the special business class boarding area where they get you on a bus 15 mins before the flight, the flight however was the big disappointment when for the 5 hour flight to Windhoek I found semi reclining seats in business class instead of full flat beds. Service was excellent however. The lounge at Addis Ababa Bole intl airport can do with a makeover especially the washrooms compared to lounges from around the world. My return trip was a bit more pleasant - surprisingly at Windhoek there was no priority boarding for business class - the 5 hour flight again was on a semi reclining seat but the Ethiopian food was gorgeous of course - I had a stopover at addis that night before connecting to Mumbai - The agent at the transit counter first booked me in an economy hotel and then later asked me to change it downstairs where I got changed to ramada. The next day the flight to Mumbai was a proper full flat seat, comfortable flight, excellent spread and of course service. Over the past months I've started to like Ethiopian as my preferred airline to travel to Africa - the perks of earning miles as a star alliance member aside, and besides the hassle of taking the flight from Mumbai, its a great option, there is a long way to go but I am sure Ethiopian would get there",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/a9/7b/f2/sunil-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesagittarian,thesagittarian wrote a review Mar 2019,thesagittarian,"Kochi (Cochin), India",61 contributions,40 helpful votes,Mumbai - Windhoek,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r655927768-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,My favourite airline to Africa but lots of scope for improvement,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had opted to fly Ethiopian Airlines with my parents and spouse from Johannesburg to Mahe, Seychelles with a 5 hour layover in Addis Ababa. The staff/crew of the airline are absolutely wonderful HOWEVER the plane was EXTREMELY dated, had no in-flight entertainment and ventilation seemed poor. I had sat towards the back of the aircraft and noticed that during the flight, 4 people had passed out (and they were not intoxicated). The plane from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa was extremely old - we do not even use those types of aged planes on our domestic routes in South Africa.
The airport at Addis is extremely overcrowded, chaotic and could pose a potential risk to tourists. It is absolutely appalling so be prepared in advance!
The return flight from The Seychelles to Addis was cancelled... eventually. No information was provided by the airline and all passengers had to stay overnight at the airport as the staff members had stated that Ethiopian Airlines would not authorise accommodation costs. We had had enough and eventually flew out of Mahe directly to Johannesburg via Air Seychelles which was excellent in standards and service.

Flight and ground crew of the airlines are polite, courteous and efficient. It is the airplane itself as well as the airport which is a MAJOR deterrent. I will never fly this airline again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/fe/3b/45/ash-nomadtraveler.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ash_nomadtraveler,Ash wrote a review Feb 2019,Ash,"Johannesburg, South Africa",11 contributions,18 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r655554543-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Harrowing and horrendous,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My husband and I  went to join a group of travelers that already were in Ethiopia for 9 days. My luggage didn't show up in Addis so we filed  a claim, then learned a lady in the group lost her suitcase on her way there for 9 days already. She finally had it back the afternoon we arrived. We didn't have it until three days later. No compensation but we were glad that it was only late for three days, instead of 9 days.Toilets in the airplanes are poorly maintained. On our way to Addis, one toilet on my side is completely shut down and the other one had vanity drainage problem so water was filled to the rim of the vanity. I had to go to the other side to use the toilet and it was not clean. On my return plan, the door of one toilet couldn't be locked  so the light stayed green. I went to the other one, also had vanity drainage issue.

"Since our last vacation to ethiopia 4 years ago via Lufthansa, which by the way has an incredible customer service and flight experience, we decided to fly ethiopian to minimize the duration of our flight. In preparation for our long awaited vacation to ethiopia, we decided to reserve a sleeping basin for our 16 months baby, well 4 months in advance of our flight from DC to addis. I  also reserved a seat for my wife and myself side by side. on the day of the flight from D.C., the gentleman at the reservation broke the news to me that, not only there is no basin left for our baby, we weren't gonna be seated next to each other. i calmly tried to explain to the gentleman that these things were reserved 4 months ago. the thought of talking to his superior crossed my mind because i was being treated unfairly but i decided not to escalate things,and kept appealing to the gentleman. he said basins are first come first serve basis, and my reserved seat was issued to another passenger for no logical reason. i couldn't even understand how already reserved seat could be issued to another passenger.I ended up flying trans-atlantic separated from my wife and my precious daughter.

"Our flight in business class on Ethiopian airlines took 2 hours from Manila to Hong Kong with a one hour layover staying on the plane at Hong Kong airport. Then an 11 hour flight from Hong Kong to Addis Ababa with a 3 hour layover and a change of planes in Addis Ababa. Cloud Nine or the business class lounge, was okay with the food and offerings there average.

Then there was a 12 and 1/2 hour flight to Sao Paulo Brazil. Of course regardless of business class, we were wiped out from the very long haul flights. That said Ethiopian Airlines business class can't be beat for their very reasonable and low cost flights. Our Ethiopian airlines tickets were 50% less expensive that all the other airlines business class and we checked the internet very carefully for this. Their business class service was up to or better than the same standards as many of the other major airlines, but not all.

At the end of the day, for the very low cost of the tickets, if you are traveling to or from Africa or South Africa taking a good look at Ethiopian airlines would be well worth your while.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MO782,M O wrote a review Feb 2019,M O,"London, United Kingdom",187 contributions,237 helpful votes,Manila - Sao Paulo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r654305374-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good Service on several very long haul flights,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked award tickets in business class for my wife and I on a return trip from Dubai. Our route was from DXB-ADD on the A350 and then on from ADD-ORD (with a stop in DUB) on the 787.

The ground service in Dubai was decent but nothing exceptional. The contract business lounge was spacious and not overly crowded and had a decent food and drink selection. Upon boarding in Dubai the A350 was nice and comfortable. It had large IFE screens, however the movie selection was extremely poor and the volume was low even at its highest setting. The flight attendants were friendly, however there was no personal attention. Although the cabin was less than half full, the attendants spent very little time seeing to guests. Aside from serving the welcome drinks and meal, they attendants never came through the cabin to see if anyone needed anything.

We departed late and so had to go straight to the connecting gate in ADD. The only nice thing was that Business Class Passengers had a separate bus to the terminal. ADD Airport is old and dirty. we went straight to the gate and there was mass confusion. The guy that was checking documents at the gate was having a hard time and even after scanning the boarding passes he was hand entering information and this was taking about 5 minutes per person.

The seating on the 787 provided a little more room though the aircraft was older and showed the wear a bit more. The 787 had the same IFE screen and same volume problems. While the seats were comfortable on both planes, the flight from ADD-ORD is a 17 hour flight. You would hope for a decent amount of service. There were 10 people in business class including 3 employees who were repositioning.

Once again there was no personal service whatsoever. Not once did a flight attendant check to see if they could offer anything. They did not walk through the cabin with water or anything. There were no in-flight snacks in the galley and at one point I went to the galley to ask for a snack and water. All the flight attendants were gathered eating the cheese, fruit, and crackers that were part of the desert tray. When I asked for a snack they brought me a bowl of crackers that were like oversized Cheerios.

To top it all off, I believe I got food poisoning from the food that was served before landing. Within 2 hours of eating this food I was puking my guts out and had to cancel my connecting flight.

Since we had 3 separate crews (DXB-ADD/ ADD-DUB/ DUB-ORD) It appears that this poor service is a cultural issue with Ethiopian air and not just a random poor crew. I have flown business and/or 1st class on United, American, Etihad, KLM, and Lufthansa and economy class on countless other airlines. I can say without a doubt that this was the worst business class experience I have had and I truly believe that I have had better soft product service while flying economy class on multiple airlines than I received from Ethiopian business class. Aside from the business class seat being way better than economy on a 17 hour flight Ethiopian Airlines was a real disappointment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deamole,deamole wrote a review Feb 2019,deamole,"Nuevo, CA",490 contributions,164 helpful votes,Dubai - Chicago,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r654137365-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Business class seat, economy class service",Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew with Ethiopian airlines both internationally from Dublin and for all our internal flights.  In saying that, I don’t think there is any other option as they seem to be the only airline. However, they are excellent.  The flights all left on time.. They were comfortable and if you have an international airline ticket, you get your flights for almost half price.  This makes travelling around Ethiopia much easier.  In a country where everyone seems to be trying to take money from you for one thing or another, it makes a nice change to have a nice experience like this.

"I recently flew Ethiopian airlines booked through and confirmed by Travelstart.    My departure date was then changed to a red eye flight which would have made me miss the function I was flying to....and then I had to change the dates and all arrangements that I had made.   Then the same happened for my return.  It was not possible to pre-select a seat, check in took ages (despite being there over 3 hours before departure).  Boarding a nightmare as the flight was full and everyone rushed and there were many with huge hand luggage which caused blocked aisles and delayed boarding.   There were no earphones to hear the in-flight entertainment and the seats on the plane were very hard and small.   On the return flight (23h00 departure) the hostesses were sleeping in the back after they had served dinner.   They were friendly, the food was palatable and fortunately this flight was not as full so there was space to sleep.    If you are thinking of travelling Ethiopian Airlines check what plane you will be flying in because some are much more comfortable than others.    Will i fly with them again - yes and I am but have been much more careful about which flight (aircraft) I take and hopefully this time there will not be any changes!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drakeseugenie2016,drakeseugenie2016 wrote a review Feb 2019,drakeseugenie2016,"Johannesburg, South Africa",30 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mombasa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r653613155-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Bitter sweet.,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Not sure I would choose this airline again however if you are going from UK to Ethiopia is a good choice especially if you need internal flighbts as you get a discount.

"Worst experience at the airport in the business lounge. My laptop was stollen when I went to the toilet. Reported to the reception immediately expecting a very quick response through their security cctv, unfortunately the ladies were very slow and reluctant to help. I was promised that they will look into the cctv and find the thief. It's now 6 days and NO WORD from Ethiopian Airlines. I now strongly believe my laptop was stollen by one of their employees in the business lounge! Let them prove me wrong by just showing me the cctv evidence.

"I used this airline for a round trip to Addis/Entebbe,being direct flights!!
It was my very first time to fly this flag.
But,my oh my!!!
What an experience!
Its a short flight.
The flight attendants have to do all activities(serve food and drinks,collect trash,sell inflight items) within the 2hrs or less time,and they end up running around like headless chicken-no,am not even exagerating! And then the food trolley! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 I dont know whether the women who get to push the trolleys are trainees on both flights,but the small food trays end up flying off the trolley,poor women look flustered,no idea what to do!!! I almost took a photo,but felt both incidents were bad enough!

What got me though was,the beans,rice,potato salad that fell being left on the floor(next to my seat),and started spattling to the bag i had placed under the seat infront of me...and passengers kept stepping into the unsightly mess!!! Then i got served one of the small salad packs that fell and got broken,with only a little of it spilled!! Unhygienic! Although,I had a bite of the ""chicken""!! No,i dont know if it actually is/was chicken though,it def didnt taste or look like chicken!!

But hey,
I guess thats how it gets in Economy class??? But i hadnt seen anything like that with KQ or SAA,which i have been using!!
No,i wouldnt recommend it,unless one cant afford another flyer,especially economy class(which most of us use)!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/45/d2/08/santake.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Santake,Santafe wrote a review Feb 2019,Santafe,,260 contributions,60 helpful votes,Entebbe - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r652255055-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,I had not seen this before!!,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff were rude, didn't seem to want to be there and just couldn't be bothered if you were a female.

On the return to Singapore they changed our seats with no explanation why from a row that had an empty seat to being squashed into a full row. The staff were not interested in anything.

I'm not sure if they are racist, sexist or just damn right rude.

The toilets were fine if you got in there first but after this they were never cleaned so were pretty rank by the end of it.

"During an almost 4 week stay in Ethiopia I had 5 domestic Ethiopian flights. They were on time, service was fine and the aircraft were all modern and clean.

Check in was less than satisfactory, with generally way too few check in agents (often just one in the regional centres). Tour group leaders regularly cut the line leaving independent travellers ""stranded"" in the queue. On 2 occasions after arriving early we were one of the last to check in.

"Overall the flight was good, but there were a few problems.  Firstly I would like to commend the counter staff at all airports involved.  My wife injured her knee and had a great deal of difficulty walking, we were very well taken care of.  The problems that we came across was with the actual flight crew and the equipment.  The 777 that we had for the flight from Toronto to Addis Abeba was in need of service.  On both long haul flights one of the washrooms on the plane was non-functional, the seat that I had would not remain in any position besides fully upright and the controller for the lights, entertainment system and call button would function sporadically.  The flight crew were helpful enough, but when they started shift rotations, you would often wait 30 minutes or more if you needed anything.  The shorter flight from Addis to Kilimanjaro was on a brand new aircraft, which was nice, but would have been nicer on the longer flight.

The planes are good - they are high, so are also convenient for taller passangers, the windows are bigger than in other planes (companies) I've flown with, I am not sure  but I also think there is also more leg space (I am tall so this is a big plus in my eyes). The food was ok, but in general I am not a fan of food on the planes, so Its hard to judge. Flight attendants were nice and kind.

"Our journey started in the UK but came to a holt in Addis Ababa, where we were in transit to Mombasa. A technical issue grounded the plane and we were left with very little information as to when we would fly, the times for boarding having been revised five times during our 7 hour delay. Whilst as frequent flyers we wee able to use the lounge the facilities are poor, and as such did nothing to help endure what was a 9 hour layover.this was not what I expected and certainly not what I had paid for. We were not offered any alternatives, including rebooking to travel via Nairobi, just left to our own devices in the hope that they would fix the problem sometime. Shame on you Eitheopian Airways - you’ve just lost a customer. When we return in April it will be with another airline.

"Overall the service on board was good and the Ethiopian food very nice. The problem arose when I had to change my return ticket due to a illness in the family. I hadn’t booked through a travel agent and couldn’t make the change online. The Australian call centre couldn’t make the changes either. So I called the one available international call centre in Addis. 11 times. They don’t take calls from Skype or FaceTime, so it was 70 cents per minute on a landline. I was On hold for an average of 32 minutes each time. As soon as I got them to understand the changes I needed to make, I would be put on hold while they checked the system. On hold for half an hour, then the line would drop out, and I’d have to start again. Finally got a new e-ticket and thought everything was fine, until the day before the flight, when I checked online and did not see the new ticket registered. Another 6 calls, over 2 hours, and I eventually had to pay $578 for the privilege of being downgraded from the business class flight I had originally purchased, to an economy on the last leg from Addis to Mogadishu. I work in Mogadishu and this new direct flight service by Ethiopian should have been a godsend, instead it was a frustrating and stressful nightmare.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gypsymclean,Gypsy wrote a review Jan 2019,Gypsy,,1 contribution,,Bangkok - Mogadishu,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r646898255-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Nightmare to change ticket dates!,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The worst customer service ever
I had a surgery during my trip and after 3 weeks I decided to travel. I asked for a wheelchair on the day of travel in case I need it by calling the local office. The lady who picked up, Lima D'Silva, told me that I would need a medical form for this, but I told her I did not have enough time to get one. She said we cannot issue the wheelchair without it, and so I accepted that I would travel without a wheelchair.

When I reached the airport to board my flight, I was refused to board because the airport staff told me that there is a comment on my ticket that I need a medical report. What I found amazing, was that from my conversation with Ms Lima, it was clear that I would not have sufficient time to arrange for a medical certificate from my doctor .

I had no option but to return home with all my bags packed at 4am and decided to visit the local offices later the same day to sort the issue out. The lady, Lima, refused to accept that it was her mistake. She didn't let me finish my sentences, was rude at every step and went on to tell me that the problem is that I do not want to admit my mistake. I was asked to talk to the manager about this issue at hand, and he told me that when you asked for a wheelchair, it is a must for you to have a medical certificate. And the fact that I called meant that I definitely need it. So what I learnt from Ethiopian is that you are supposed to have this in depth knowledge on what is required, and that the people responsible for providing this information have no liability when they do not do this. I have not used a wheelchair before and I am shocked that they expected that someone would just know this! I was treated as though they have no duty on informing me, as their customer, of what is a must. Furthermore, all the staff did not have the general knowledge on English words.

As if all this was not enough, upon requesting an official letter, stating that I was prevented from boarding my flight, I was outright refused, and I need it as proof for my work leave.

This was a horrible experience and I am terribly disappointed in the treatment and lack of assistance I have received. I believe it should deter anyone from using this airline. My family and I will not be travelling with Ethiopian again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/14/88/28/aliasgher-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliasgherj,Aliasgher J wrote a review Jan 2019,Aliasgher J,,1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r646334079-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Medical Certificate for Travel,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I needed to get home from Johannesburg, South Africa to California. The flight route took us from Joburg to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Dublin, Ireland then to Washington DC. I will avoid this airline the next time I travel because I did not need to go to East Africa and it added time to my flight. Also, we landed in Dublin, Ireland and were not allowed to get off the plane or stretch as it was just a fuel stop and flight crew change. A very rude flight attendant told me I couldn’t be on my phone because we were only making a fuel stop. After flying for 8 hours, since we were on the ground I don’t see why it’s an issue to use my cell phone. I didn’t appreciate a flight attendant being in my face about this at all. When we boarded the plane the nearest bathroom was already out of service. The sign saying the bathroom was out of service was in English and many of the passengers didn’t read English. Even the flight announcements were in Amharic, make a sign your customers can read! As I sitting near the out of service bathroom multiple people asked me if the bathroom was out of order, because they couldn’t read the sign in English! The other bathroom was open but the sink was clogged up and the water was in the sink was splashing all over while I tried to use the toilet. The flight leaving Johannesburg was delayed. We arrived to the airport 3 hours early and stood in line for 2 hours, the flight left late. It was a mess like I’ve never experienced with any airline. The flight leaving Johannesburg late made us arrive late to Addis Ababa  and we almost missed our connecting flight. Airport service in Addis Ababa was a continued mess. We had to go through TSA again, we were separated from our personal belongings because Ethiopian Airlines staff decided to close the line to walk through for our body scan after we had put our purses and laptops, etc  on the belt. When I arrived to DC, Dulles my luggage was lost. Apparently the airline had lost it in Africa. I will be sure to avoid flying Ethiopian Airlines in the future.

Ok, so there were 2 flights from Beirut
separated by a 50 minutes interval.. The first one (our flight) at 2:00 a.m. & the second at 2:50 a.m.. & because this airlines DONOT care about their customers they combined the 2 flights in one, departing at 2:50 a.m. Which made no time for us for layover at Ethiopia Airport (which was 50 minutes).. In Beirut they contacted the airlines and they promised they will be waiting us.. But this was not the case.. We arrived at the same time the flight to cape town departed..
The problem didn't end here.. We went to contact them, so they can arrange another flight for us to cape town on the same day (it was 31 December, & our plan was to spend the new year in cape town).. But all they did was saying sorry there are no flights today to cape town.. & you can be there by tomorrow.. (So we missed the new year eve)..
Then we were obliged to wait for the next trip to Johannesburg.. We were like better something than nothing.. So we planned to spend the new year in Johannesburg.. & they promised us again that our bags will be in Johannesburg.. & when we arrived there the bags didn't arrive.. & then again we have to go to the customers service & ask for the bags.. (So we spend the new year in the airport)..
Then on 1 January at 5:00 a.m. We took the plane to cape town, & again on arrival we could not find the bags.. Then again customer service, & asking for the bags..

So our loss was too huge:
1. Missing new year in Cape Town
2. Missing the chance to have a new year in Johannesburg
3. 1 night stay at a Hotel in Johannesburg
4. Clothes & other essentials

& if you think we are the only people to have this issue, then you are wrong.. As we were contacting the customer service at least 5-8 people were there also at each airport with the same issues (either lost bags, or delayed flights, or or or)
& I realized that they are used to that, & it is a daily issue with this airlines..

It was my first time with this airlines & definitely the last time.. & I do not & will not recommend this flight to anyone..
This airlines should stop operating.. They do not respect their customers..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/2e/c7/8e/bahaa911.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bahaa911,Dr.Traveller wrote a review Jan 2019,Dr.Traveller,"Beirut, Lebanon",98 contributions,30 helpful votes,Beirut - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r645494678-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst flight experience ever,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We checked in online and when we arrived at the airport to check-in our bags, we were told about this permission for the first time. Between the check-in staff and the booking staff of the airline, they had no idea what we needed to do to get the permission to board the plane from Dublin Immigration!

Even though the flight was delayed by an hour, we missed the flight without the permission to board.

"I was very disappointed with flying with Ethiopian Airlines. I know they are turning into one of the strongest airlines on the continent but I didn't see why. The food was not appealing (possibly horrible) and after taking two 6 hour + flights, my kids had emptied the snack bag. The Addis airport was one of the worst I have been to in Africa (comparing it to 14). You must bring cash if you want to eat. The debit machines were all down in the 3 or 4 small restaurants and the ""bank"" sign was for a money exchange, not a bank machine. The smell of the bathrooms and ""smoking room"" was overpowering and we basically escaped to our gate, which was part of their new upgrades and quite nice. I did not find the flight attendants friendly at all. The most positive thing I can say is that seats and entertainment were good and we all slept almost all of the 9 hour flight, thanks to the plane having so many open seats. I have to mention that I was very impressed with the way the staff handled our connecting flight. We were delayed 2 hours leaving Bangkok and were transiting to Accra. The crew met us at our gate and walked us straight to the plane. I appreciated that tremendously so well done for the rescue. I would not make Ethiopian Airlines my flight of choice to get me from Asia to Africa again.

"I took Cheapoair's offer to change my flight to a different Airline at no cost to me because in would get me to Chicago sooner and it would not be a 47 hour flight thru Dubai. I had flown via Ethiopian to Kenya with no incident.

I had two separate bookings with Cheapoair thus my flights were not connected in the Airline system as connecting flights but I had alot of time. We landed in Addis at 6pm and were told the Frankfurt Flight 11:55pm was overbooked when we showed up at the counter for our boarding passes and we were put on the next day flight, 17 hours later. They were a bunch of us sent to Hotel Cyan, a common go to hotel for the Airline in Addis. It has terrible salty food,hard beds.

The next flight we were put in, Addis to Dublin to Chicago 5:40pm was overbooked again! with even more passengers from different flights arriving and finding themselves in the same predicament. At this point the airline begun looking for flights on other airlines *** cheapoair advised that if I did not agree with the airline's options for me (A 3 connection flight 42 hours from the original departure time) the policy and my travel insurance stated that I could reject the ticket for a full refund processed in 30 days and book another flight separately. I did exactly that. I left several passengers at the Airport still struggling to figure out their next flight, some headed for West African nations were not given any hotel vouchers and slept at the Airport floor for 22 hours.

"I chose Ethiopian airlines to fly from CPT to DUB as they were reasonably priced and offered the shortest (not direct) flight.

We arrived at the CT airport on the way to DUB to be handed boarding passes for a connecting flight that departed 25 hours after the ones on our tickets. The lady at the desk tried to convince me that they were the same flight (despite having different flight numbers) she offered me a hotel voucher for our stay in ADD. No thank you very much. Fortunately they were able to get us on to a Turkish Airlines flight that departed 3 hours later.

Our return flight from DUB to ADD changed flight number and departed 2 hours earlier than the one we had booked and stopped in Madrid (again, Ethiopian Airlines didn’t inform us of the change). This added 3 hours onto out return flight and made for a short (1 hour) layover in ADD.

The airport in ADD was horrendous. We didn’t have to check in as we were in transit but it was hot, crowded, terrible signage, no lounges, restaurants or decent bathrooms in site and the public internet was a joke.

The one hour layover turned into a 2 hour layover as the flight from ADD to CPT was delayed (which sounds pretty common) but we’re just glad to be back with all of our luggage.

"I ended my previous review of this airline by saying ""you get what you pay for"", but in our return journey we didn't even get that.
We checked in on the first leg of our 37-hour trip using GOL airlines to fly to the first stop of the journey (Sao Paulo) where we were going to join an Ethiopian Airlines flight to Addis Ababa and then take another Ethiopian Airlines flight to Bangkok our destination. At checkin, we did not get boarding passes for the Ethiopian Airlines flights, but the agent apparently contacted Ethiopian and said that we would get them at Sao Paulo, writing a pass that was attached to our GOL boarding pass. Our luggage was checked through to Bangkok correctly, so we thought that collecting the boarding passes would be no problem.
On arrival at Sao Paulo our names were called prior to the flight and we went to the Ethiopian agent to be told that the flight was overbooked and that our tickets would not be honoured. We protested, and were told that we had to wait to see if seats were available and that they probably would be. Despite being the first names on the list of other passengers that were also in the same situation, we saw others who arrived later receive tickets for no apparent reason; and despite continuing requests for the airline to honour its contract with us, the flight departed without us. The next flight was 24 hours later. This was a disaster for us, as my wife who is a school Principal would miss the vital first day of term, seriously affecting her job. Eight other passengers were also kicked off the flight for the same reason and we were put up at a transit hotel at Sao Paulo to wait for the next day's flight.
We were told by the manager at the airport that attempts would be made to get us on another airline to ensure that we arrived on the scheduled day, but we saw no evidence that those attempts were made and I had to call other airlines from the hotel to see if there were any available flights that got us to Bangkok on the Sunday we were supposed to arrive. I was not successful, and we turned up the next day to join the Ethiopian Airlines flight out of Sao Paulo well in advance of the required time. On the previous day, we had received boarding passes all the way to Bangkok, so we assumed that at least there would be no problem with this journey.
We were wrong. Our boarding passes were rejected because they had been issued on the previous day, and it looked like we were going to be delayed for another 24 hours. Fortunately, a passenger whose mother was ill turned up at the desk to hand back their tickets, and we got those and departed on the flight. No explanation was given for the second potential non-journey or why we as delayed passengers were not given priority on the flight since our seats had been selected on the computer in front of us by the agent on the previous day. We were given a voucher for $400 each as compensation for the overbooking delay and told to get it redeemed at Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airline's hub and headquarters.
We arrived at Addis Ababa and went to the office at the airport, meeting passengers from other Ethiopian flights who had had similar overbooking delays and were also trying to get their compensation. The office said that they had no money and that we would have to enter Ethiopia, go to the ticket desks at Arrivals to get paid and then go back through passport control to get our connection to Bangkok. This would have been very unwise as it is unlikely that the passport control officers would have let us through for one hour for a purpose that was neither tourism or business and we could have ended up stranded and missing our connection, so we decided to try to get our money from the Ethiopian Airlines office in Bangkok on arrival, further adding to our delays. We had to get our taxi to take us in the opposite direction from our previously-arranged trip to our home in Thailand, costing us 1000 Baht extra to go to the office where we did get our compensation (only 50% of the $400 as we wanted cash, not a voucher for another Ethiopian flight).
Incidentally, the flights were OK, with none of the problems we encountered on the outward journey.
However, our luggage had been damaged (again) and the presents my wife had put in the cases were partially crushed, while the wrapping around one of our cases had been torn off.
Ethiopian Airlines have obviously been deliberately overbooking their flights to guarantee full aircraft, regardless of passenger contracts for on-time journeys and with no concern for the distress and actual damage caused to those passengers.
If we had the money for lawyers, I would be considering legal action to at least censure the airline for this disgraceful attitude, but our resources sadly do not allow us to do that however satisfying it would be.
All I can do is detail our and other's experience with this airline and recommend that potential passengers consider very carefully whether they should risk their journey with them, especially if on-time arrival is important.
I can only repeat my promise that I will never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simadman,Simadman wrote a review Jan 2019,Simadman,"Asuncion, Paraguay",13 contributions,10 helpful votes,Asuncion - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r644430010-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Greed ruined our trip,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This journey started off as a decent one, until certain things started happening.

My flight from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa was the longest (5:30 hours). But we flew a small Boeing 737, with no entertainment system! It was a tortorous journey. The second leg from Addis to Abuja (4 hours) was better.... The entertainment system was modern but with limited options, most especially with African entertainment. There's so much room for increasing the number of quality Nollywood movies. Only B-class trashy movies were available; I couldn't watch.

The food served was the usual airline food. Not the best, but fills the stomach.

My ultimate disappointment for this airline has to be that, my luggage didn't follow me to Abuja. I was told it'd come with the next flight which would be same time the following day. That would've been okay if I stayed in Abuja, but I had a flight to catch to Ilorin in the next hour. The lady assured me that the luggage would be delivered to my city.

I got a call the next day that my luggage arrived, and I should come pick it up in Abuja! I told the man on the phone what was promised me the previous day and he said he doesn't know anything about that. This got me really angry. I started calling and emailing all ethiopian contacts on their website. Eventually they agreed to put it on a flight to Ilorin.

I was called to pick up my luggage at Ilorin airport after 2 days....The lock had been tampered with and the luggage now looked ugly with scratches and dents.

I'm not sure if I'd fly Ethiopian airlines again....but I like to support African businesses.

- Flights were on time, plane was clean, food was fine, personnel was helpful and friendly and our luggage arrived with us
- Bole Airport: Our layovers here were very short and was handled fine, bathrooms were clean (could use more more water points for passengers)

I along with my Friends Flied in this Flight on  04.01.2019, I ordered for Vegetarian Foods only while Booking my Tickets. Because of they have not Mentioned in the tickets the same, the Vegetarian Foods are not given to me by Cabin Crews and they explained that they can provide me only Non-Vegetarian Foods such as Fish or Chicken. After my argument with them for a long period of time, then they searched for availability of Vegetarian foods and gave away me Pasta.( The Inconvenience caused to me like people is only by the Booking Authorities not by the Cabin Crew members is to be noted so that here after while booking all people  can take a step to ensure that your desired Meals is printed on the Tickets )",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/00/6c/d7/spsbabu1971.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spsbabu1971,Suresh B wrote a review Jan 2019,Suresh B,"Tiruchirappalli, India",101 contributions,14 helpful votes,Bamako - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r644172958-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A Good Voyage with this Flight but Less Satisfaction,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My pregnant wife and I really had a horrible experience flying with this airline.
For starters, the long leg of our flight, 5 and a half hours, was spent in a small 737 without any entertainment with seats that were in tatters and with airhostesses that were really rude (dropping soda cans on you without so much as a ""I'm sorry"") . This all could have been forgiven however with my wife being 29 weeks pregnant, she was cleared for flying however naturally uncomfortable in a plain. The Airline made NO EFFORT what so ever to make her flight more comfortable, even though bigger seats were available in business, no offers were made, they didn't even check in on her from time to time as should be protocol. I will add that my wife did ask for their assistance and the look of disbelief on the airhostess was just ghastly. As if ""how dare she ask"". God forbid we have to fly with Ethiopian Airlines again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanf298,Dean F wrote a review Jan 2019,Dean F,Melkbosstrand ,13 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r643994565-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Extremely disappointed in this Airline. ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Hong Kong to Lalibela via Addis Ababa. On my arrival early morning that day, my luggage was not in the same flight. I was told by the airport staff that it may come on the next flight, due to ""operational convenience "". Contrary to all other airline companies that I flew with , the Ethiopian airlines did not give me any document, and just told me if the luggage did not come on that day, I could make an ""official claim"" in the office in town. They also told me that the luggage would be delivered to my hotel once arrived.I believed them and went sightseeing. I  checked with my hotel in the afternoon (2 hours after the supposed arrival time of my luggage). The hotel staff told me the luggage came but as I was not there, the deliver men  took it to the office in town. At that time, I had only 20 minutes  before the office closed to fetch my luggage. I managed to arrive the office within 10 minutes and found that the zipper ring for holding the  padlock of my bag had been  cut and the bag had been searched as a pouch attached to the inside also came off, and a metal accessory of one side of the bag was torn and nearly came off, showing a hole in the side pocket of the bag. I asked the office staff to register these damages and gave me a document. But they refused,and considered the damage was minor. I told them I could claim my insurance if I have such a document from them.but the supervisor Mr Michael Fekele refused again and told me to contact their office in Addis Ababa as this incident took place in Addis. I had no other way but did what they said. The luggage service office in Addis could not help me as they said damage claim could only be made at destination.So, no one was willing to deal with my case, even though I managed to contact the manager Mr Fikre and asked for help. He accepted Feleke's ""obervation"" and ignored my evidence for the damage.I was totally disappointed with their service. They don't care about customers because they are monopoly for domestic flights. But please reconsider again if you want to take this airline for international segments, as they will not compensate any damaged luggage, and will not even admit that it happened.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meg0210,meg0210 wrote a review Jan 2019,meg0210,"Macau, China",25 contributions,5 helpful votes,Hong Kong - Lalibela,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r643955547-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Refusal for the damages made to my luggage,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The airline itself was pretty average, nothing to complain about but at the same time nothing to say to praise them. The airport, however, is another matter. Firstly let me make it clear that we have never checked in here, and this review is based purely on our experiences as a transit passenger.
The first thing you notice when walking into the terminal building is the amount of reclining seats... practically every bit of available space on every wall you will find one. If however, the time you are going to be spending there between flights is 7.00 am to 11.00 am it's a challenge to find one available.

Most of the staff seem to be on some kind of power trip as well, for example, I was physically blocked from leaving a duty free shop the way I entered, instead being forced to follow the arrows marked on the floor right around the shop to the exit. Then came check in security. The cigarette lighter that had been in my pocked for the whole of the 7 hour flight from London was confiscated for the short hop to Nairobi.

WiFi is non-existent here and using either Kenyan or UK mobile data is an expensive option. My advice... take something to read for the duration of your stay",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/79/f3/80/supeter.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Supeter,Peter_n_Esther wrote a review Jan 2019,Peter_n_Esther,"Cheshunt, United Kingdom",47 contributions,26 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r643937825-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Addis Ababa Airport,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelled from FRA to KGL via ADD and BJM on 3-4 January 2019 on A350-900 for the first time – and 737 on the regional flights. Check-in in FRA was not easy, neither on line nor in Airport and I got a bad seat in the middle of a middle section 1 row away from the rear toilets – sat in 46 F. However, they granted me space of two seats as 1 passenger did not show up. Flight full and almost on time. In Addis, busgating from remote stand took >50 Minutes to disembark the aircraft as they only provided disembarking from a single door in front. Furthermore, they provided only a single bus at a time for 300+ passengers. In FRA they failed to print out my second BP, this often happens with ET and is very annoying as one has to queue up again in Addis to get the second. In ADD, I went to Cloud Nine Lounge though I am at present ineligible without elite status and on economy ticket. However, the lounge reception were kind and let me in meanwhile they upgraded from economy to business for 15,000 miles for next leg to KGL over BJM. Cloud Nine Lounge was nice, X-mas decorations and only half full. The last trip became much more pleasurable and peaceful than the first one though on a much smaller, modest, noisy aircraft. Departure champagne given. No IFE, no service on BJM-KGL due to laxity, cost-saving, or false claim of ""risk of turbulence"". Luggage arrived perfectly after having traveled 6 legs prior to final destination.

This was hard to correct as it was Christmas day and all offices were closed. One we got that straightened out (3 hours with online chat) we decided to go to the airport early to make sure all was okay. They then moved us back to the original flight and my children were not sitting with us. We were spread across the plane. They decided to upgrade us to business class.  Okay, that's good.

"I flew several times with Ethiopian Airlines in December 2018 / January 2019. I flew one-way international from ad Dammam, Saudi Arabia to Addis Ababa, domestic roundtrip from Addis Ababa to Axum, from Addis Ababa to Bahar Dar, and from Gondar to Addis Ababa.  I had heard that Ethiopian Airlines was very good - the best in Africa.  They're better than some, not as good as others.  The check-ins were efficient, the stewardesses were proficient and friendly and helpful.  Cabin cleaning between flights leaves a lot to be desired (training?, supervision?).  Landings were smooth. My flights arrived on time.  They didn't lose any luggage. Here's the best - if you travel to Ethiopia aboard Ethiopian Airlines retain your boarding pass because any domestic flight you subsequently book qualifies for a substantial discount.  You'll need to provide the boarding pass to qualify for the discount. It's a super program.They're opening a brand-new international terminal soon.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/5e/4f/6d/john-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6709XYjohnm,John M wrote a review Jan 2019,John M,"Sarasota, Florida",340 contributions,103 helpful votes,Dammam - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r643776184-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"If You're Flying to Ethiopia, Fly Ethiopian Airlines",Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was looking forward to flying Ethiopian Airlines as I heard it was the best African airline to fly. First impressions were not great, the aircraft to ADD was old and not in great condition.  Service was satisfactory, food was average and the entertainment system likewise. All of this was okay but the real nature of the airline was to reveal itself when my bag was lost. How this happens on a single leg flight is beyond me and you can guess it was stolen when it arrived at ADD. The follow up assistance was appalling.  No calls returned and no one did as they said they would. It was near impossible to get an answer on what was happening when I was there and when I returned to DC. I have had bags in the last 40 years of international travel mishandled (it is a fact of life esp. on multi-leg flights) but having one lost on a single leg is beyond negligent.

"Ethiopian Airlines brands itself as “The New Spirit of Africa”.  Well, judging by Addis Ababa’s dingy, inefficient airport, Ethiopian’s overcrowded business lounge, and the worn-out appearance of our Boeing 777-200 (ET-ANP), that spirit is lacking.  While I credit the cabin crew for their pleasant demeanor, the airline has to seriously upgrade its act at the airport and promptly retrofit its 777-200 fleet.  Our aircraft was only 8 years old, but it looked a lot more tired and worn-out in the business class compartment.  My seat, though it reclined to fully-flat, made really strange noises and the divider between the seats kept popping up.  Safety-wise, many of the lights that indicated that the seats were in the full upright position for landing were not working.  With such superficial issues, one begins to feel concern for the things that one cannot see...  And to think that they use this aircraft for flights across the South Atlantic to Brazil!  ET is trying and it is expanding.  It will need to insure that as it tries and expands it offers a consistently good and reasonable appearing products.  Why can Ethiopian not use its new A350’s on its South Atlantic services???",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/44/9c/fd/tamarindwalk.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sergeg336,Serge G wrote a review Jan 2019,Serge G,"Makati, Philippines",256 contributions,162 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Frankfurt,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r643016338-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Aircraft in need of interior update/upgrade,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well i was travelling from Kenya , Mombasa to India, New Delhi, so my best and wow experience starts from ADDIS ABABA, where a fellow passenger was accompanied by a sick person travelling for some medical treatment in India, soon as the person was sat by the support staff from the wheelchair, A lady wearing traditional Dress different than the other staff, (Senior Crew Member) offered glass of water to them, Wow, than to the Passenger who is sick, and this is still the boarding is going on,now the passenger was comfortable as he had to support his neck with the provided small pillows or cushions in Economy class, she was noticing this all discomfort he was going through, she immediately picked on from the Business class and offered him , he was happy to have it.
Well to my surprise this was a common sense and to sense the need of the guest or so called passenger on board, the young lady totally nailed the all GO OUT OF THE WAY EXAMPLES, anyone could display.
The lady need special recognition for the act, i am sure about she deserve to be wearing the Different Dress than others must have come across such more memorable and effective kind Gestures.
Now why i was so interested to write this for which didn't happen with me or not for me, well i am in a hospitality business, train people to touch people life with any best possible opportunity to endure on.
Should this section of Reviews of yours is handled by professionals please do give my special TAP of appreciations for the asked lady.
Best of luck to her and the Airline too.

"It was the first time I flew Ethiopian Airlines and this has been my last time. They don’t communicate to the passengers when they run late or make any flight changes. Our flight from Washington Dulles was supposed to leave at 10:00am Dec31, 3018 for Adis Ababa. It departed at 11:20. We had a connecting flight to catch from Addis Ababa to Johannesburg, departing at 8:20am Jan 01, 2019. Because the Washington flight departed late, it was meant to arrive at Addis Ababa at 8:15, meaning we were only going to have 5 minutes of transfer time. To our surprise and disgust, after landing at Addis Ababa we found that the Johannesburg flight had already departed, whereas we had notified the flight crew before leaving Washington that they need to inform the Johannesburg flight crew to wait as we have been delayed. In the mist of all the chaos trying to find who can reschedule our flight to Johannesburg most of the ground staff at the airport we’re clueless. We spent about 40 minutes trying to get help. Eventually, after requesting to talk to the supervisor, we were booked on a 3:15pm flight to Johannesburg. We were given a voucher to go to the Lounge, buy boy oh boy, I’ve never seen a lounge serving such horrible food.
Anyone who considers flying Ethiopian Airlines need to think twice. Their prices might be cheap but that goes hand in hand with their beyond terrible service.
I’ve uploaded a picture of the many people who got stranded because they missed their flights due to a delayed flight they flew on earlier.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennym382,kennym382 wrote a review Dec 2018,kennym382,"Pretoria, South Africa",5 contributions,3 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r642763209-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst airline,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was my first trip to Eritrea so I was not sure what to expect with the flights in and out of Eritrea. Overall the flight was excellent. No problems were encountered and the flight was quick, safe, and smooth. As always the ET staff were great.

"Don't use these guys if you have a time-sensitive trip or connecting flights with another airline.

The overall passenger experience is not bad considering what you're paying, but the logistical aspects of the journey can be a nightmare to deal with.

Flight schedules can change several times before the flight. For us it was just flight numbers and departure times, 10 minutes earlier for one flight, an hour earlier for another. The call centre is their strong point, call them to ask about your flights often. Don't rely on the website, when it does work the info is usually outdated.

When we arrived to check in for our return flight, the second leg of our journey was listed as a ""restricted leg"". This meant we could only check in for half of our flight, and neither the lady at the check-in counter or the person in the call centre could tell me why. This was complicated by our 1h45m layover suddenly becoming a 55 minute layover.

Overall it wasn't the worst experience, we got to our destination, our luggage arrived unharmed and on time, and the food was decent.

For me however, I'm done with Ethiopian Airlines, even if it means paying double to fly Emirates in the future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karel225,Karel225 wrote a review Dec 2018,Karel225,Bahrain,12 contributions,1 helpful vote,Bahrain - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r642587316-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Don't rely on the flight schedule if you book more than a day in advance.,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me start by saying Ethiopian airlines never tells you the truth about the situation . When I arrived the boarding gate I noticed my flight was not full I immediately got concerned that we would be shunted to a later flight. Just as I expected we were told the flight had mechanical issues and would leave in 2 hours. That of course was a lie . After a series of heated discussions we were finally booked in a hotel. As we were put on the next flight 9 hours later. Bear in mind we spent over 3 hrs trying to get to the truth.
This airline is okay as long as there are no issues otherwise the staff are unhelpful and do not update you on any progress.

It is nice to fly with airlines operated by people from the continent that you are planning to visit because the vacation starts at the departure gate.

"I flew Ethiopian Airlines from Lagos to Dubai in December 2018 and I was certainly not disappointed.

It was a business class flight all the way and o was impressed with the service offered on the flight from the friendliness of the attendants and willingness to help as I was traveling with limited mobility.

The leg room on the business class seats on the flight from Lagos and Addis Ababa were good and whilst the flight from Addis offered a slightly smaller plane (A350) compared to that from Lagos (777-300), the A350 is a fairly new plane and is quite comfortable.

Two issues which I was not particularly happy with were the incoming meals to Addis. Was in my view not very tasty and somewhat poor quality but outgoing from Addis, it was much better even though I have had better. Then the way the drinks are served is a bit of a challenge to ask for more. Spirits are poured out from larger bottles and asking for a refill can be a bit of a burden. Smaller containers will be helpful.

Overall, Ethiopian Air offered a good and much cheaper choice than the conventional Airlines. Will certainly fly them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/02/3b/9e/dupri00.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dupri00,Dupri00 wrote a review Dec 2018,Dupri00,"Lagos, Nigeria",167 contributions,97 helpful votes,Lagos - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r641953206-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Not disappointed ,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew return as well from JHB back to Bangkok. One of our party was veggie, but didn't really get a veggie meal. All of us got something different for breakfast, but when my friend asked for a different meal as she had got something quite ethnic and she wasn't keen on that for breakfast, so wanted what I got which was eggs , she was handed her new meal and told it was pasta... we laughed about it. about 10 minutes outside of Cape Town a Chinese tourist opened a container of durian. I think the staff maintained a good humour about it.. the trip back was a bit more riddled with hurdles. We tried to do an online check in the night before, but the website wouldn't let me check in, although the other two went fine. It also wouldn't find the second leg of our journey. Calls to the help desk were a waste of time.. the chap couldn't do anything, except get me checked in for the first leg. We got to the airport and were informed that we had been taken off the second leg of our journey due a glitch.We were fine, chirping away and the staff were apologetic and helpful. The lady at the check in desk was super accomodating.. we didn't realise it at the time, but as the flight wasn't full, she had booked us a row each for the longest leg, so we were able to lie down..I could have hugged her!!

"Dec 18 2018, flight was supposed to be Johannesburg-Adis Abbaba-Dublin-LAX. Just before boarding in Johannesburg we were given some “voucher” of an overnight stay. No explanation given as to why overnight stay. They booked us at some Global Hotel in Adis Abbaba. The transportation to the hotel was horrible, no one available to explain anything to us. The next morning we were driven back to the airport. According to our itenerary from Adis Abba we were supposed to go via Dublin to LAX. To our suprise whilst in the air the plane seemed to not be going to Dublin, but rather to Lome (Togo). No explanation given for the detour. No explanation given as to when we’ll be landing at LAX. Food - horrible!!! Had rice with chicken four times. No breakfast even though we left Adis Abbaba at 8:20am. No snacks, no sandwich. Worst staff, who don’t seem professional, and are not knowledgeable. As if that wasn’t enough, our return flight from LAX to Joburg is scheduled for Dec 30, 2018, by incident I logged in to confirm the seats. Only to find that flight now shows Dec 31 2018. No one from Ethiopian airlines had notified us of the changes. We then called the USA office to enquire about the unannounced changes. We were told the flight schedule has changed and we can only leave on the 31st.  We refused to leave on the 31st as ee have a planed booked from Joburg to Cape Town on Jan 01 2019. We requested to speak to the supervisor after the call centre agent seemed not helpful. The supervisor re-issued us with new tickets of flight departing LAX on Dec 31st but flying via Washington first instead of Dublin as was originally booked.

"I'm writing this as an experienced travel agent and a brother who booked my sister's flight as a surprise visit for our family over the festive season.

Let's start with the facts.
According to my sister and all my clients who also travelled with Ethiopian Airlines, the food, service and on board entertainment is 3* and it marches the price you pay for your flight.

The airport in Addis Ababa and their ground staff is pathetic to say the least. Even though they try to accommodate you with alternative options, hotel accommodation and vouchers, it just doesn't make up for valuable time on a pre planned holiday or valuable time spent with family.

As a travel agent I will not recommend or sell this airline again.
Their connecting times are horrendous. My sister will have a 15 minute layover on her return flight. How can that possibly be manageable?!

I'm sorry to say it but I would gladly spend more money for a safer option as 46kg luggage is not worth this mess.

My sister will now be waiting 24 hours for her luggage after it was delayed which is also pathetic as she had to overnight in Addis Ababa.

My experience as a travel consultant with Ethiopian Airlines is just as dismal. They never pick up their phones, take forever to answer emails and no representative has visited our store in more than 3 years.

If you have a very limited buget and don't mind missing your flight or have your luggage delayed this might work for you. Don't expect a first world airport, in fact it's the opposite of that.

Hopefully my review would help your decision before you book your next holiday or flight with Ethiopian Airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/97/be/eb/petrie007.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Petrie007,Petrie wrote a review Dec 2018,Petrie,"Brackenfell, South Africa",9 contributions,3 helpful votes,Seoul - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r641124169-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A Family holiday ruined,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had 2 flights with Ethiopian. The first one was late. We ran through the airport at Addis to get on our connecting flight, and only just made it. When we got to Johannesburg, our luggage hadn't arrived. When we got to our final destination after connecting at JNB (different airline), no luggage. 2 days later: no luggage, and they couldn't find our luggage on the system. Not a complimentary voucher, not an apology from Ethiopian. Only when I sent an email did I get any response.

The food on board was mediocre to poor.

"I have been using Ethiopian for many years, mainly the above flight but also India and Nepal.  They are still very good however I wonder if they are slipping following past successes (following the KQ journey).   The plane from Mombasa to  Addis was old and poor including ripped upholstery; the ""high lift"" I waited for circa 40 minutes.  Immigration is getting slightly ridiculous; they had a new radar screening process which clearly didn't work because they then searched everybody, they take every single cigarette lighter (I have travelled a lot but NEVER faced that) and I had to remove sandals which had no metal nor any ""hiding places"".

"The perfect nightmare of an international traveler:  1.       Payment issues. We booked the ticket through Expedia, and to cut the long story short it took about a month to get the confirmation that the fee was actually charged and we can fly.2.       Flight experience. The planes are old and messy. The seat cover looks like a rag from the 19th century. The toilets were unusable towards the end of our 16h flight. No one cleaned them during the flight.  3.       Addis Ababa airport. Is a makeshift construction, where the doors of the smoking room remain open and that makes the whole wing stink with cigarette smell. The toilets were dirty, and when you flush it the water, it spills all around. Although there was a cleaning lady in the toilets and the jar for tips, the trash bins were overflowing, no soap and no hand towels. There are no working ATMs, so you better have some cash on you, as the coffee shops do not accept credit cards. Hygiene and customer service were not to be found in those coffee shops. On our way back, they changed the gates a few times, and there were no proper announcements made, so the staff directed us some time to the opposing ends of the airport.4.       Luckily, they have on-line registration. However, even a boarding pass in your hands does not guarantee that you will get on your flight. When I came to drop my bags, I was requested to present a yellow fever certificate to return to my destination. In my experience, the airline as a courtesy informs you of any health or admin requirements that a traveler may not be reasonably aware of (like a shot before you return to the country of ORIGIN). They refused to board me on the flight, and the fee to change the fight was a full fare. Don’t be fooled by their cheap prices, you may end up paying twice!5.       In addition to that, the promised refund never came. When applying for a refund, bear in mind that you will need to liaise with your booking agent, bank and payment system to demonstrate that you have purchased the ticket from them. They told me that their record showed that ticket was never issued, although we were charged, and actually flew! It takes a 20 min wait to reach a person on the helpline, and after another 20 minutes the line will be cut off, and you will have to repeat the whole process again.In conclusion, if you really hate someone buy them Ethiopian Airlines ticket.

"Travelled Ethiopian airlines recently with my toddler. Flight was good as such. At check-in they did not print the boarding pay for second half of my journey but they printed it for my son. I noticed this at the gate and was told that I can get the boarding pass at Adis Ababa.

ADD airport was a mess. Only 2 attendants were printing the passes and were very slow. I met a person whose flight was leaving in 30 mins and she was standing in line to get a boarding pass. Security was a mess, chaotic and long lines. Good part was that they were calling for people on certain flights that were leaving in 30 mins and we were rushed through security.

I was happy until this point and the flight was ok. Flight attendants did not pay much attention outside of food service time. I had my jewelry in carry on bag with me and still somehow my gold jewelry was stolen. Unfortunately I realized this only when I reached my destination and started to unpack later that night. I will say Take Care of your valuables and keep them in sight all the time on this airline. I have travelled on various other airlines with jewelry and never had this issue.

"Where do I begin? The entire experience with Ethiopian Airlines has been downright awful. Firstly 5 hr delay in departing Chicago (connection point stateside), which meant that we missed our connection in Addis for Kilimanjaro. We were told that we would be rebooked on a PM flight on Kenya Airlines from Addis to JRO but when we arrived to Addis, were told that the Kenya Airlines flight was full. In Chicago, we asked to be rebooked to another route but were told that that is not possible until flight is canceled and this flight is not canceled but delayed. We were forced to spend the night in Addis and wait for the same flight the next day. The next day the flight was delayed by 5 hrs, and then again by 1 hr.

"To begin with, our flight was cancelled and we didnt know about it until an hour and a half before the scheduled flight. The next flight was 7hours later and we were neither provided temporary lodging nor transportation back to the city.

We returned to the airport 5hours later only to find we had not been issued new tickets yet. It was mayhem, and even though we finally got on the flight, we missed our connection in Addis and ended up having to spend the night there. Which meant another nightmare of getting through lines at immigration and at the hotel assignment desk. I won't even comment on the hotel itself nor on the food provided - yes they were both that bad!
But suffice it to say, tje final slap in the face was finally getting to our destination a day late WITHOUT our luggage which meant extra time spent at the airport trying to sort that out.

"I only flew 2 times with Etiopian Airlines, but 2 times I had major problems.
The first time our flight from Brussels via Paris to Addis Ababa was cancelled. Ethiopian Airlines decided to skip Brussels and left all the passengers to fend for themselves, without prior notice, without explanation and without any help. We were stranded with some 200 passengers and had to look for another flight ourselves. Eventually we arrived more than 25 hours later at our destination. Of course we sued them and got our money back, but it is no fun nevertheless…
The second time we took a national flight from Makala in Ethiopia to Addis Ababa. While all our tickets were booked, payed, confirmed and even reconfirmed, Ethiopian Airlines did not want to check us in, claiming that we had not paid for our ticket. We showed proof of payment and all other documents, but to no avail. We were forced to buy new tickets to the capital (another 340EUR) so we could board the plane.
Unfortunately when we wanted to check in for our connecting flight, Ethiopian Airlines refused again to check us in, this time claiming that we did not take our first national flight, and thus they cancelled all connecting flights. We explained what happened in Makala and showed our newly paid boarding cards as proof that we did take the flight, but again to no avail…
So, while Ethiopian is supposedly the best airline in Africa (imagine the other African airlines…), it is probably the worst airline in the world. They have a very messy administration, their booking system is more like Swiss cheese, their payment system sucks,… Such a bad experience never again!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ku_en_Ma,Ku_en_Ma wrote a review Dec 2018,Ku_en_Ma,"Brussels, Belgium",66 contributions,34 helpful votes,Brussels - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r640678191-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Probably the worst airline in the world,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was shocking how this airline deliberately plans its connections for passengers to miss their onward flights. Our flight from Johannesburg departed an hour late. We only had a connection gap of 45 min at Addis Ababa even if the flight departed on time. We noticed that all of their onward connections had a similar gap or less. Our return flight had a connection gap of just 15 min. Naturally we missed our connecting flight from AA to Bahrain. Addis Ababa is the most disorganized and chaotic airport I have ever been to in all of my travels and I travel a lot. None of the airport staff were even willing to give us directions to gates. And those that gave us directions mislead us. After struggling for over an hour with our 2 year old child, we made it to the counter that deals with lay over passengers. The queue at the counter was so long. People were shouting and screaming at the way they were being treated. Everyone going everywhere was stranded at this airport. And the locals I spoke to tell me that this airline thrives on chaos and is an everyday affair. We joined the queue at 7pm and eventually fought our way (as was the norm) to the front of the counter at 09:20pm. They collected our passports and promised to put us on the Gulf Air flight that was scheduled to depart at 05am the next morning. They collected our passports and gave us meal vouchers after repeatedly asking the lady at the counter. They sent us to a lounge which looked like a run down cafeteria. The food was the worst. Rice and a veg curry. We bought biscuits and sat up the whole night waiting for our Gulf Air flight. At 2am I decided to check on the situation. Once again I had to fight my way through the queues. When I got to the front (embrace yourselves) they lost our passports. Yes they actually did. At 4am they managed to trace it back. We rushed from pillar to post carrying our 2 year old and all of our luggage as we were once again mislead when asked for departure gates. We eventually got to the gate and were waiting to board. As the flight pulls up on the run way they tell us that they cannot accommodate us on that flight due to lack of seats. Frustrated and exhausted after spending nearly 13 hours at this horrible airport, we accepted hotel accommodation. We told them that we would need our checked in luggage as our next flight out to Bahrain was only 2 days later and we didn't even have enough clothes on us. The lady said that they did not have a luggage tracking system and that she would have to take our luggage tag and physically search for our bags among a pile of thousand other bags and that would take at least 2 hours or more. We decided to abandon our luggage since we were beyond exhausted and we just wanted to get a room and shower and get some food for our child. It's 5am and we step out of the airport where we were promised that our shuttle to the hotel would be waiting. It was pitch dark and there was nobody in sight. We walked down the road only to be surrounded by groups of strange men who's intentions we weren't sure of. Luckily a taxi driver came by as a good Samaritan and offered to call the hotel for us from his phone. The shuttle arrived half an hour later and took us to what looked like a prison way out of the city. After arriving at the hotel and unpacking I decided to walk to the nearest supermarket. A cab driver offered to drive me there for 150 Birr. When we reached the supermarket he said it was 150 USD and not Birr. I decided to pay him the USD 150 as I didn't want trouble and walked back to the hotel. It doesn't end here. The challenges we had on our way back was a whole different ordeal on its own and the space here doesn't allow me to elaborate on those.

Generally my airline of choice for years now and it gives me smiles when they put their latest Dreamliners on their African routes . The cabin crew is very accessible and polite .my worry is the high cost of ticket prices in Cameroon on Ethiopian compared to other competitors in the industry. Well I generally recommend Ethiopian to many people and most often then call me to show their appreciation for the referral. They should improve on their entertainment content though and maybe I'm a little tired of eating that same food every time I travel Ethiopian.

"I was transiting at Addis Abba, their major airport for Ethiopian Airlines.  My original next flight was scheduled to be on board by 23:10 printed on my boarding pass that I got when I checked in at the 1st airport.  However, the screen shows 23:55 when I arrived to Addis Abba.  I had about three hours, so I decided to go somewhere else and come back by 23:10.  When I came back, the bus was about to leave from the gate, so I asked the lady behind the counter ""Is this for a flight to Hong Kong (my next destination)"".  She said ""No.  A flight to Hong Kong is already gone"".  I pointed out the screen right behind her showing ""23:55 Hong Kong/Manila"".  She said ""This information is wrong.  You have to go back to the customer service counter and buy another ticket"".  I stood there for disbelieve.  A second later, a young man from the bus came to me and said ""This bus is for a flight to Hong Kong.  Harry up and get on!"".  So, I got on and caught a right flight.  What was she thinking?

"Check-in could have been a disaster due to staff inexperience. The girl wanted us to disembark our luggage at Sao Paulo despite our through ticket to Asuncion. This would have cause us a lot of trouble with baggage allowances and convincing LATAM that we wer through passengers. Our vehement objections to this process caused her to seek experienced advice, and we got our through tickets after wasting 40 minutes, which meant that we could not browse duty-free, but had to run the length of Suvarnabhumi to catch our flight.
The next part isn't the airline's fault, but it's something to consider if you are flying into Africa. Many passengers' personal hygiene isn't marvellous and we suffered 8 hours next to one such person who had already been on the plane since Hong Kong. He actually was a very nice personality, but the smell was awful and of course inescapable.
In-flight service was fine, and the flight was on time.
The next 12-hour leg was from Addis Ababa, and I'm sure you have heard about this airport from others. Suffice it to say that it's very, very, very basic. (No AC in African temperatures...) Passengers were not odorous, but of course any flight that totals 20 hours East to West is not a great experience. Again, good in-flight service and on time.
The LATAM leg left late, flew through turbulence, but was only 1 hour 40 mins. On arrival, one of our cases (brand-new, first flight) was broken. I can't pin that on Ethiopian, but they had it for the bulk of the flight....
We have the return flight still to do, and after that we will not be using this airline again, despite it's low cost (still over 3,000 pounds for the journey).

"Ethiopian showed up in a comparative search as the cheapest flight from Cape Town to Vienna, and also one of the fastest - though of course, with a change of planes in Addis,  not as fast an the non-stop Air Austria flight, which was considerably more expensive, It was, at any rate, quite a bit faster and also cheaper than the Emirates flight, which would have involved a huge detour. In addition, in an age when airlines are cutting corners and charging for almost every extra, Ethiopian offers a generous luggage allowance (two 23 kg bags) plus advance seat selection at no extra price. The seats are also more spacious than most, making for a a comfortable trip, even in economy. Check-in in Cape Town was, admittedly , a nightmare, largely because of the generous luggage allowance. There were whole families, each member of which had the whole luggage allowance, and not very many check-in clerks.  Boarding, though, was relatively quick and efficient. On-board had some disappointments: I had booked an Asian Vegetarian meal, but this never materialised, and when I enquired, it seemed that they had no vegetarian fare on board (this was on all four legs of my trip).    The stop-over in Addis was mercifully short: the airport is being refurbished, and things are rather chaotic, with no proper signposting or gate indicators: I was sent from one gate to the other three times, with no apparent information kiosk. Still, I assume this will be ironed out once the construction work is complete.  All in all, the airport was crowded and disorganised, though  on the return trip things were less frantic, possibly because we landed at  a different time of day.  Addis is, in spite of the present inconvenience, a well situated hub for flights from Africa to other continents, and the airline is in the process of building up an impressive selection of destinations.  I think it will be giving the established European airlines a run for their money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michiel06,Michiel06 wrote a review Dec 2018,Michiel06,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",2 contributions,,Cape Town Central - Vienna,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r640304957-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Very good value for money,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently had an opportunity to travel to Ethiopia on Ethiopian Airlines. The flight over from IAD to Addis Ababa was very nice, as it was on a new Boeing 787. The seats were comfortable enough for economy, and when the person in front reclined I didn't feel like they were iny face or lap.

The flight back was on a Boeing 777 ER and it was not as nice as the other flight. The entertainment system audio jack was in the arm of the chair, and was broken, which made the long flight less enjoyable. But I've had that happen on other airlines too. Just shows a poor design.

But, overall I would travel with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750carlg,Carl G wrote a review Dec 2018,Carl G,"Denver, Colorado",16 contributions,2 helpful votes,Denver - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r640208906-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Pretty good airline,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"When the flight was delayed due to blizzard in Chicago this airline held the connecting flights in Addis Abbaba and made sure everyone made it to their connections.
I would also rate the inflight service from the attendants better than most American Airlines. This airline is making its mark as best in Africa and I will give them a thumbs up on efforts.
On the return trip I upgraded the segment from Malawi to Addis Ababba to business class and I will have to say they set the bar pretty high. I have flown business in the US on both United and Delta of which neither come close to Ethiopian.
They offer menus for 3 course meals that are served in courses with white table cloths. They have 3 pages of wines to select from. Individual travel kits at each seat. Even in coach there is a packet with earbuds (that are too big to stay put in the normal ear canal) along with socks, eye masks and beautifully woven blankets.

"We travelled from Oslo via Addis to Windhoek on business class (4 flights in total).

We experienced an excellent service WAY beyond what we have had for many years.

I was a gold member in Air France/KLM for 15 years but I never had this level of service.
I also have levels on Lufthansa (socalled 5 star....) and SAS.

Ethiopian are classy.

We would especially like to emphasize the service of Ms. Kalkidan Kaki. She is definitely a good representative of Ethiopian Arilines, but the whole staff made an excellent job.

As written abowe we had 4 flights with Ethiopian, and all flights were very good experiences.

The only negative point is the airport in Addis, but Ethiopian Airlines cannot do much about this.
As a businesss class passenger you are unfortunately referred to a rather bad lounge, Overcrowded and no seats. This could be improved for the people paying the most.

"Hello Again,
Sometimes you leave good comments just because you were lucky to be served by a good person, this was my previous review.
Now, i had a situation where i missedmy flight due to Airport slow service and flight late on both arrival and evacuation.
They belamed me and didn't try to help me, imagine i have spent one full day with my travel agent trying to convince Ethiopian customer service to chane my route and we recommend 3 options but no use, the were very disappointing and not helpful at all.
They also refused to book me a hotel and pay for my visa,the team leader was not helpful.
Believe me I do like Ethiopians and i wish all success for Ethiopia, but this case made me take a decision not to fly with them again and i told one of the Managers there,
While i was waiting i met too many people complaining, apone of them told me that he had to fly with Ethiopian because it has more flights to Africa but he doesn't like it.
I don't think the customer service are professional enough, to fix my issue they booked me to the next flight after two days for my other two flights, imagine when i arrived with the first flight and found the other flight departed already, now in the airport here telling me i have to book another ticket for tomorrow and buy a visa and a hotel.

Total mess, this is not acceptable.
I am changing my route next time.

"I have never flown on this airline before but surprisingly it was a pleasant experience. The plane was very new and legroom comfortable except the aisles in between the rows of seats were a wee bit narrower than usual. Arms were to be kept in most times, otherwise the food trolleys couldn’t get through smoothly. The 9 hours+ flight was uneventful as it was a red-eye flight. Flight attendants were pleasant. Comfort could have been better if the used blankets could be removed before boarding of passengers in Singapore. The promotional package seems a good deal as we used this airline for our flight to and from Addis Ababa to Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv as well as homebound to Singapore.

Flight was 13 hours non-stop.  comfortable flight.  although there was some sort of passenger conflict with people sitting in someone else's seat and they had to bring back the pilot to tell them to knock it off.  but other than that it went well.easy entry to the airport on way home.  they have a business class lounge and it was fully stocked free WiFi. this flight originated at 11PM and i felt business class.  17 hours with an hour layover in Dublin.  it was all good.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/89/4f/b7/barry-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrycI6007MP,Barry C wrote a review Dec 2018,Barry C,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",177 contributions,70 helpful votes,Washington DC - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r638415028-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,trip to the urban age conference,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were in transit with a shortconnection time, but all went well - apart from boarding. We were amougst the first to board and take our seats, but as others boarded so many people ignored their assigned seats to sit wherever they liked, including moving from economy into business class. A complete free for all. After the crew accepted some people in the incorrect seating, redirecting passengers to ‘spare’ seats they lost control and boarding took ages. The person who wanted a window seat and so sat in business class was eventually relocated elsewhere in economy.

"Being a frequent flyer (I fly every week at least once), an aviation and travel markets enthusiast and having recently read so much in both technical and leisure news on Ethiopian Airlines recent achievements in the global market, i decided to give them a try and travel from Europe (Madrid) to Cape Town, via their hub in Ethiopia.

Had a flight booked for 3 pax for 28th November which had its schedule changed for the 30th - 2 days of delay!! - just the day before. The company did not notify any of the 3 passengers and we only realized it as we attempted to check in online some 12 hours before. We attempted to get in contact with their Call center many times. Each time we got in contact with an agent, always after waiting some very incredible 45 minutes minimum, if not one hour, we would have to explain that 2 days delays was unbearable and taht e would require alternative coonections, in line with our passenger rights. They would seek to force alternatives within Ethiopian network forcing us around Europe with added delay. when we would ask for an alternative within partner airlines, the agent would accept...but call would always coincidentilly, in that same period, fall. This happened four times in the exact same moment - that when we ask our minimum passenger rights -an alternative with other airlines. In my 4th and last attempt, I even asked the agent to write down my number and call me back if the call would fall. What, not surprisingly, happened again in the moment where I asked for alternative arrangements. Also, not surprisingly, no call back was received even if the agent guaranteed he would be doing it.

Having had this serious difficulty, we figured that the only way would be going to the airport at the hour and day we had in our purchased ticket. We were surprised to find no airline agent there and absolutely no one dealing with passengers found in this situation.

We again tried some times to reach the Call center and finally got, on our third attempt, a call through with an agent. And, yes, now surprisingly, the connection was not cut in that specific moment where we ask for alternative arrangements being stranded passangers at the airport as we were.

The agent was, nonetheless, somewhat surprised that we would request that since our flight had already been planned for 2 days ahead. Its as if the company does not understand the damage it imposes on its clients with 2 days of delay.

We were, notwithstanding and after some struggle, able to obtain an alternative connection with Turkish Airlines, Via Istambul, which made us arrive with 24 hours of delay.

Needless to say that no hotel arrangement was provided and the agents denied our right to the Eur 600 compensation, imposed by EU law. The agent said that - his words - since we were getting an alternative flight, we were not entitled to a ""refund"", failing to understand the difference between refund and compensation under EU law's obligations of support for stranded passangers.

Now in Cape Town, we were, sadly and once again, surprised with a change in our flights back, although this time the company did notify us with 4 days in advance. They decided, out of the blue, to insert a stop in our flight to Madrid in Rome, resulting in a 3hour delay. This wouldn't be that relevant if it wouldn't represent as it does a loss of a indenpendent connection which we had arranged for some comfortable 3 hours after our initial scheduled arrival to Madrid

Aware of our rights in cases of schedule changes, I once again attempted to contact the company. I explained them our situation and the agent told us that, since we had already obtained our change initially on our flight to Cape town, changing flight in our journey out of Cape Town would represent a cost to us. We struggled to even show the agent that a) we did not want to change our initial flights, we were forced due to a delay of 2 days and b) again, we are not chaniging our flights back because we want but rather because they decided us to fly us to Rome, something that was not in the ticket we bought, resulting in a very relevant schedule change and delay.

The agent understood after some debate and finally he prepared to arrange us alternative connections in alternative airlines. When the connection was cut.

We tried a second time, going through the same matter and issue. Guess what? That strange coincidence that the connection falls eactly in the same moment of conversation - when we ask for alternative flights.

Honestly, we've given up. We represent that this company will not give us our compensations - as per EU law -, will not reimburse us of our hotel in Madrid which we were forced to pay since the flight was postponned 2 days and will not assume the legal responsability of obtaining us alternative flight when the delay they change their flights to something different of our purchased tickets.

I have never been this disappointed with an airline and Im yet to board them for the first time. I fly an average of 80 to 90 flights a year, from the cheapest available Ryanair flight to First Class of Emirates. I have faced all kinds of difficulties in travelling and, better or worse, all companies have established procedures for assistance to stranded passengers.

I have travelled more than 100 airlines and, believe it or not, I am not a very demanding passanger. I do represent the operational difficulties and how the industry works, and I do antecipate that problems may happen.

Nonetheless, I never felt complete disdain for a client in ANY carrier as I now feel with Ethiopian Airlines. And yes, for those frequent fliers reading my report, yes, they are even worse than the likes of Ryanair in what comes to client care assistance.

So, Im really sorry to say this, but if you can, avoid them.

"Never fly ethiopia airlines as a lone female. I got physically held (one gripping each arm) at security by two women while a third undid my trousers and put her hands in my pants. When I screamed they all laughed and sent me back through the scanner so that they could repeat the exercise, this time groping inside my bra. I am ashamed to say I cried at which point they refused to let me into the departure lounge. Luckily a fellow traveller dragged me through. Needless to say I didn’t sleep on the flight despite it departing at 1.20am.

"I was really disappointed with this service. There was only one girl on business class check in at Cape Town and it took 45 minutes to get 12 business class passengers checked in - with understandable frustration all round.
There was then no organisation for boarding the plane, everyone pushed in together.
The plane was a dream-liner, very clean, comfortable and a very pleasant flight, but i must say that the food was very poor in quality. I don't know if it was prepared in South Africa or Ethiopia, but the quality was extremely poor, cold coffee served, and while the staff were of course as pleasant as always I'm afraid for the price paid for the ticket, i could not say it was value for money, i travelled previously to LA with Ethiopian and had a very different experience...

If I had taken the new flight, I would have missed my entire stay in Dublin, a concert I paid $450 for, and my flight from Dublin to Madrid, not to mention the hotel I would still have to pay for due to their cancellation policy. Ethiopian just shrugged their shoulders and told me ""that's when the flight is now."" I had to jump through hoops just to get my refund, and I was told I would receive no additional compensation. My new flight on Aer Lingus was nearly double what I paid on Ethiopian BECAUSE IT WAS 6 DAYS BEFORE I INTENDED TO FLY. You just can't book an international flight 6 days out.

"It was my first ever flight with Ethiopian Airlines but not with Star Alliance ... I used to have the best possible treatment even in Economy class with All Nippon, Asiana, Air Cana etc. but it was a real sour disappointment with EA. First headache start already with a booking process online. The system glitch has caused a wrong date confirmation for my whole Family (5PAX) and a date changes cost(which call center agent acknowledge that it is due to a system error though she charged me.)
We have taken a flight from Addis - Arba Minch - Addis. We have decided to shorten our stay in Arba Minch and fly to Addis Ababa earlier. Gave a call a to a call center and spoke with a very polite agent who advised me that we can change our flight with only 800Bir in total for 5 of us and NO other charges. With a confidence that less than 30$ will board us on the flight took us to Arba Minch Airport. It was a disaster ... They have only 1 arrogant staff who refuses to do anything until you pay money. (i heard a lot about an African bureaucracy). After 1 hr useless conversation with an Agent who tried to convince me that ``Unlimited Free Changes`` ticket gives you a right to change dates as much as you can but you will need to pay the ticket price difference :)))) i pretended that he was right and paid 2400Birr to be allowed on the plain with Flexible tariff ticket :). Since all the domestic flight are operated by one Monopoly and no other options (only by taxi or bus) available ... i really doubt the service quality will ever change.
Have a safe flight :)))",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/bf/f7/98/dilnur-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729dilnura,Dilnur A wrote a review Nov 2018,Dilnur A,"Tórshavn, Faroe Islands",201 contributions,92 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Arba Minch,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r635953076-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Star Alliance standard?!,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was our third trip on Ethiopian Airlines, and it will be our last.  Each time was worse than the preceding one.  We were supposed to have about three hours between flights in Addis Ababa, but the airline changed their schedules so that we had only 65 minutes.  This made me nervous, and justifiably so, because we left Dulles an hour late.  We were never given an explanation for the delay.  We made up no time in the air and arrived in Addis just about when boarding for our flight to Entebbe was supposed to be closing.  The airline did something right for a change - they pulled out passengers with connections to Entebbe and Nairobi and put them on busses to take them directly to their flights.  But right with this airline is relative, because when we got our plane, the flight was delayed for two hours, so back to the terminal we went.  When we finally  boarded, it wasn't by rows or sections, it was just a huge crush.  We got breakfasts on both flights, and the scrambled eggs were cold both times.On the return flight, we got to Addis only a little late, but getting on to our flight was a horror, because all flights to the US leave from one end of the terminal, and you have to go through security even though you have already gone through security.  There is only one line for all the passengers on a Boeing 777, which is a lot of passengers, so by the time we finally got through, boarding was already well along.  The flight stopped in Dublin, for some reason (nobody got on or off), and between Dublin and Dulles we got a meal which should have been breakfast, but was more like lunch or dinner.  Chicken and rice is not my idea of breakfast, but at least it wasn't cold.Service is spotty at best.  Nobody cleans up the restrooms, and when they run out of toilet paper the flight attendants rarely put in new paper even if you tell them about it.We are going to Namibia in a couple of months.  Ethiopian was an option for getting there.  We are flying South African.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanB140,Alan B wrote a review Nov 2018,Alan B,"Duluth, Georgia",129 contributions,51 helpful votes,Washington DC - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r635627511-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Never Again,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight from Addis to Dubai was canceled because the connection plane(Ethiopian flight) from Yaunde Was too late so by the time we were in Addis we were told to wait and wait and wait.
Nobody knows what is going on, obviously the flight is delayed by more than nine hours and they are treating customers like refugees, wanting them to sleep on the floor where the airline doesn’t even provide hotel, even worse, they don’t even have a lounge.

I really don’t understand, some of us are going for business or holidays and we have planned our stays and business conferences and paid for our hotel in Dubai, hoping this airline will get us there on time.
And if the airline can’t do their job properly, they should say so.

We couldn’t talk to anyone or get a proper response from anybody, all they can only say is ‘be patience

This is so disappointing and I will never recommend this airline to anyone. Not a pleasant place to be stuck for hours

"This flight leaves late in the evening from Addis and arrives around 9:00 the following morning in Dulles.  The flight stops in Dublin to refuel and change crews.  Both crews were friendly, but not exceptionally so.  My Asian veg meal was available, but I had to ask for it (they were unaware I had ordered it until I told them).  After I ate it, I wished I had not reminded them.  Seats are uncomfortable.  In flight entertainment is poor - my touch screen monitor was hard to operate and my neighbor's did not work at all.  Even them, the movie selections are wanting. The main problem with this flight (and the airline in general) is that the check-in staff do not enforce carry-on luggage restrictions.  People bring baggage that is way too big (or they bring several medium size bags) and if you are not in zone 1 or 2, you will have a hard time finding overhead compartment space because people in those zones rush in to cram their bags, which means a person seated in row 12 may have to look for overhead space in row 15 or 16.  This lethargy of check-in staff delays the boarding process and diminishes the flight's overall experience and the airline's professionalism / image.  After my last 4 flights on ET, I will look for alternatives, such as KQ.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/2f/7d/0e/matt-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/576MattP,Matt P wrote a review Nov 2018,Matt P,"Lutherville, Maryland",237 contributions,72 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r635051524-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,ET 500 from Lilongwe to Dulles via Dublin,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew business class with Ethiopian Airlines, but the service and experience was the worst ever.

The first leg of our trip (Cape Town to Ethiopia) was an older plane which was falling apart, but the worst was when we arrived at the airport in Addis Ababa. Possibly the worst airport in the world. Disorganized and the toilets are very dirty.

The second leg of our trip was with a newer plane, but when we arrived in Barcelona one of our bags was badly damaged and the other one was missing. We have contacted the airlines several times at our own cost with little support from them and only 4 days later we received the lost bag, but it was also damaged.

They cancelled the route to Barcelona and forced us to take an earlier flight to Frankfurt, or we had to pay our own cost to Madrid.

After several letters and more than 4 months, we have not received any cost for the damaged baggage.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ISIKHALA,Peter wrote a review Nov 2018,Peter,"Plattekloof, South Africa",6 contributions,2 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Barcelona,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r634464745-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,VERY DISAPPOINTING,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The beginning of the flight in Accra was ok, with boarding colour-coded and relatively organised. The food was ok as was the service though I would have thought that staff could have brought round more drinks. The flight arrived in Addis on time.

Then those of us in transit were in queues waiting to be accommodated overnight for more than three hours! Eventually a supervisor reported that there were no rooms available as the hotels had given them out due a big Africa Union meeting.

"We went on this flight through Addis because of the good price. The airline was as good as can be expected. A big plus was the legroom. So important on a long journey. Check in was helpful both there and return and as I have a stiff leg I was given an isle seat. Unfortunately being right at the back I was constantly woken by either people using the toilet or staff cleaning it.The flights themselves were smooth and uneventful
On the downside the food was at best boring and the drinks options were poor. No spirits and awful beer. I have yet to try a wine on a plane that was drinkable. This was no exception.

"Having only travelled in the past with Emirates Airlines on my first international trip, there is not much to compare when it comes to travelling abroad as many of my counterparts on this site. However I can attest to being impressed with this airline and as it goes without saying... ""First Impressions Last "" Ethiopian Airlines comes across as a well structured airline with friendly staff and quality travelling. Good legroom, and seating. My only negative would be that the on flight entertainment could have used a better variety of movies especially for those who struggle to sleep (like me) during a flight. Still I am fortunate enough to be an avid reader so I had back up entertainment... Addis Ababa (Bole) International although under new construction was easy to navigate for those who are transferring to different destinations. In all a good travelling experience at a great price I would definitely consider using Ethiopian Airlines for my next trip!

"It was the first time using this airline, I was attracted by the price but boy did I regret it!!!  At check-in in Durban I discovered they had given my seats away & were given seats away from each other.  On arrival in Addis I had to fight to get our seats back so we could sit together as a family.  On our return our bags were left in Addis that was not the problem it happens but when the mistake has been made it’s how you fix it.  Ethiopian Airlines could not be bothered.

"The departure from Addis was chaotic - the gate (#9) was in a new portion of the airport that maybe isn't really ready to handle customers.  Very few Departure / Arrival display screens and there are no vendors.  Acoustics are poor when they announce flights.    The flight was on a 737 and it lasted about 4 hours.

"I have made several attempts to contact Ethiopian Airlines regarding my horrible experience in Senegal regarding my luggage arrival. I arrived on 13 August in Dakar, after suffering a major delay in Entebbe for 2 hours, then another 3 hour delay occurred in Addis, causing us to arrive 2 hours later than planned in Dakar. Upon arrival my suitcase didn’t arrive after waiting for 2 hours. My destination for my trip was to Touba for two weeks to see my family (please see the attached ticket), which is 3 hours away from the airport. I requested for the suitcase (when it arrived at the airport) to be delivered to my house, in response: Ethiopian Airlines does not provide that type of service. I was forced to take a hotel reservation in Dakar (the cheapest hotel I could find online) and only able to get a good deal if I paid for 5 days. In order to travel to and from the hotel, I had to pay for shuttle service.

I used the tracking number on the baggage claim form to locate my suitcase for three days. I called Ethiopian airlines multiple times, still no feedback regarding the location of my suitcase. On the early morning of day 4, I took a risk/gamble and begged the receptionist of the hotel to arrange shuttle service to the airport. Fortunately enough, my suitcase was there. Though I was happy, a feeling of disgust overcame me due to the complete disregard Ethiopian Airlines had for my well-being and privacy. I was never notified when the suitcase arrived, and I was informed the suitcase was there for almost 2 days. Upon retrieving the suitcase I contacted the airlines again with my case number (just to see if my pick-up was in the system) the response was the suitcase has not been found yet, I will be notified.

I’ve been using Ethiopian Airlines since, September 2017 (sheba miles# 000985527575) and never experienced this behaviour from any airline before. It was a sickening and stressful inconvenience for me since my time is Senegal was very limited. I returned to my duty station of work in Juba, South Sudan and contacted the office, in turn they referred me to the Senegal Office. There has been a lot of back and forth in calling. Due to my health condition and work, I was unable to visit the offices.

I will like for Ethiopian airlines to address this issue after seeing the expenses incurred during this trip due to it’s negligence. If it appears the airlines is not willing to admit to their fault, I will like to seek consult from legal and the corporate office on how to move forward. Honestly, I’m very reluctant to use this service to travel to West Africa again, let alone to New York.

"This is my second time flying with this airline and I must say they have improved quite a bit. The service is excellent but unfortunately they still have to work on their selection of dining. Many of the options are very spicy or super chewy and/or hard (the meat).

My flight from Dubai to Ethiopia was on a brand new Cloud Nine aircraft, the Business class section was super nice. Very comfortable seating with tons of room. The second leg of my trip (Ethiopia to Toronto) was an older plane which was falling apart, fabric coming off of the seats and not the standard I am used to in Business class. Although there was a larger food menu with the option to try Ethiopian delicacies.

I love the little amenity kit they give and the array of snacks and beverages available throughout the flight was very good. Ultimately they want to keep you happy but I think they still have a little work to do.

Addis Ababa Airport - Ugh!!
This airport has not changed at all. They still allow people to smoke and it is too small for the amount of passengers moving through there. They opened a new Cloud Nine Business Lounge, but good luck getting a seat as it is fully packed. I wasn’t overly happy with the food choices or beverages (a small cart with juices and pop).

"Starting with positive: new planes, safety seems important to the company and it felt so as well. In-flight service was very good, fast (usually), entertainment options were very good. Check-in in Paris and in Maputo at return were smooth and very good.

Now to negative, quite some problems:
- Agents in airports were totally useless, it took a while to get any information and get things done. First time in my life I was downgraded (still waiting for compensation).
- Only one service desk in their hub, Addis Ababa Bole Airport is not normal.
- Awareness of staff, nobody really knows anything about the flights or services the company provides or should provide. HQ call center has no ideas when and if their flights depart or what is the actual situation. Nobody dares to take the responsibility or show initiative. Seems the ground operations are built up inconsistently and sometimes people make up rules as they go. Very bad management and use of resources.
- In Maputo Star Gold Members have limited access to lounge. Staff somehow doesn't know or just doesn't tell customers they could use SAA lounge that works in accordance to Star Alliance rules still.
- Star Alliance Gold Lounge in Addis Ababa airport should be closed down, it's crime against travellers. It's more painful to be there than other public areas. Ethiopian Airlines really discriminates.

In short - once you make on board it's ok, everything before and after that can be an absolute nightmare.

"During my whole experience with ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES I was mistreated, lied to, not enough compensated, flight cost was 800 EUR, and they acted like the most horrible low cost airline, showing no respect/costumer service and inefficiency

This is the story of how Ethiopian Airlines (mis)treats its costumers, Saturday night (November 3, 2018) I had a flight going from Addis Ababa to Paris...guy on the counter told me there was a “change in aircraft” & issued me a “standby ticket” but told me there was nothing wrong & seat would be assigned at gate.

My baggage was checked, I then proceeded to do security, and asked two more #ethiopianairlines people, told me there was “nothing wrong”, I did the line, waited to hop on the plane, me together w/other 5 were on standby, I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO LET THE AGENT KNOW I WAS WAITING TO BE SEAT-ASSIGNED.

They told me the flight was full, if there was any seat they’d give it to ME...they didn’t, instead, they gave it to the other guys that arrived later. I stayed there shocked, and waited & waited, they told me they were going to put me on plane to another city in Europe and then connect me to PARIS...they EVEN ISSUED A TICKET for me to go to Geneva, kept me on hold, BUT NEVER LET ME ON ANY PLANE, so after one very stressful hour, took me to the office so they’d re-issue a ticket for the next flight (which was in 24 hours) and give me an economic compensation at this point, information was never clear and all agents seemed unprepared, all agents were rude and un-helpful, and they kept running “away” without giving me answers.

I arrived to the office....to find out my “compensation” was 200 dollars....for a mistake THEY did agent again acted rude. They issued me a BOARDING PASS with an ASSIGNED SEAT for the FOLLOWING DAY (24 hours wait in the city, with the miserable 200 dollars), and gave me a paper to “cash in” the money in “ANY ticket office of ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES” literal words from the agent.

Next day....I came to the Airport, to cash in my money.....surprise, they “couldn’t cash money at airport” “they didn’t have dollars” “supervisor couldnt sign the release paper” were some of the various excuses they gave me. They told me to pick up the MONEY at the HILTON HOTEL in the city...30 min drive from the airport...I arrived at the hotel, and guess what? They DIDN’T HAVE DOLLARS, so....they told me they were going to “try to get the money”

Told me to give them my number and they will call me with a “solution”....I went away, and at 3:50pm they called me to tell me they had the money, that I had until 5pm to get there (another 30-40 minute drive) and get it...rudeness again was present

They told me I couldn’t get it at the airport, since no supervisor was available to give me the money, going to the hotel was MANDATORY. I picked up the ridiculous 200USD, since I rather die before letting them keeping 1 more cent from me, and thought this was the final chapter of this bad Ethiopian movie

IT WASN’T, THINGS WERE ONLY GONNA GET WORSE.

I get on the plane the NEXT day at 11:30 pm Sunday (after spending one WHOLE day in Addis) battling with Ethiopian Airlines, get on the plane, get seated on my seat...and GUESS WHAT?? ANOTHER woman with a baby and I had he SAME seats assigned...and a VERY RUDE Ethiopian Airlines agent demanded I moved, since the woman had also this seat..I HAD PREVIOUSLY CONFIRMED BY PHONE AND IN PERSON WITH ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES previous to boarding to MAKE SURE they didn’t make another mistake.

I demanded be moved ONLY to another HALL SEAT, and he and the stewardesses kept pushing me to move without telling me where to go, I said no several times…..the super-rude agent comes comes telling me he has “found” a hall-seat by moving another woman to Frist Class…..turns out, no upgrade for the nice lady, I had 2 seat in the MIDDLE ... he left, no explanation, stewardesses didn’t know a/thing or gave answers, rude treatment again.

I tried to get explanations from the crew members, which throughout the whole experience only shown incompetence and rudeness, obviously couldn’t get any explanation or (at the very least) apologies

Agents of all sorts behaved so rudely, they all gave me different information, and evidently all wrong information,

I was not the only one in this situation, there were more people with me on this “journey”, so is not an isolated episode of this TERRIBLE airline

"First leg of the flight from Paris to Addis was ok, older airline, not so comfortable.
The vegetarian meal was very bland. The cabin crew didn't seem too enthused about their job, not expecting them to jump up and down, but it is a service job! I shouldn't be made to feel bad to ask for extra water.

The 2nd leg from Addis to Vic Falls in Zim was much better, newer airline, nicer cabin crew. We saw all the luggage on the apron in Addis and knew one of our pieces wouldn't arrive,it was chaos, murphys law, it didn't arrive.

SAM at the ZIM Vic falls office was SUPER! he went as far as giving us his WhatsApp number to stay in touch re the bag, he got the bag onto another flight and into the Zambian airport at the vic falls where we were based, a HUGE thank you to Sam, he really made us feel confident in finding my bag.

"I wasn't expecting this kinda experience as they call this airline is best in Africa, I have serious doubt over it. I wasn't served the vegeterian food which was already booked while booking and the reason was that they don't have or it is over. Such a terrible answer and the reply of the cabin crew was, let me see and I will get back to you, which never happened.

Despite pressing the call button for 20 mins, noone came and I had to get up from my seat and disturb other passengers to reach to them and ask for the food.

And what I got was worst and I was told to have it in the area where crew manage things as others passengers may ask for the vegetarian food too..

"I travelled extensively during the last 1.5 years both internationally and on domestic flights with Ethiopian Airlines. They offer a real good service in both 'Bole'-terminals 1 and 2 and it must become even better once the international terminal is inaugurated, hopefully by the end of this year. Also the service during the flights is, in comparison with many other airlines, to be considered very good, no complain. However, the often times cumbersome security checks in both 'Bole'-terminals, twice in each location (ground- and upper floor), may be a bit of a minus, thus, I always check-in early to avoid queueing and time pressure.

I flew with Ethiopian Airlines in August when I left the US to go visit my family. Little did I know the nightmare that was waiting for me when I left my home. Ethiopian Airlines canceled my flight 3 times. Why you ask?  because of safety concerns according to them. Now my question for them is why do you allow a flight ticket to be bought 3xxx not once but 3xxx if there are safety concerns??? I booked it they canceled and then whenever they canceled they would give me a ticket that was 2 days out like something would change in 3 days. I had to stay in ADDIS for a week and a half because these people couldn't get their ducks in a row. My phone was stolen and ran out of money due to staying at hotel that they refused to  ACCOMMODATE ME FOR. MY ADVICE DON'T TAKE THEM. TAKE ANOTHER AIRLINE.

"Let me start off by saying I have emailed them several times about my experience and they all respond once and then ignore my emails. I have been waiting for a response for 2 months as of now. Even their Twitter account started to ignore me. Very sketchy airline.

Food gave the entire family food poisoning. The meat was bad.

The AC was completely off, everyone on the plane was boiling and requested AC be turned on multiple times but nothing was done.

They had no TVs on any of their international flights - yet their prices were more expensive then other airlines that DO have on flight entertainment.

Cleaning crew stole my phone and when proven (using Find My iPhone) the customer service team told me to email them about it another day and then ""wrote a claim"" up for me on the back of a random paper which I am suppose to believe went to management....

I have emailed them once a week since end of August. It is not end of October and I have only gotten 2 responses and no one has assisted me further.

I travel internationally twice a month and hardly ever have any trouble with any airline but Ethiopian Airlines has been nothing but a nightmare to work with.

I hope I can change at least one persons mind about flying with them because this airline honestly deserves to be shut down. Very dirty aircraft, food is not only horrible but harmful, customer service is terrible and their flight cleaning crew cannot be trusted.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND FLYING WITH ANY AIRLINE BUT ETHIOPIAN.

"Well done Ethiopian! Myself, my partner and two children flew Dub-LAX return and we were delighted. I am tall so benefitted from the extra space in row 11. Good choice of movies. Loved the examples of Ethiopian music available also - a great introduction.

Food was typical airline fare, nothing really stood out but it was entirely edible and tasty. Our teens are fussy eaters though and didnt like the food, but we anticipated this and we had brought plenty of carry-on snacks with us from the airport. The Ethiopian coffee was superb, best I have ever had on a flight.

The cabin crew were efficient and friendly, their smiles were infectious! They have to work so hard though!

One of the best things about this flight was its early morning departure which meant that we were in LAX at 10.30am. The return flight to Dublin was great also, as it departed at midnight, allowing you to sleep most of the night.

For the price we paid for effectively four adult fares, we were blown away by the value for money we got - given the low fares, we would have been happy with Ryanair-level service, but what we got was something approaching (but not quite up to) the Aer Lingus standard.

The only negative I can think of was that on the outbound flight, the pull-up tv screen in row 11 was very dirty and sticky, while on the return journey, the screen in the same row was not working at all, and there were no alternative seats available - luckily I wanted to sleep during the flight!

"While I must say the flight personnel , ie the flight attendants and the pilots were excellent, so polite and solicitous, the ground staff was horrendous. Our luggage was delayed for five days. We arrived in Victoria Falls with the clothes on our backs from Boston. No luggage. We talked it’s the Customer Service Representative, Samuel Kuyaya on the ground in Victoria Falls. While polite, he has been useless, deceptive and has stonewalled us from September 6. Our claim, which we filed on September 6 is still not resolved, holding up not only compensation from Ethiopian Airlines  but also our Travel Insurance and our credit card. The excuses have been endless and truly appear to be a blatant attempt to frustrate passengers to the point that they just give up.  I will not give up. But warn others to do whatever to avoid using Ethiopian Airlines for the terrible service on the ground. You never know when you will lose your luggage and you can’t trust or count on them.

"Ethiopian offer a flight from Zanzibar to Cairo via Addis Ababa. What they don't mention when they take your money is there isn't time to make the connection in Addis Ababa for the next flight.

Now, I admit, that when I saw 20 minutes on the schedule fin Addis, I assumed the plane touched down and people got off/on. I didn't think they expected me to get off the plane, onto a bus to the terminal, get through security and board my next flight in 20 minutes. Clearly this is impossible!

Having missed my connection, they offered to put me on the same flight 24 hours later, which I declined. Only by standing for nearly three hours at the overwhelmed Transfers desk, appealing to three different people (the first two said there was no alternative) I was given a seat on an Air Egypt flight 6 hours later.

I don't know how they get away with this kind of misselling?!

"Am very disappointed n disgusted by the customer service, from the airport to the ethiopian airlines offices staff!!! I checked in online and as usual, I was there one hour prior to departure . The staff were so slow while others talking on the phone. The lady at the counter killed my time by telling me to go n separate my baggage, upon coming back she tells me that I haven't checked in yet n that I should go to the office at the back of the counter. When I went there the lady I found was so rude n did not take any minute to acknowledge that a customer was there. She kept me waiting for her n without a word, she pointed to the direction of one gentleman, who was to assist me n yet did not as he is the one I gave the screen shots of my check in. He goes n tells the other that she checked in already. But the lady literary refuses that I can't go. So the guy to be kind he tells me that I can fly, but not with my laggage. What is the essence of checking in online? After all this situation he tells me that it's 10 minutes to the departure so I can't go. What kind of service is this?
The most annoying part was I asked to talk to the supervisor or manager, I was told that they are on the flight n its closed thus they can't attend to me!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disgust!!!!!!!!!
N the only option I have is to pay 200 dollars n take the next flight. Why should I do That?
I went to the office hopping to get some help, but still I was told that at the time of the incident there were only 2 staff on ground..... Of which that should not be my business. After I narrated my nasty experience to the gentleman I found in the office, he tells me that I can't get help from there as the supervisor n managers are always busy n can refuse to see the customer, as they have so many meetings to attend n they can't call them for such complaints. He chased us n told us to sit aside he wants to attend to other customers. What kind of service is this? And at the time of the incident I was told that there were only two staff on ground so no one would attend to me.....",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893agapel,Agape L wrote a review Oct 2018,Agape L,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - Bahrain,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r626471551-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Pathetic and disgusted!!!!!!!!!,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fly Ethiopian Airlines and start your trip with a bad experience.
Very quickly you realize that the cheap airfare is not worth the aggravation on flight and at Addis.
The airplanes were modern, and clean. But the experience of dealing with the airplane staff and connection at Addis were just too difficult.
An Ethiopian male passenger started to be offensive, and physically assaulted another female passenger. The airplane should have been diverted to the nearest airport and this passenger should have been removed from the flight. But it was not done and the flight crew just tried to calm the individual.
The airport at Addis does not have the capacity to handle large number of passengers in-transit. The people working at the hub are not properly trained, do not seem to understand English, and seem to be scared as if someone was watching them. They always seemed to answer a question with a ""reply question"", but never a simple answer. The airport does not have sufficient choice of restaurants, shopping, etc. Just trying to make a telephone call was difficult, as the payphones didn't work.
The connection flights from Addis did not exist. It appears it was a just a trick to get people to book flights via Addis, by getting travellers misled into believing there was onward flights to final destinations with a short stop in Addis.
Maybe it's the only way the country gets some travellers to stop in Addis Abba.
Very bad experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/1a/3e/6c/kaugx.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaugz,Kaug Toyo wrote a review Oct 2018,Kaug Toyo,"Bodo, Norway",27 contributions,16 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r626254215-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Bad experience on flight and at Addis connection.,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The flights took off more or less on time and we were looked after really well.

"It's all well and good having a booking and getting on your Ethiopian flight to later l arrive at your destination. However, when you have ISSUES with your Ethiopian booking that's when a different story altogether.
I was told (after I had emailed customer services regarding my seats) that there was a problem with my booking and my ticket was not valid for travel. Hmm, funny that I distinctly remembered a debit of over 1000 euro from my account with the description ""Ethiopian Airlines"" and perhaps a few numbers and letters thrown in.
To make a long story short, I rang customer services 8 times over the course of a week to find out what was going on with my ticket, which was clearly paid for looking at my bank statement. After almost two weeks of fixing a ridiculous mistake on their part, they told me my ticket was finally valid for travel on a Friday - I was travelling that Monday and their phone lines close at the weekend.

I still wonder:
A) When were they going to tell me my ticket wasn't valid. They happened to mention it when I emailed them about something else.
B) Why their customer service was appalling. I was constantly told someone would ring me back - that never happened, I had to keep ringing to find out what was going on with my ticket.
C) Why I didn't get much of an apology or explanation as to what happened.

Endured almost two weeks of stress waiting to find out that my ticket was actually valid for travel. 1000 euro is a lot of money - yes mistakes can be made but one should at least be entitled to decent customer service after paying out that much money for a big, well-known airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/a5/ac/03/lisamarie357.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamarieg365,lisa365 wrote a review Oct 2018,lisa365,"London, United Kingdom",5 contributions,2 helpful votes,Dublin - Lusaka,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r625786861-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,AWFUL customer service,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A great airline, with new planes and great service on board. It is a pleasure flying with them.

The lounge in Addis is somewhat simple and does not really reflect standards of other Star Alliance airlines, including South African Airways in Africa. Good news is that the airport is very efficient and fast, particularly for business class travelers with Gold status.

Good news is too that the airport expansion should be over soon.

"Having the luxury of a designated bus for business passengers to be taken to the airport terminal was working this time for me against me. We were dropped of at terminal 2 and my connecting flight to Muscat was leaving from Terminal 1 - this mean I had to walk against the flow of passengers. The economy class passenger were dropped of at terminal 1 - that logic my dear friends at Ethiopian I don't understand.
Terminal 1 is one of those old terminals in Africa of the 1980 the business class lounge is, well nothing to write about but poor!!!
Having to board was a mother challenge as only one gate is operational and many African and middle eastern flights depart from there is was most unpleasant and Cloud 9 privileges were not in place here. It took 30 minutes and a lot of tongue biting until I could board the plane.
In Johannesburg, when checking in and getting my boarding pass for this leg too, I was informed that I would, once again be the only passenger in business class on that flight. What a bonus I thought - the reality was a nightmare to say the least. When I tried to enter the aircraft 4 cabin crew were crowding the entrance having to ask to pass to get on board. it took a further 20 minutes before I got some water and when asked if there was sparkling wine I was offered, to my horror the wine was warm not chilled at all pointing this out just a shoulder shake that was all. Luckily I was the only one in business class so I could change the seat as mine was a rocking chair!
The dinner was uneventful ok and the red wine, a new bottle was opened for me, was super.
Ethiopian Airlines, if you guys want to attract business class passengers from other airlines you must avoid this big peak & valley in service and not even attention to detail, just customer service. On this flight the cabin crew's attitude appeared to be that I was a bother to them - that they would have preferred to have no one on the flight.
The constant chatting up front did not add charm to the flight.
Had this been my first flight with Ethiopian - never again - I will try once more if if this is a flow, you have lost me as a passenger forever so fix it!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5ChrisP,Chris P wrote a review Oct 2018,Chris P,"Bengaluru, India",18 contributions,10 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Muscat Governorate,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r625278553-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The Chaos at Addis Ababa Airport could put me off using the Airline again.,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The return journey from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa was again in an Airbus A350-900 with the same seat configuration of 2-2-2. When boarding was called we were held up standing in the airbridge leading to the aircraft whilst the cleaning crew rushed to finish their job. We could have waited comfortably seated at the boarding gate. Sad when communication lets us done.

"Having just arrived from Muscat with a very short transit time in Addis Ababa - 50 minutes and having to negotiate chaotic conditions at Bole Airport, I thanked my lucky stars that I had booked business class, Cloud 9 at Ethiopian. Cloud 9 passengers have special boarding gate/s and exclusive bus service to the aircraft parked on the tarmac far away - a Airbus A350-900 (ET-AVC) brand new.
Business class was ½ full - seat configuration 2-2-2 I had chose the middle seat, a nice compact shell - lie flat seat nice big screen but less frills as other business class seats but adequate. Great service super selection of food served from a trolley and flying out of Addis Ababa we got a selection of Ethiopian dishes 4 in total to choose from on top of the regular items. fine selection of South African wines with a French Red. friendly service made the flight most pleasant and we arrived on time in Johannesburg. For the price I paid for a return ticket, it was a third less then the usual gulf carriers I used before it was more then adequate and I will use this airline again.

"This flight ET852 was to Addis Ababa and connecting to flight ET700 to London. At check in we were informed that the flight was going via Entebbe in Kenya to refuel and drop off passengers and to pick up new ones. Total disorganisation as we were booked onto seats in rows 16 and 28. As a couple on a long haul flight this was unacceptable. After referring to someone in authority we were eventually booked onto seats together. At Entebbe there was a scramble as seated passengers had to move to other vacant seats to allow embarking passengers to take up their seats. What chaos, the flight staff could not cope.

What if there had been a technical fault with the aircraft, we did not have visas for Kenya. We would have been herded into internal airport rooms until a flight was available. I do not think this would have been a pleasant experience. Fortunately the aircraft took off on time!!

During the connecting flight to London, toilets had run out of toilet paper, one sink was left to overflow and there was very little cabin service to provide adequate drinks of water. The touch screen entertainment on one seat did not function, we shared one set of headphones to view one screen, limiting our viewing options. We were greeted with the magazine rack behind one seat being left with litter and empty cans of drink.

On landing, cabin staff did not enforce passengers to have their seats in the upright position and we noticed one couple who did not have their food trays cleared away and had to land with the tray table left out. All of which is against airline safety!!!

Ethiopean Airlines is using Addis Ababa as a gateway hub to all of Africa. This airport is undergoing a major refit. The toilets are very basic, although there was an attempt to keeping them clean. I think this airport will be worth a visit in a few years time, but is not very welcoming at the moment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franksT9845WY,Frank S wrote a review Oct 2018,Frank S,"Wedmore, United Kingdom",54 contributions,34 helpful votes,Antananarivo - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r625093236-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A very poor experience,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"New A350 aircraft, very spacious and roomy, excellent quality IFE and good food. Cabin crew very efficient. Very comfortable flight. Smooth check-in. So, why not top scores?

"I took a flight from Mombasa (MSA) to Toronto (YYZ) with a 3hr layover in Addis Ababa(ADD). In MSA they didnt give me the second boarding pass from ADD to YYZ saying their system was down and I would get it in ADD. On arriving in ADD,i was directed to customer service who upon checking my passport and permanent residence card (PR) said that they need to verify with the embassy and i should have a seat as i wait. 45 minutes late,(while the lady assisted all other passengers) I stood up to ask her what was going on. She then gave me back my documents without any explanation and asked me to proceed to the gate. At the gate i explained i didnt have a boarding pass and another lady asked me to seat so that she can process my documents. 2 hrs later,and after the call to board I stood up to ask them what was going on. The lady referred me to another person who then told me their system was down. After pleading that I would miss my flight i was given a baording pass with a different seat number almost at the end. At first i sat patiently both  times as I thought maybe something was wrong with my documents. Turns out it was their system all along and instead of communicating with me they were just indifferent to my plight. I wouldnt recomend this airline to any of my friends after what i went through.

"Ethiopian Air: Worst in-flight experience - Ethiopian Airlines

Flight ET502 Sept. 22 from Addis to Toronto via Dublin. It is a 16-hour night flight when you consider the 1.5-hour refuelling in Dublin along the way.

I had decided to try to sleep as much as possible in order to be able to function at my work when I arrived in Toronto. That meant deliberately booking a window seat, 22A. The flight was a bit late leaving, making it approximately 11:30pm before we were in the air. I put on the eye-shades and noise cancellation headphones and leaned on the window. No-one would interrupt my sleep in order to use the toilet, or that was my thinking at least.

My travel companions 22B and 22C were engaged in a discussion: 22B was an older Somalian man, he tapped my arm to wake me. He gestured that he had a headache and asked whether I had a painkiller. I did not have painkillers but the woman in 22C gave him an Advil. He proceeded to snap his fingers and wave his hands to gain the attention of the stewardesses who were preparing for take-off. He managed to get immediate attention for a glass of water to help wash down the painkiller.

I resettled into the window, only to have this man jab my arm repeatedly over the next hour. He fidgeted restlessly, tossing this way and that. He had claimed both arm rests for his own use but that wasn’t enough and started to spill over to my space. I would just start to fall asleep and he would jab my arm with his arm as he fidgeted about. I asked him to please be considerate, that I was trying to sleep, and pointed to the natural boundaries of the armrest. But it didn’t stop.

After about an hour the woman in 22C could no longer tolerate the man’s fidgeting and asked the stewardess to move her. I took the opportunity of this disruption to use the washroom facilities, but on my return I found this man stretched out over all three seats. I asked him politely three times to move but he waved me dismissively away and continued to occupy the entire 22A -22C row, including my seat. I called a stewardess who, after a few attempts, managed to get him to reluctantly move enough so that there was space for me – he took possession of my seat 22A and had his feet curled up on 22B. He refused to give me my bag and my shoes; I had to grope around to retrieve them, and I had to move his shoes from under the 22C seat – he already had claimed that space as his own.

I was annoyed that I lost the window seat and missed the opportunity for catching some sleep but decided to take it with good grace. Unfortunately this man continued to disturb me. He leaned his feet right up against my thigh and pushed so that I was squeezed into as small space as possible. I repeatedly asked him to stop and pushed his feet away from my legs. I asked the stewardesses to intervene but he continued his behaviour as soon as they were gone. He put his feet in my lap at one point, at which I pushed him away. He swung up and glared at me and I realized that this was not going to end well.

I went to the stewardesses and asked that something be done about this man. “What can we do?” was the answer I received.

What they could have done was move the man as soon as he was behaving badly and before all the other passengers had settled into sleep. What they could have done was insist that he move out of my assigned window seat and move to the now vacated aisle seat 22C. What they could have done was move me into a business class seat so that I could get some peace from this inconsiderate passenger. What they could have done is move this man to another seat in order that he could no longer disturb my flight experience.

What they did was find a spot for me between two sleeping passengers.

Lets do the math here. The man wanted all 3 seats and behaved so badly that he eventually got his way. He slept like a baby on all three seats. The passenger of 22C no longer had an aisle seat, she was wedged between two other passengers. I no longer had a window seat. I was wedged between two passengers who had already settled into sleep, disturbing them as I resettled.

I have travelled with Ethiopian Air since 1985. This experience has tainted my otherwise positive impression of the airline. Surely your in-flight staff have training in dealing with difficult passengers? Surely the decision should be to move the disturber rather than those passengers that have been disturbed? I have no doubt that if the stewardesses had placed this man beside the tall, bulky Ethiopian man I eventually sat beside, he would have been forced to behave himself.

The in-flight staff were ineffectual and my passenger rights were infringed upon.

Ethiopian Airlines, you need to manage unruly passengers a whole lot better than you do.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funk-blouw,funk-blouw wrote a review Oct 2018,funk-blouw,"Victoria, Canada",1 contribution,,Addis Ababa - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r624893121-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Women Beware: Worst In-flight experience,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Second flight experience with Ethiopian Airlines. This time, the flight was from Cape Town to Singapore with transit at Addis Ababa.

As I mentioned before, the airline itself was pretty good, clean plane, comes with wide range of in-flight entertainment, staff was normal (unless you are trying to be difficult), and the food seems decent and pretty good to me. They kept feeding you.

The transits in ADD can be terrible for those who are not used to such travel condition. There were only a few security clearance points with long queues and people trying to cut into the lines.

"Traveled with Ethiopian Airlines from Singapore to Victoria Falls, with transit at Addis Ababa.

The airline itself was pretty good, clean plane, comes with wide range of in-flight entertainment, staff was normal (unless you are trying to be difficult), and the food seems decent and pretty good to me.

Connection at ADD can be improved. Slow at the boarding gate due to the internal bus that we need to wait to transfer us to the next connecting flight.

"The staff were friendly and efficient on my flight from Hong Kong to Addis, however, the in-flight entertainment and food could be improved.

"I can't respect a company which changed my flight without any warning. I was left for 24 hours in a cheap and dirty hotel in Addis Ababa without any explanations. There was only one big lie - 'There is no flight tonight"". There was a plane, I heard the agent, calling the passengers for Muscat - like a shepherd - shouting in front of the ladder (the transfer is the following: from one plane to the other one, the stay at the airport is eliminated so if you need a rest room or something else between two long flights, be brave and keep your needs for the last destination.) All my attempts to resolve the situation at the airport were unsuccessful. (I even tried to buy a new business class ticket.) My agenda was crashed. Will not describe my experience at the airport on the next day - the check-in, the passport and security controls. I don't wish such moments even to my enemies :) That's why I don't intend to use the service of Ethiopian Airlines again. And, yes, the planes were good and the crews were kind...

But on return journey food choice was better. But bread was not hot. Flight was full , most travellers were transit in Addis Ababa travelling to many other destinations in Africa, when returning heard from one Malawi travelling to London sitting with us that in Africa had three choices , South African , Kenyan and Ethiopian Airlines, of these three he stated Ethiopian Airlines slightly cheapest. Enough leg room, one thing noticed seats couldn’t be bent much backward , therefore no discomfort from person sitting in front leaning his / her seat back at 45 degree angle. Hope all airlines follow this. Because.most passengers were in transit boarding card was not handed carefully,before landing in Addis Ababa . I collected boarding card when served in other row , my row was not served,baggage came alright and enough trolley to carry bags, when retuning to Heathrow our baggage came last noticed transit passengers had their baggage first and we or similar who boarded in Addis Ababa got their baggge last.

"I had to go from Mumbai to Sao Paulo, and the flight options are limited. After much deliberation, I chose Ethiopian Airlines, since it gave me longer time to sleep between Mumbai and Addis Ababa vs. Mumbai to Doha or Dubai. I also did my research to find that the airline was rated 4 Star on Skytrax and also a Star Alliance member - both an assurance of sorts.

My onboarding experience in Mumbai was quite pleasant. I met with a senior person from the airline in the Business Class counter. I shared with him that I had thought about flying Ethiopian 10 years back, but did not since they did not have flat beds at that time. He assured me that Ethiopian has undergone a sea change in last 10 years.

The flight experience was quite good. The business class is quite spacious. They have indeed revamped their fleet with Dreamliners. The cabin crew was also very responsive and served with a smile. Perhaps the only challenge was lack of understanding of English with some crew members, but that did not come in way of services a lot.

The transfer in Addis Ababa was also quite smooth, though the airport is quite crowded and I realised that Addis Ababa perhaps serves as one of the largest hubs in Africa, thanks to growing fleet of Ethiopian (you can see 20-30 Ethiopian Dreamliners parked when you land).

My flight to Sao Paulo got diverted to Rio and then reached Sao Paulo. But that was caused by very heavy rains in Sao and had nothing to do with airline.

On return, when I web checked-in the previous day, the web check-in information displayed that the flight was delayed (4:50 am instead of 1 am). I was concerned about missing the connecting flight, so I called up the airline office, and was told that connection would still be made. In a way, I was fine since this gave me some time to sleep before taking the flight.

When I reached the airport at 2:40 am (terminal 2), I could not locate anyone from Ethiopian there. I asked the Latam team and they told that Ethiopian team had left a couple of hours back and flight had taken off at 1 am!! I had the boarding pass with me that had 4:50 am as departure time. There was no one from Ethiopian at the airport to help on this. And the flight status still showed 4:50 am departure. I was not sure what to do, but resolved that taking Ethiopian again with this experience would be challenging (in spite of a good crew). Ultimately, I got a seat in Air France, which would take me back 14 hours later than planned.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suv98198,suv98198 wrote a review Oct 2018,suv98198,"Mumbai, India",1 contribution,,Sao Paulo - Mumbai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r621269757-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Reasonable flight experience, but on ground handling needs massive improvement",Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

So my family plan the trip of a life time....Africa.  Cape Town Victoria falls and safari in Kenya. 3 exciting and adventurous weeks.  My parents leave a few days earlier for extra time to adjust to time difference.  We show up and suddenly all these issues checking in needed a new credit card for our 10K flights.  No explanation just could be an issue with the original payment  WHAT??? Original payment you mean that one we paid for 6 months ago. Even the supervisor was not able to give a good reason.  So needless to say handed over my credit card again and have been watching for charges.  UNBELIEVABLE... RUDE AND NO REASON.  However once on the plane the flight crew was so helpful and accommodating....then guess what we go to check in in Nairobi and the exact same message I told the lady at the counter that she had better speak with her manager and if a solution to her problem wasn't solved I expected to speak with them....no clue how they manage billing but surely in this day and age they can arm their staff with accurate information about what'd been paid for and what hasn't...could have been a higher rating because otherwise was fine but give your check in team some information!!!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c0728,C0728 wrote a review Oct 2018,C0728,"Hamilton, Canada",62 contributions,12 helpful votes,Toronto - Cape Town Central,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r621078655-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Could have been higher rating,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Used Turkish to Madagascar and Ethiopean home, so it was easy to compare.
I really like the Turkish Business due to better seats. Your feet have a wide place to be compared to EThiopeans small narrow hole. This is due to the fact Airbus - 300 vs Boing DReamliner.
The food is 100% better in Turkish with more choices and better quality for breakfast to Dinner.
The only thing which I liked for the Ethiopean is the Entertainment system with it's big screen. But the headsets are really plastic and uncomfortable..

To make a perfect Business product:
- Use Airbus business seats
- Use Boeing ""Dreamliner"" Entertainment system
- Use Turkish headset
- Use Turkish meny for food and drinks

Since then, we have been trying to get a reasonable answer for this, but no one, not even someone among the senior people of the airline had the decency to even answer our claim.

"I traveled on Ethiopian Airlines twice during the month of September 2018. Once from Accra, Ghana to Addis Ababa, and again from Addis Ababa to Seoul, Korea. They had two opportunities to impress me, and failed on both occasions. The crew lacked motivation when it came to discipline and customer service. Example one: During the flight from Accra to Addis, there happened to be an Ethiopian Airlines crew member that was traveling as a passenger, in uniform, I might add. As the plane taxied for take-off, she was on her cell phone talking, and when I pointed this out to a flight attendant that happened to be sitting near by, the flight attendant's reply was a nonchalant ""we're getting ready to take off.""  Example two: During the flight from Addis Ababa to Seoul, with the flight being so long, I would get up to stretch, walk, etc. During my walks to the galley, I noticed several flight attendants propped up against bulkheads sleeping.

"I was surprised to find that Ethiopian is the largest African airline and has a relatively young fleet.

While the actual seat was a bit out of date, and several of the buttons did nothing, it was huge (by comparison to LH, UA, BA, etc.) At 6'3"" I could actually stretch out and sleep. Also, the bed was full-width at the bottom (my feet were not jammed into a tiny cubbyhole).

The service was adequate but the food was dreadful (both the Ethiopian and western). Note that they really try to serve passengers bot a full Ethiopian and western entree. But then I don't fly for the food. The beer was cold and the Johnnie Walker Black was free-flowing, so I was happy.

The lounge at ADD was adequate, but the lounge at NBO was a disgrace (use the Turkish Airline lounge instead).

"I flew Business going to Malawi from LA and the flight was OK.  Or must say much better than flying back with Economy.  Return flight was full.  I was with my husband and daughter.  We were assigned seats all over the plane.  My daughter's seat was by the window and water/moister from A/C or somewhere was dripping on her and she was all wet.  All they offered was a blanket to cover her head for the duration of the flight (22 Hours!)! My husband was sitting on an isle seat and the seat was broken.  I was sitting by the toilets! After about 8-9 hours flight we had a stop at Dublin for 3 hours.  However, no one was allowed to get off the plane!  only for passengers to leave and others to board.

"""Ethiopian???"" Friends reaction when I told them of my upcoming adventure to the heart of Africa. ""Are they safe? "" etc etc.
Well I didn't know anyone who had flown with them previously so I was a little unsure myself. Would there be chickens and goats in the isles?
No need to worry! A great experience from start to finish
Nice new aircraft with good leg room in economy. The crew were very helpful and friendly and the food.. the food was among the best airline meals Ive had. Tasty with an African slant and really good sized portions.
In flight entertainment is one area that could improve. Fairly limited film and program choices for English speaking passengers, but hey this was not a ""British"" flight.

I have flown Ethiopian a few times in Biz Class purely because of the value for money compared to other airlines. It is by no means 5 star but you get what you pay for. On my June trip I had a 8 plus hour layover. I was given a hotel voucher at the Hilton and shuttles where arranged between the airport and the hotel including meal vouchers. Please be aware that if you are leaving the airport and you have more than $3000 then you must declare it at customs before leaving the airport. I ended up in a heap of crap because the rules has changed. Before if you where in transit for less that 24 hours then you did not have to declare. There are no announcements on the aircraft so just be aware of this fact.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RafikS_12,Rafik Sonday wrote a review Sep 2018,Rafik Sonday,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",26 contributions,26 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Guangzhou,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r619621401-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Biz Class not bad for the price,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The best thing about most Ethiopian biz class flights is a full flat bed seat. But what stood out on this flight was my spotting two other biz class passengers, sat on the padded foot rests next to the bulkhead in front of their seats - the set next to each other, having a casual conversation before take off...and they actually looked comfortable. I swear it could have been a living photograph from an airline catalog. Of course, I found a way to introduce myself to them and find out if they were over 5'2"". They were! That, is how spacious these seats are.

If there was anything negative to say, there's actually two items:
1. The movie selection for this flight was a bit lame. Instead of the usual categories of different film genres, on this flight, there was just one rotating list of a few dozen movies (most, I hadn't heard of).
2. I don't understand why the Ethiopian Airlines safety video has women dancing in swimming outfits while demonstrating emergency floatation device use at the airline's training facility pool (presumably functional for training, not a recreational pool).

"My first flight with Ethiopian airlines was way back in 1991. Over the years, I've had the opportunity of traveling with them on my three trips to Ethiopia not to mention my numerous trip in the 90s to Kenya. I have always considered them the best airlines in Africa.
However, my recent trip left me abit disappointed with the level of service especially my return trip from Dubai to Abidjan. Got to the airport in Addis on transit just to be told that the flight between Addis and Abidjan was overbooked so I had to spend 26hrs in Addis. The lady at the airport wasn't pleasant and dismissive. Unfortunately the hotel (Sun City) I was taken to is more of a motel with extremely low standards.

"THE most indifferent airline I have flown with absolutely no concern for its customers. I had to change a return flight while visiting family as my mum was rushed to hospital for a medical emergency. Probably the only airline that I have come across that would not grant leniency in fare changes on medical grounds even though we offered to provide evidence. My sister who flew Qatar was able to change her flight at a nominal charge. In any case I had no choice but to change my flight which was then ticketed a day before my original departure date and I went to make the payment at the airport office in Nairobi. Their systems were down and the attendant was unable to access the system. With no other alternative offered by Ethiopian (they couldn’t access any booking) and having waited over 45mins, I was told to check the following day. Called into the office the next day and ET confirmed as long as I made payment before flying my booking would be valid and the charge would be the same. Imagine my surprise when they then charged me an additional $50 for a no show even thought they had changed my flight the day before I flew and it was their system failure that had prevented me from making the payment. Tried to explain to the Nairobi reservations office disclosing all the names of the staff to substantiate my situation but seems like their problem resolution strategy is to frustrate their customers by placing their calls on hold endlessly time and time again. Terrible experience and will never fly them again.

"The Gaborone - Addis Ababa flight was delayed and as a result I missed my connecting flight to Cairo (Egypt) as well as the one from Cairo to Athens (Greece). I had to queue for three & half hours (2230-0200 hours) to reach a counter where I could be issued new boarding passes. Upon reaching the counter, the staff did not even apologise, but rather told me to come back at 0300 hours. I finally manage to depart Addis Ababa at 0415 hours on a different airline and obviously reached my destination very late. Upon arrival at Athens I found that my luggage was missing. Although I finally found my luggage five days later, this spoiled my experience.

Judging by the length of the queue of the people who wanted to be issued with new boarding passes, it is clear that the airline has problems of delays.

The staff were such a pleasure to deal with, so friendly & helpful.
The airline provide blankets, eye masks and socks to make the journey more comfortable, they also give a children's pack with games, colours, colouring books - a lovely idea and something the kids certainly enjoyed! There's such an array of movies & games available on the screens in front of you, kept the kids entertained for hours! Earphones are provided for each passenger.

"Here's an update to my earlier review.  The saga continues...After getting stuck in Addis Ababa overnight due to Ethiopian Air's internal screw ups (see the 7 critical mistakes they made on my previous review), we showed up the next night to check in to our re-booked flights.  The incompetence continued:  8) at the last minute they changed our flights (again) leaving on a later flight via Frankfurt, 9) we were given $600 vouchers for our inconvenience.  We told them we would never fly Ethiopian Air again, but were assured several times by the Customer Service Mgr on duty (Biruk D) that we could redeem the vouchers for cash at any Ethiopian Air ticket counter.  This was (another) misrepresentation to push off off to someone else because when I called the US Customer Service office they told us once the vouchers are issued they cannot be redeemed for cash - that needed to be done at time of issue in Addis Ababa - but instead we would have to use them to fly Ethiopian Air again, 10) then it went from ridiculous to surreal... after they started the boarding process and the entire flight was lined up in the jetway to enter the plane they discovered that no one had the right key to open the doorway at the end of the jetway into the aircraft.  So we sat there with a couple hundred other passengers crammed into the jetway waiting for someone to arrive with the key.  Several people came and went but no one could find the right key, even though we could see that the pilot and crew had already boarded and were waiting hopelessly on the other side of the locked gate on the plane.  Finally after 40 minutes a couple people from maintenance came and hacked off the lock in one of the most dangerous hack jobs I've ever seen.  Some people were begging the mgr to stop it in fear for the maintenance peoples safety.  Some people were filming it while the Cust Svc Mgr frantically tried to block their iPhones.  They finally got it off. 11) over an hour later we finally pulled away from the terminal only to hear a loud thump.  Sounded like we ran over something (maybe a block left to chock up the tires? - hopefully not a person).  So sure enough, we had to pull back into the gate.  They announced over the loudspeaker that someone on the plane was sick, but I saw no evidence of that.  We finally departed over 2 hours late, 12) to top it all off - even though we were assured that our bags would be rerouted to SFO on the new flights - that never happened.  I filed a lost luggage claim but to date the bags are nowhere to be found.It really makes you wonder if so many elements of this organization are that incompetent, is it really safe to fly??",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/21/73/b7/b4/mikeofsanjose.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeofSanJose,MikeofSanJose wrote a review Sep 2018,MikeofSanJose,"Morgan Hill, California",12 contributions,10 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - San Francisco,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r618434679-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,UPDATE: WORST AIRLINE EVER,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I recently flew Business Class (Cloud 9) from Newark to Kilimanjaro and from Entebbe back to Newark for our honeymoon to Tanzania and Uganda.  Candidly, we were pleasantly surprised as the level of service on the flight. Our attendants were really good and we loved loved the food.  The seats were comfortable and the entertainment options were decent.  The reason for 4 stars is because one of our seats on one of our flight legs was not in the best working order (not too much of a big deal), the airport in Ethiopia is a mess (disorderly and run down) and also because we sent a customer inquiry regarding our flights in August, received an automated email and have yet to hear back.  Nevertheless, it was an economical flight for Business class and we were able to do all legs of our trip with Star Alliance/United points.  Our biggest fear was our bags not getting to and from Africa since we had multiple legs on the trip and thankfully we had no issues.  The lounges to which Cloud 9 provided access (Star Alliance and Cloud 9) were good and they helped a great deal during our layovers in Entebbe and Ethiopia.  I think Ethiopian airlines is a great value if flying on Cloud 9.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRealMartiago,Martiago wrote a review Sep 2018,Martiago,"Jersey City, New Jersey",32 contributions,17 helpful votes,Newark - Kilimanjaro National Park,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r618425471-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Honeymoon Flight to Africa,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"""This is a short visit, surely nothing will go wrong."" I said to myself recalling my past nightmares with inland travel on ET in the past. I applaud Ethiopia for keeping things moving in a difficult environment but my last trip left me underwhelmed. I arrived at about 9.00 pm but only managed to clear through immigration past 11.00 pm! Only the parents with really young children braving the winding queue made me think ""It could have been worse!"" Armed with my past experience, I was determined to get things right...confirm my return flight ASAP...I shouldn't have bothered. I was checked in...only to get turned away at the boarding gate. The flight was overbooked and I was to be collateral damage! After more than two hours waiting to be allocated a hotel where I would have to wait till late afternoon for the next flight, I had to stand in a long immigration queue...again. Along with some other unfortunate Africans (I also noticed that most of those bumped off the ET flights were African ...coincidence maybe) we were driven to Afarensis Hotel whose staff acted like they were doing us a big favour, serving us an excuse of a lunch before we could head back to the airport. The airline linking its clients to such poorly managed establishments says something about them. I will not say ""never again"" but given other options, I will take them over Ethiopian Airlines which I can recommend for those who have a lot of time on their hands.

I flew from Namibia heading to Dubai and transited in Addis Ababa.  However our flight was late and we missed it. When i got to the terminal the agent at the desk told me to wait  for the next flight and assured that we will be on it. I waited for about 2 hours then the gate opened to board. I went to thd agent again to double check if i can join the que and he said we should wait until everyone else boarded. We where about 20 people  who waited on the side.. fortunately the flight was full. When we spoke to the agent  he said we will have to fly tomorrow  because this one is over booked..Which does  not make sense why he asked us to wait while he clearly know its overbooked. We we told that we should  go to customer service for the hotel passed. As we reached the customer service  there was no organization at all. The agent  looked totally  unaware of what to do..we waited  in the que for another  2 and half  hour. The long wait had two ladies faint. The Hotel  we where in was Churchill hotel. We where not given  water to drink. No Towels in the room and the cleanliness of the rooms  i dnt want to mention. As an airline  i would  suggest that you train  your staff on how to handle  this types  of situations without  the guest feeling  it. If the flight is full dnt make people  wait  book them  a hotel  which is good and clean  for them to rest.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prokanzis,Pro Spike Ka wrote a review Sep 2018,Pro Spike Ka,,4 contributions,,Windhoek - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r618083441-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Poor customer service. ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"For our large family trip (14 of us) to Madagascar we investigated quiet a few airline options and we went with Ethiopia Airlines.
Here's the good:
- Ethiopia Airlines had the option to bypass Tana and just go direct to Nosy Be which we preferred
- By far the cheaper option by at least $500-$600 per person. With 14 of us that was significant savings
- Service was good - pleasant staff and crew
- Lots of in-flight entertainment options, movies, games
- Because we were in a long flight - total flight time of 21 hours - we had to stay overnight in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The airline takes care of the hotel accommodations and transport. The process was easy and efficient.

What needs improvement:
- We had a long flight so we actually got to eat 6 total meals on the plain. After the 4th meal - I did not want to eat their chicken and rice meal. Some variety would have improved the experience.
- We never took off on time on the any of our flights and always were delayed by at least two hours.
- The actual planes are a bit older and could use some revamping.

Overall - I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised that it was a solid travel experience. I would consider flying Ethiopia Airlines again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicacT1883NP,Monica C wrote a review Sep 2018,Monica C,,28 contributions,9 helpful votes,Newark - Nosy Be,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r618038234-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Pretty solid - pleasantly surprised,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"WORST AIRLINE EVER! I’ve traveled to over 40 countries on countless airlines. I thought I’d give Ethiopian a try since they were significantly cheaper. THE GOOD: cheap and pretty nice planesTHE BAD: 1) several months after we booked our flight they decided to cancel one of our flights and never notified us. Luckily I checked on the status a couple months in advance & found out about it, but 2) trying to get anything done online like rebooking  flights, getting seat assignments, etc. is very frustrating 3) talking to the online customer service reps was not much better. No one really had much information, nor did they really seem to care to help. 4) when they rebooked our flights (due to their cancellation) they rebooked us with a very tight connection in Addis Ababa. I should have known better but I was assured by 3 different customer service agents including a supervisor and manager that it would be no problem because they would hold the flight to Washington DC since we were coming in from Cape Town. 5). they didn’t hold the flight. We sprinted through the airport and made it to the gate just as they closed the doors - you’d think they would have known there were people on the connecting flight and would have held it for 15 min. there were at least 15 other people who also got stranded. 6) rebooking at the airport was a joke. It took us 2 over hours to rebook  The computers kept going down. Nobody knew what was going on. Agents kept leaving their stations to go chit-chat to one onother. Noone helped show us where to go. 7) so we were stranded in Ethiopia. They put us up in a decent hotel, but we had to drive another 1/2 hour to  get there through downtown Addis Ababa in the middle of the night with civil riots going on. 8) service and meals on the flight were marginal at best and we flew Business ClassOVERALL: an absolute nightmare of an experience.

The 2nd flight had a bit of complication because one out of 2 connecting flights got cancelled and we only found out about 15 hours before the flight. We went to their office in Kigali and they found a suitable alternative for us with an overnight stay in a hotel in Addis.

"Overall I had a terrible experience.

Leg 1 (Delhi to Bole)

The oldest plane I have ever flown on, smelt of urine. Air hostesses clearly did not want to be flying this plane and this route.

Layover (Addis Ababa)

When you arrive in transit from India you are shuffled straight back to where the gates are, you do not pass security. The section you fly from restricts where you can go. On this side of security there is no refreshments for sale.

My luggage was left in a rain storm and cost me $300 to get cleaned as I was staying in a 5* hotel when I arrived. My email complaint has not been replied to after one month.

Way back

Flight was delayed 24 hours - luggage lot - put in a hotel - told to come back at 2pm - when we arrived at 2pm were told flight goes at 2am. They just wanted to make sure we checked out of the hotel...

I could write a lot more, but don't want to think about it ever again. The airline is now banned from my company. Not because of the bad flights, delays etc...that happens.

"My husband and I took a return flight from Accra to Nairobi in August. We found the staff to be quite unhelpful. It took 30 mins for any in-flight request (water, blanket, etc) to be responded to let alone fulfilled which was only made worse by the fact that the attendants on my flight were rude. On our way back to Accra we arrived at JKIA in Nairobi in ample time, however, because we used a credit card to purchase our tickets we were required to verify our credit card. We did this in Accra but were not aware we would be required to do it again on the return leg. So we leave the check in line and see the manager. At this point the manager is the only person available to verify the card, which of course meant long wait times. Finally we return to check in and the desk attendant wrongly checks our bag to Addis and not Accra. When we realize the mistake, the bag has just barely gone down the conveyor belt, and in my opinion could have been easily retrieved without inconveniencing other passengers (given we were now very few going through the check in process). Instead she informs us she will change it in the system and that all will be fine. It has been almost a month and our bag is no where to be found. A situation which could have been avoided if the attendant, who could not have been less bothered about her mistake, had simply gone for the bag and changed the tag. The airline has been unhelpful and unsuccessful in locating our luggage giving standard responses such as ""we are tracking your bag"" etc.I have sent a detailed description and picture of the bag. And the airline sent us completely different bag (nothing like i described AND padlocked). This demonstrates either a lack of communication between offices since a picture of my bag should be in the system or carelessness. I understand that this happens. But the poor service from beginning to end ruined the experience for me and made the loss of my bag less accidental and more a result of negligence.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/72/09/81/naa-barkor-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naabarkorp,Naa Barkor P wrote a review Sep 2018,Naa Barkor P,,3 contributions,2 helpful votes,Accra - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r617611999-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Unhelpful,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Firstly, I fly between Madagascar and Dakar a lot ... After reading many reviews, especially the bad ones, I decided to try ethiopian for a change.. What a pleasant surprise that was. Check in at Antananarivo Airport was fast, efficient and friendly. Got both boarding passes and a hotel night complimentary for the 18 hrs transit and it was the Hilton. 737-800 business class was great even though the seat would not recline flat, it did recline enough to sleep comfortably for a couple of hours. Crew and food was great. Arrived in Addis Ababa on time, followed the instructions to get the hotel transfer and didn't have to wait much. Slept well at the Hilton and was taken back to the airport for the second leg to Dakar, via Bamako. Took off ontime again, amazing cabin, looked brand new even though it was the older 767-300. Flat bed seats, great food and service too. On my return, flew the 777-200lr also flat bed, great food, service and drinks. Stayed overnight in Addis Ababa again, this time at the Radisson Blu, again everything on time, 737-800 again to Antananarivo. I will choose Ethiopian Airlines any time Over Air France, which is the other choice and flown them loads of times before. For the price I paid, I'll only say Christmas came early..

"I went from Paris to Bujumbura via Addis, where I had about a six-hour layover.  The boarding process in Paris was quite smooth, but leaving Addis for Buj was a joke.  Although they had queues set up for the different zones, they didn't bother to use them, and it was a bit of a free-for-all.I don't remember anything either good or bad about the flights themselves.  I had enough room to comfortably sleep for most of the flights.  I don't remember eating anything, so can't comment on the food.  Overall, I would say the flight was average.  Nothing bad, nothing outstanding.Ethiopian has a good safety rating, and I did feel comfortable with the crew's professionalism.It's a reliable airline for flying around East Africa and from there to the continent and I don't hesitate to take it, but I also don't anticipate the trip like with other airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nguigmi,Nguigmi wrote a review Sep 2018,Nguigmi,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",18 contributions,8 helpful votes,Paris - Bujumbura,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r617610529-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Etiopian Airlines - safe and reliable.,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I fly transatlantic at least 3 times a year, I consider my experience with Ethiopian Airlines the worst I ever had. The customer service was the poorest! First, the charged me $300 more than what it shoes on their app, which also wasnt great, as expected from one of the largest airlines in Africa, when I called customer service I had to wait more than 40 minutes to get to a representative that hardly spoke English and told me to Email them. When I did, they responded more than a week later saying the currency exchange was wrong and I was charged in Argentinian pesos and not in the local Ethiopian currency.  At some point, they stopped responding to my emails. When I got to Tel Aviv I found out that my belongings in the checked suitcase were broken, it was a gift to my niece and she sure was sad about it. I took pictures and sent it to the airline support email, I could only send one picture at the time. Although I sent several Email, I did not get a single response. Nothing!On the day of the flight, I had 19 hours connection stop in Ethiopia, according to their policy I was supposed to get a night in a hotel, at their expense, which I supposenly was supposed to get during the check-in. The lady at the kiosk in Tel Aviv was so rude and kept me waiting till the 15 minutes before boarding, saying I could have booked a later flight and avoid the wait, therefore I'm not entitled to an overnight stay on their expense. Needless to say that when I booked the flight there was no such option (to avoid the wait with a shorter connection). After waiting for her to contact the whole airport, and texting a couple of private friends that had nothing to do with my flight, she told me I have 15 minutes to get to the gate or I will lose my flight.  At the gate, I spoke with the ""supervisor"" who told me I should speak to the airline rep in Ethiopia, when I get there. She also screamed at me, saying its my fault for not choosing shorter connection time, even though I explained to her that I was never given the option. When I asked for the supervisor's name, and the representative's name, the laughed and spat it out fast as it was a joke to them, the lady behind me told me it wasn't even worth the bother since they know that no one is going to do nothing with my complain, if ever filed.  The rep's dest in Ethiopia didn't help much as well, but at the very least they were nice enough to plain to me that the kiosk inTel Aviv could put me on a later flight that same night and shorten my connection to 4.5 hours. They also explained that ""they should have done it"" or at least offer me that option since that flight was almost empty. As a result of poor ongoing customer service that I had to deal with, plus mean representatives that did nothing to help, I had to spend 19 hours at the not-so-travelers- friendly airport in Ethiopia. My one and only, nightmare type experience with Ethiopian airlines came to an end as soon as I landed back in Buenos Aires.

"Flight was basic. Attendants were apathetic - didn't go through the cabin to check for seat belts or if devices were switched off etc, short on meals, 1st leg of the journey had individual screens to watch on-board entertainment but 2nd leg of the journey (BOM-JNB) was on those shared drop-down screens visible every 6 rows or so.

The current airport is basically one long hall with not many places to sit and few places to eat and one or two market-esque stalls where ""tourists"" can but exorbitantly overpriced baubles. Toilets are in container type stalls. 3/4 Lounges for business class / ""Sheba Miles"" upper class cardholders. Hopefully the new construction will upgrade the whole feel of the entire airport.

Whatever you do, don't need any help at any point while you are at this airport. ""Food-court"" waitstaff are appalling (if at all they appear) and there was NEVER anyone at the information desk, unless you count the random people attempting to charge their phones at the counter.

Most disappointing, I reported a missing Hoodie in transit and was told to ask ground staff on my arrival if they could help. They could not. 3 weeks and 5 emails later (forget about messaging on Facebook) I got a very unhelpful ""We couldn't find it""

"I had a return flight in July from Johannesburg to Stockholm. Everything was fine, more leg space than in some other airlines. The food and service on board were very good.  The seats were not as comfortable as in some other airlines as the plane was not so modern.  Addis Ababa airport, not very modern,  is just very busy and one must be prepared for that. We had to change the departure gate flying to Stockholm which was a bit disruptive. The airport is very crowded.

"Our flight from Addis was delayed because of a technical problem. The information about the delay was poor, to say the least, so many people were angry and yelling at the staff at the gate. Lunch was offered in the lounge. New technical problems occurred when we were finally in the plane after a 6 hours' delay, so it took another two hours before we could leave, arriving 8 hours later that planned in Zanzibar. Throughout this experience the staff was courteous and helpful, though some could use some training in giving information to passengers.

On the way back home from Zanzibar we were told the flight was overbooked and we would be put on another flight. We were only told 20 minutes before departure time that we could fly after all, so there was a lot of stressing getting through security and into the plane.
There was no delay in Addis this time, but the staff was rude and unhelpful. My husband needed assistance in boarding the plane, we were dumped in a cold waiting hall 2 hours before the flight, just to be put in a bus together with the all the other passengers. We were given seats at the back of the plane, which is quite a long walk for someone who has problems walking. The crew just told us that the plane was full and they would not do anything about our seats, in stead they just gave my husband (who was in pain by then) a third degree about his ability to fly in the first place.

The planes were outdated and many features did not work (no sound, in flight entertainment broken, seats did not recline, table was wobbly), so I cant say I would recommend flying with Ethopian Air.

"I wouldn’t fly this airline again. Some would say you get what you paid for but this is the worst airline Iv ever used. When we left the flight was delayed and I could see drinks being served to the 1st class, when food finally come round the quality was terrible. The Tv screens where we were sat dint work although staff tried to reset them. When we got off the plan to transfer I had the worst D&V I have ever had and I ?food poisoning. On transferring to the next flight some people were in our sits so we were sat elsewhere and the Tv monitors where they were originally meant to sit dint work!

Return flights were with Ethiopian because we had booked a package with Expedia but this time we were prepared with our own food. Flight was again delayed on transfer in Ethiopia and again 1st class were given refreshments to make up for the delay. On this occasion we dint care because we were well prepared but the shocking thing was when the people sat behind us highlighted that the meal they had been given was frozen.
I was really angry because I believe I had some sort of food poising when we left UK because of poor food preparation. Staff were nice but at times food fell on the floor and was still served. The toilets were barely cleaned and on one leg of the trip toilets were few as the others were not working.

We always fly Ethiopian Ailines to Israel but from now onwards I am looking at other options. They have been using very old planes on this route with not much leg room and not a great selection of movies. Food is average whilst service is good. THe reason I normally fly Ethiopian is that normally they are the cheapest and they fly directly out of Cape Town with not too long of a lay over in Addis Ababa.

"We fly to Thailand every year and decided to try Ethiopian airlines. Cape Town to Addis Ababa was great but when we arrived in Addis Ababa we were rushed onto a bus and taken to the plane. Obviously this plane had just arrived from elsewhere, had offloaded passengers and there was no time to clean.
Our seats were occupied by others who had the same boarding pass seat number as us so we had to move to other fitlhy seats (not cleaned). The crew were not in the least helpful and we had a miserable flight to Bangkok. Having said this the return trip was perfectly OK.

"I hate this airline!!! The flights are SYSTEMATICALLY late. I had two sits and was exhausted so I put my backpack the next sit and my head on it to take a quick nap (feet on the floor, I'm not a big) and the hair hostess woke me up FOUR TIMES in one hour, alleging it wasn't allowed. SINCE WHEN!?! She literally just made up a rule to be annoying! I really, really hate this company.
Also sits must have been designed in the 50's when people were all 1.60meter tall. Everything is too small, I headrest is too low and leg room too short.

"Ethiopian is a good airline but with a number of challenges:

1. Its planes are very basic, with no Internet. Flights within Africa (connecting from Addis) are very very basic featured planes
2. Hygiene is a major challenge. Food is taken in bulk containers and dished out on plates with hands (no gloves) and no washing of hands before touching food, cutlery. Many of friends have running stomach after eating traditional food (Injira-which I personally love)
3. Lounges are cramped with no shower facilities. Restrooms are unclean and like communal toilets in a village environment. During rush hours (which is almost 24 hours), people have to wait for their turn with rancor
4. Too much non-veg food around and the quality of vegetarian and vegan food is not good. Variety is a complete miss.
5. Value for money -Low end. Since it has good connections within Africa, it gets traffic, otherwise compared to other flights/routes with better quality of food, lounges with facilities, it is an overpriced route",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/eb/91/16/ashok-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashokcanada,ashokcanada wrote a review Sep 2018,ashokcanada,"Shimla District, India",20 contributions,33 helpful votes,Toronto - Lusaka,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r617522279-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Basic flight,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In May 2018, I flew from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv on Ethiopian Airlines.From Johannesburg to Addis Ababa, the aircraft was a Dreamliner.  It was comfortable with just that little extra leg room, which made the flight a pleasant one.Service from the cabin crew was outstanding.  I spilled red wine on my T-shirt and the hostess insisted on taking the shirt and washing it for me.  The food was a little too spicy for my palate but there was nothing wrong with it at all.  In flight entertainment was good.The transit area at Addis Ababa left much to be desired.  It was far too small to cope with the number of people in transit and it became difficult to get to counters to buy simple things like a cup of coffee.The flight from Addis to Tel Aviv left a lot to be desired.  We flew in a tired Boeing 737, which was cramped and uncomfortable.  Seeing that we took off at midnight and landed at 04h20, this was particularly unpleasant and I noticed that very few passengers managed to get any sleep at all.  Having said that, the crew was very, very good and did everything they could to make sure that the flight was as pleasant as possible.

"We flew to Singapore. The tickets were slightly cheaper than flying with Singapore airlines, however, the financial saving was seen in the service provided.

The aircraft seemed stuffy and unhygienic. The seats needed a deep cleanse. The pockets infront was not cleaned out.

The hostesses need to go for hospitality training. They are unfriendly and unwilling to help. I requested a blanket for my kids 3 times. It was an over night flight and they didnt give everyone a blanket only the kids. I had 2 kids with me and none offered.

The food was terrible. Tasteless and poor quality. The snacks even worst- which was usually a roll with processed meat(polony).

The only good thing about them was their coffee.

The on board entertainment lacked as well. Not the latest movies and limited variety.

The stopover in Addis Ababa was chaos. We were sent back and forth when trying to catch our connecting flight.

I flew to Cape Town for 10 days using this airline. The vegan food was very good and the inflight service was excellent. However after 10 days in Cape Town I went to the airport to return home only to be told my “booking had expired “. I had obviously paid for a round trip ticket and was gone for less than two weeks. They said I had no seat on the fully booked flight. I had to leave the check in and find the Ethiopian Airline office to speak with someone. After about 30 minutes there it was back to the check in line for another 30 minutes while they “tried to find me a seat”. It was very stressful.

Actually I found them organized, before the flight, making relevant announcements in order to organize the flight beforehand; crew was very professional; food was good; entertainment was good, it worked. Basic equipment for comfort was provided, like headphones, blanket, pillow, and another items like toothbrush, which I found quite cute. About the seat, it can't be very comfortable when you are in economic class, but as far as it could get considering the price, it was actually good cost benefit. I have to mention that all compliments I'm stating are for the company, not anything to do with the horrible airport of Adis Ababa, which is story for another review.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discover764581,Discover764581 wrote a review Sep 2018,Discover764581,"Macae, RJ",4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Sao Paulo - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r617462423-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Great cost benefit airline,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The trip took hours longer than other flights home. We went from Kigali, south to Burundi, then to the Addis Abbaba airport. The connecting flight has a two hour delay, in the plane, sitting on the tarmac for refueling in Ireland. I think I was a total of 16 hours on that plane.
The plane was completely full, but three to four of the restrooms weren't functioning. This created long lines, and difficulties for me. I was throwing up (thank goodness for bags) but another woman had diarrhea.
The stewardesses were kind.
Water only came if you asked for it, not offered at regular intervals as in most overseas flights.
The food just wasn't worth shouting about. I refused my third meal...enough was enough. Breakfast was fine, so was the snack, but the main meal?
It is worth it to pay more and be on a better flight, and shorter flight. Another man who had flown Ethiopian begged me to be sure he was not on it again!

"During a visit in Addis Ababa I had the chance to upgrade my flight back to Sweden to Business class. It both served the purpose of giving me extra luggage but also a better service and sleep on my way back home. In the past I have been travelling a lot with long distance flights both in First Class, Business and Economi. In private I ofthen fly economy but upgrade when needed and this was the perfectvtime since I had ”a lot” of extra luggage. Check in went smoth, and the lounge in Addis was ok. The business seats in the plane are excellent, and so was the drinks, BUT the international food was boring and tasteless. Probably the local Ethiopian food would have been a better choise.

"Was on transit flight at ADDIS ABABA airport at 11:20pm 1-Sep-2018 to SG.  Entering the departure waiting hall was a scary experience due to the mass crowd of passengers queuing to pass the security check for their flights that scheduled to take-off almost at the same time, or around 10 mins gap, to other Asian destination.  Luckily managed to pass the security check on-time.  Then, at the boarding gate, several queue line were formed at almost every departure gate.  Very confusing.  Found out later that, some of the passengers were just joining the queue even though the queue was not for his/her flight.  Guest what?  Under this situation, my boarding took longer time, and the flight also delay the take-off.  There was no proper communication from the Ethiopian Airline staff regarding the delay of the boarding time and no proper handling procedure of the crowd.  And the electronic sign-board of the boarding gate just changed to other schedule flight number and time eventhough the queue of the previous scheduled flight was not cleared yet, and I believed this was the reason other passengers who came in later just joint the queue after seeing the display of the electronic sign board.  On the other hand, the service on the plane was satisfactory in terms of food and drink, entertainment and crew.  However, one of the toilet had water leakage from the basin and had a minor flood on the floor.

"Where do I start probably on hold which is were I spent most of my time.
We booked a flight to leave on August 29th. Ticket said 29th, boarding pass had the 29th on it twice and that we were boarding at 11:45 and right below that it said 29th. Turns out that the flight leaves at 00.30 on the 29th so boarding was 28th. No mention of this anywhere. So lets start with that, I will take responsibility. No one in the airport when we arrived, all the numbers on the website are only taking messages. One number had me on hold for an hour, then I finally got through to a number in Ethiopia and spent an hour on the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes before I got an answer. Spoke to one rep who said it was my fault and the next flight was in two days and it would cost me $1,500 for the three tickets. I asked for a supervisor to see if they would help me out and waive the change fee all he did was recite the policy and to let me know he could not help. I asked for his boss and he said the same and hung up on me.
I called the number again on my drive back to San Diego, spent another two hours on hold with no answer. Called the following morning, on hold for two hours so I hung up. Got a number for DC so I called and after one hour someone picked up. Told me should couldn't do anything and when I asked for her supervisor, her response was I asked and he said he couldn't help. $1,300 was the best she could do, she gave me the cell of the Ethiopian manager in LAX and her extension so I could call back and book if that is what I wanted to do. I called the LA manager and left her a message, she texted me back that she couldn't take the call and to leave a message and she would call me back. I texted her back to let her know that I needed to speak about my flight issues and she responded that she couldn't take my call and I should call the ticket office which I did and of course I was on hold again. I needed to take care of flights so I called the DC office back and of course I was back on hold. Left messages for the lady I spoke to that morning and spoke to someone else in her office who said she couldn't help me and that I would have to wait for a call back which finally came at 4pm after In started my calls at 7am. I had to scan in a form and a picture of my Credit card and pay $1,297 to change my ticket.
We went to the airport and I made it a point to find Sasi the Manager who while giving me some sympathy about the poor service didn't really care. She said that anyone could have waived the fee if they wanted. I asked her if she could waive the fee or part of it and she said maybe she can do something if I fly with them again.
No offer of an upgrade for my family as I wasn't flying with them. No refund, she didn't even want to take my information.
As far as the flight, terrible food rude staff who woke my kids up for every part of the service. People kicking their seats on both flights and when they asked them to stop it got worse. They asked the staff to help and they didn't even ask the other people.
Never again and I am still to get a response from Sasi about my concerns.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spud6766,Spud6766 wrote a review Sep 2018,Spud6766,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Los Angeles - Dublin,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r615833963-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst Airline and customer ever,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Booked a return trip from Singapore to Buenos Aires and have to change flights at Addis Ababa. The prices were quite cheap so we decided to try this airline. Prices were different booking on computer and the phone app for the same date. I booked on the app because it was $100 cheaper?? Strange. Once you booked they allow you to select seats without charge, but it was not guaranteed. We had to re-select seats so many times because our selection was always removed. It is quite impossible to get exactly what you wanted. They should just remove the option and charge seats instead to make it easier for passengers. Flight SIN-ADD and ADD-EZE was fine. It was our flight back home, EZE-ADD that was cancelled without prior notice. We were already in the car and almost reaching Ezeiza Airport when our driver informed that the flight has been cancelled. I even did online check in 5 hours prior. No emails, no calls. When we reached airport, there was a short line of people waiting to ask questions about the flight. They told us it was cancelled due to technical problems. We were given a hotel stay in the Hotel Presidente (an old dated hotel) to stay in and fly the next day. No one was pleased. The next day we came back to the airport and there was a very long line. People from the cancelled flight and those who were supposed to fly that very day. After queueing for more than an hour, we were told that we were transferred to another airline! Why can’t they just tell us in advance? They took our mobile numbers and email. They could just tell us by email so that we don’t have to waste time queueing twice. They seriously have to look into managing things properly. Honestly I do not believe it was due to technical issues. You see, there was less than 50 people on the flight that was cancelled. I’m sure they did it deliberately. Many review of this airline is negative.

"Left Schiphol to Seychelles via Frankfurt with Luftanza and was delayed coming into Frankfurt. Due to that had to dash for the connecting flight, made it but the gate had closed however was let through. An evening flight and a bit late for dinner, but good service. A three and a half hour wait for the connection to Seychelles on a much smaller plane. The facilities at the Bole international airport isn't up to standard as yet.. Still under renovation therefore fellow travellers do carry some anti bacterial wipes with you. Seychelles leg was fine arrived without suitcases. I was however helped with some cash the next day after friends enquired. The suitcases arrived broken 2 days later. The return trip up to Ethiopia was fine but couldn't be helped with my boarding pass for the last leg of my trip from Vienna to Amsterdam. It was a bit of a nightmare as I could only obtain the boarding pass after standing in a queue for 45mins with 10 mins to spare.

"I just did the 13.5hr flight from Chicago to Addis Ababa...and was able to survive it because of the perk of being in Business class.  The service from pre-boarding, throughout the flight, and then disembarking was all really good (although I wouldn’t have expected any less). The only disappointment was that the seat definitely did not recline flat to 180degrees!! Not sure but it maybe went to 165?  The seats are also pretty dated, and could really use a recovering.  There also was only one toilet for the business class cabin of about 25ppl.  It was not the cleanliest by the end of the flight, because of overuse. However, despite those disappointments, the flight attendants were wonderful, the coffee was good, food was decent, and overall experience was good.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/ef/6e/00/larri-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larri_15,larri_15 wrote a review Sep 2018,larri_15,"Saskatchewan, Canada",73 contributions,53 helpful votes,Chicago - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r614249174-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good Business Class service ,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Good: the flight arrived at the destination safely (but not on time). The food was ok, and the leg room wasn't bad.

The Bad: The Gate agents managed to screw up our seating on every flight, both on the way there and the way back. I honestly don't understand how it is so difficult for them. Apparently they have no idea what online check-in is or how it works. In Zanzibar, we had to wait so long at the baggage check-in after we had already checked in online and had assigned seats, that we almost missed our flight. I intentionally left 3 hrs between every flight and we used every bit of it, do to their incompetence.

The Ugly: Some idiot in the company decided to but a boxing game on the touch screens on the back of the seats. A BOXING GAME! How dumb can you be? Imagine a 13 hr flight with a 4 yr old punching the back of your seat THE ENTIRE TIME! Apathetic parents wouldn't do anything about it either, despite being asked nicely multiple times. Since the flights are about 50% children, the chances of you suffering this same fate are pretty high.

"We were on a series of flights with this airline to get us from Toronto to Nairobi and back over a two week period. The flight out of Toronto was okay; however, the return flight was trying.
This airline does not seem to enforce any regulations regarding carry on baggage. Consequently, people were hauling in suitcases, duffel bags and really anything except live animals and then trying to jam it all in the overhead bins. This resulted in bins dropping open during flight and stuff falling out. The food served was mostly inedible and repetitious. Over a 12 hour flight, the same dinner was served twice and with odd combinations - pasta with meat chunks with a side of more pasta? At least the flight attendants are generous with the wine and beer to keep passengers happy (or asleep).
The cabins in the planes were shabby - torn upholstery, detached mouldings and multiple stains on the carpets. Hope the engine and avionics maintenance is more comprehensive.
I give this airline an ""average"" rating because it gets you there safely but not in physical comfort. Seating quality is acceptable though some seat back screens did not work and some fold down trays were broken. The flight attendants are friendly although stoic (and prefer snacking on the meals from first class, not economy). The flights were on time more or less but I question one pilot's decision to land during a lightening storm on approach to Addis Ababa.
Given a choice, I would opt for another airline when traveling to East Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/59/0a/39/2eratics.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2eratics,2eratics wrote a review Sep 2018,2eratics,"London, Canada",138 contributions,109 helpful votes,Toronto - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r614069080-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Gets You There but Not in Comfort,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian airways is a reasonable cheap option and if you want to fly to Botswana you do not have to go through Johannesburg.
Still while you book your flight you do not see you will have an extra short stop during your route.
The food is okay. The service depends on the staff. This time it was good. Enough drinks and handing out of blankets and so on.
The aeroplanes are very different. Not always good screens but what they offer for entertainment is a bit meagre. Not really my taste.
On our way back we had an extreme delay. We had to wait in Gaborone for a very long time. Just within limits so they did not have to hand out beverages..... but we did miss our connecting flight to Frankfurt. Addis Abbaba is chaos and even more chaos if you missed your flight. We did not really know where to go and got to a desk where they redirected us. We got a flight to London but now we were really in a hurry in all this chaos. This airport is really, really bad. Blockes toilets, lots of people everywhere. It is really crowded and gives a traveller a lot of unneccesay stress.
Well we did arrive in London and got our flight to Amsterdam but part of our luggage did not. I guess our luggage has been send to Frankfurt and it was delayed.... It did arrive at our doorstep four days later (on a sunday???).

"The cabin crew were not friendly or courteous and seemed to be 'just doing their job'.
I know we have different cultures but there was no warmth that you'd expect if you are going to be on the flight for over 10hours!
I declined the offer of one of the meals after tasting the first one.
I was asked to help myself to drinking water at the galley after asking numerous times and only getting half a tumbler, not sure if this is a policy of only offering half a tumbler?
The cabin is a very hot environment so why ration drinking water?
This was an 14-18hour trip each way.
At the Addis airport I decided to buy my own water, kept an empty bottle in the hope of replenishing it after security checks but was forced to throw the empty bottle in the bin!
Then at the airport the toilets had no toilet paper and the flushes were showering as you pressed them, oh don't!

My family always use Ethiopia Airlines each time we travel to Europe for our holidays. It’s never disappointed us at all. Although I must say Addis Ababa airport isn’t the most practical airport but the cloud nine lounge is comfortable especially if you have long layovers and with kids. The crew on the plane are super courteous and very helpful. The planes are normally comfortable and the flight smooth.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745evelynea,Evelyne A wrote a review Sep 2018,Evelyne A,"Mombasa, Kenya",81 contributions,5 helpful votes,Brussels - Mombasa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r613213411-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Awesome trip,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelled KRT-ADD-KGL on 16 Aug. 2018 on B737-800 and B737-700, respectively. Both flights delayed. Arrived in KRT 5 hours late (with Fydubai from DXB) due to closure of the airport. KRT airport had a crash and the lanes were blocked 4 hours in the morning. Had to accept No-Show and rebooking fee to ET just outside the airport. Had no visa but transit passed relatively smoothly with a lot of officers leading and attending me while retaining my passport. A humiliating experience but I know these things eventually works out well – just don’t be fuzzy. Ticket reissue went very fast, paid 100 USD cash. Both Boarding passes received in KRT which proved crucially necessary: flight became 45 Min. delayed. Bus-gatings from/to terminals throughout, very tiresome: I waited in KRT >30 Minutes with 80 passengers in a double-bus before it took-off to the aircraft 200 meters away. Transit in ADD was horrible due to hundreds of people waiting and blocking security check. Managed in last Minute to board an old 737-700 to Kigali. However, after boarding delayed >1 hour on tarmac due to “gas refuelling” discovered through the captains’ recalculation of amount needed. Services onboard were fine on both flights and could refill hot meals and drinks, inc. wine. Expensive ticket.

"Twice we experienced delay from this airline. First was coming from SG to Addis Ababa and then from Addis to Bangkok. I do understand that flight delays do happen, I do not have an issue with that. What irked my ire is that:
1. We were asked to deplane because the plane had a 'minor' damage and needed to be fixed. Seriously, after all of us settled in our seats, you asked us to go down the plane and wait for 2 freaking hours?!?
2. So inefficient ground service at AA airport, so incompetent crew, so disorganized process. It has been so chaotic that people started yelling at the attendants! Managers cant be found anywhere, we were being tossed from one place to another. It was a total disappointment!

You can afford to buy fleets and fleets of aircraft but you cant afford to invest in training your people on hiw to handle your customers. Flying is not cheap! We deserve to be treated properly.

This is a warning to all, pls. reconsider in choosing to fly this airline if you do not want your entire itinerary to be ruined. Believe the reviews, the bad ones are more accurate. No matter how cheaper their rates can get compared to other airlines, you will regret buying in the end.

"Travelling from Canada to south Africa is a long flight. It’s hard to know what to expect. I would call Ethiopian Airlines basic travel. Some of the planes we travelled on needed a bit of a facelift. Example air-conditioning systems that don’t work well, seats that are worn out. The food was adequate.

The other factor to keep in mind is that Ethiopian Airlines flights stop in Addis Ababa. That airport is a bit dysfunctional when you think about world class airports around the world.

Why has the service declined to such a state? Is management not serious about consistency, value added services, sustainability, etc.

"This was my second experience on Ethiopian airlines.
i must admit the first trip was nearly as bad, i simply thought they had a bad day, and regional flights are normally not very organised.
forced to use them again last week due to limited availability, had me worried initially, but ensured we booked business to avoid the typical chaos associated with traveling regionally.

Unfortunately, upgrading didn't help much.
Flights delayed from the morning assured absolute chaos at Nairobi, 3 flight's passengers all stuck, most of us with connecting flights...
After a very delayed departure, the situation in Addis not much better!
To add insult to injury, none of our bags arrived in Singapore, with NO communication or feedback, despite their various commitments via twitter!
A trip in [person to the Airport, liaising with Singapore luggage div eventually achieved results.
I am still waiting for a response from the airline, nearly 2 weeks later!
I normally check in online, despite class of travel, which this time really paid off.
Just when i thought things couldn't get worse, they CANCELLED our return tickets...
WHY would anyone do such a thing!?
After another day of absolute frustration and lies, we managed to get ourselves back on the flight, assured once again that everything is 100%..
Until we got to the Airport for check in...
Long story short, another hour's frustrations later, we managed, but this is not how anyone would like their travels to go, it simply ruins one's holiday/business trip by having to spend days sorting out other's incompetence...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446johant,Johan T wrote a review Aug 2018,Johan T,,14 contributions,11 helpful votes,Nairobi - Singapore,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r612497649-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst travel experience of my life!,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The worst airlines I ever travelled in my life; lack of management and false informations made me and my family with 2 and 1/2 year old stranded in the Bole airport for 24 hours. We were traveling from Nairobi to Muscat and the Nairobi flight delayed for more than 2.5 ihours resulted in missing the onward flight to Muscat. The funny fact was that the Captain did announce that the Muscat flight was waiting for us, and an ET staff separated those traveling to Muscat from the rest and got us in a bus. But alas, no one was there to guide us once we reached the terminal and after running here and there, we were informed that the Muscat flight left. They gave us no option other than to take the lousy hotel they offered for a day stay with 3 meals along with a transit visa. We had to spend an whole 24 hours without any clothes to change. They were 5 unaccompanied minors with us along with an old man who was diabetics. Later on we came to know that Muscat flight was left without us even though it was possible to accommodate us, only because it was overbooked!!!

From the hotel staff, it has come to know that they dealt almost 100-200 passengers daily in the same situation from Ethiopian Airlines.

On the top of all these, when we checked in next day, one of our seat got upgraded to Business class as they already issued the same seat to someone else and they were many other similar cases in our flight.. took more than 30 min for the staff to sort out the seating issues resulting in the delay of take off..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sc0rpionGal,Soumya wrote a review Aug 2018,Soumya,"Sydney, Australia",197 contributions,48 helpful votes,Muscat Governorate - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r612468698-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Terrible Service and high mismanagement ,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Wouldn’t recommend this airlines to anybody. I flew from Chicago to Mombasa, Kenya on August 6. When I arrived in Mombasa all four bags didn’t reach. A special event was organized by my family for my 50th birthday and I had special traditional clothes that I was supposed to wear. Our bags arrived after 3 days. We didn’t have any bare necessities not even underwear with us. We had special camera equipment which were in the baggage. Also I had special custom swim wear for beach for my skin condition. 3 days wasted. Couldn’t go to the beach or attend the party which was held in my favor. Also I had gifts for my family members who were attending the event. They had come from all parts of the country and I was meeting them after many years. It was a fiasco. I had to buy clothes and toileteries. My daughter who was traveling with me also didn’t get her baggage. She has special lotions she needs to apply. She had skin breakdown as she was not using the special lotions. When we approach d Ethiopian airlines for financial compensation for the inconveniences causes they just ignored us.

"This may take a couple of minutes of your time, but I guarantee that it will make you reconsider the airline.

To start off our trip-timeline, we flew in to Delhi on the 11th of May, around 2100 hours with a domestic airline. Our flight from Delhi to Addis Ababa was set to be on the 12th of May at 0230 hours. We were flying with Ethiopian. Lo and behold, the horror begins.

So we wait till 12:30 for Ethiopian’s check-in counter to open. While waiting in line, we notice the departure time for our aircraft, ET687, to be a little shifty. It didn’t say 02:30 on the screen. It said 05:30. An additional three hours of wait. We checked-in three bags, and two bags as carry-ons; went through security and started settling in to push those three hours till boarding. Dozed off in between and woke up only to find out that the departure time had been pushed again, by another two hours. A delay of an unaccountable nature. I’m sure you can understand the level of our frustration at this point.

We boarded, finally. But then the bigger problem was that we missed our connecting flight to Nosy-Be, a tiny island in Madagascar, that already had only a handful of flights coming in every week. When we finally got to Addis Ababa, we were made to wait in lines at the transfer desk where the lady who worked for the airline, with quite an unpleasant demeanour, gave us alternate boarding passes to another aircraft flying out that night, rerouting us through Johannesburg. It was either that or waiting a day more to catch a direct flight to Nosy-Be.

Our worry now was if whether the bags that we checked-in would travel with us to Johannesburg. Because the baggage tags had an entirely different connecting route on them. And we knew there would be a high chance of a mix-up or confusion. So we enquired to the mean lady, stressing on the part about our bags travelling with us on the alternate flight that she put us on. She assured us it will when we kept asking again and again.

All the transfers who had a later flight that day were put in hotels. It’s funny how all the Europeans/European-Americans were put in rather good hotels and all the Indians put in one hotel, and a rather questionable hotel at that. And this, quite disturbed us.

If we were travelling by, say, Emirates/Etihad, this would, not happen first of all, but second of all, if at all it did, they would be compensating our every second lost during this inconvenience. But not a shade of that basic courtesy came from this filth of an airline.

Imagine our dilemma. I forgot to mention that this was our honeymoon. Preposterous, to say the least, I hope.

And as if they hadn’t caused us enough trouble already, our flight back home from Addis Ababa was also delayed by a few hours because of an unexpected stopover to check the engines. Which only affirmed our impression of how ill-maintained the aircrafts were.

Our flight from Delhi to Cochin, if we had reached on time, was after four hours. But now the wait was only two hours because of the delay. But we land in Delhi and transfer to check-in for that flight only to find out that our tickets were cancelled, by none other than the great Ethiopian Airlines. Surely you can imagine the ruckus that we would’ve caused. And surely enough they had no choice but to put us on a later flight that day. Utter disgust for the airline at point.

Not once, not twice, but consistently causing us an inconvenience, the entire round trip, beginning till end. Severely under-compensating our every reasonable request, the airline and the people who work for it, were quite irresponsive and irresponsible in person and especially over the phone.

The overall discipline enforced by the airline associates at the counters, and at the gates, where passengers queue-up to check-in or board, is unforgivably lax. It was total chaos. And never have we seen such a haphazard service by any airline, and not to mention an international one.

My husband and I express our deepest disdain for the airline in the most animated language. Never, I repeat, NEVER in your lifetime travel with this shame of an airline, if you can help it.

"Ethiopian Airline is the worst to travel with from Houston to Lagos especially when you have a connecting flight. My mum travelled on the 18th of August 2018 and she is yet to get her 2 bags. Their customer service is the worst. The ladies hang up at will and are never ready to profer solutions. Their Lagos Office would not help the situation and only keep promising to sort it out and they never do. I think a total overhaul is needed in the customer service and Lagos airport branch. No form of remorse or follow-up advice to the customer. I call different times and different staff gives me different information about my mum's luggage. The only reasonable staff in their customer service is one ABDULKAREM. He ensured he gave me the details and was very specific with all information I needed.

"Two days layover was far too long in Addis Abbas.  Even though the airline promised free hotel and visa, it didn’t make the experience any better.

"Ethiopian may give you a confirmed seat - but once you check in, you may find that they changed it and put you were they wanted you. Seats on this long haul trip were absolutely ridiculous - once you are in, forget trying to move. The recline button had been broken so sitting in an upright position for 13 hours was not great. Food OK (not great). Tried to contact Ethiopian at the other end by email - no reply. Would rather pay a small amount extra and fly with a different airline. Unfortunately - I had already booked my return trip with them. Went online and bid for an upgrade. (Going to one of their offices I was quoted $1300. By bidding on line I got the upgrade for $800) Immediately the seat situation was great - until I want to recline. Guess what - it didn't work!!!!  They were able to recline it manually - but this was not what I expected. In a stop over in Dublin - someone actually came and fixed the problem (now that was a surprise) so the next 6 hours back to Toronto were great. The cabin staff did a great job in the upgrade but a terrible job in economy - call buttons generally ignored.

Also we've been caught twice with cancelled/rescheduled flights( to the following day) without notice to us before arriving to the airport (South Sudan and Madagascar)  This is truly unacceptable.   Beware that if you are traveling on a newly announced route that they don't seem to hesitate to cancel or change the flight to a different day...again without notice and without compensation for connecting flight issues.

"This is the worst airlines in the world. We were literally HARASSED in Ethiopia by the airlines crew and ground crew.

I have traveled in a lot of airlines and have never seen such bad ground service. First our flight from Mumbai was delayed by 6 hours but there was no communication on this.
As a result we missed our connection from Ethiopia and had to stay back in Ethiopia for a day.
When we landed in Ethiopia from Mumbai our luggage was missing. It took them another 3 to 4 hours to find the luggage. I went myself into the storage rooms and looked for the luggage.
Upon complaint of this there was no response from the ground staff. Next day when we went to catch our onward flight to Seychelles, we were HARASSED and threatened that we will be detained here as we do not have yellow cards. This was not asked from any other passengers as we all were on transit visa. (My guess is when we complained the previous day they had asked for our PNR number this was put into a system or something to reflect we needed to be troubled as there was another couple just in front of us who was let go with no questions asked)
Only when we threatened to call Indian Embassy and complaint about this were we let go but not before we had to sign a document which had a 5000 $ or something bond and said we are responsible if Seychelles decides to detain us.
We knew higher authorities in Seychelles and knew they will not trouble us as we did not leave the hotel the whole time we were in Ethiopia.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy111187,Andy wrote a review Aug 2018,Andy,,8 contributions,,Mumbai - Victoria,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r608927565-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst airlines ever.

The food (my vegetarian meal: rice with spinach) was bland and wet, I could not eat any of it. My sister's food (pasta with tomato sauce) gave her stomach pain. Overall the flight itself was not terrible, but the staff's lack of warmth impacted the experience.

Our flight back was better, our screens and seats worked. There was, however, a lack of organised seating arrangement, everything was last minute. Moreover, our departure was an hour late.

ADVICE : in order to stay hydrated do not expect the staff to offer beverages on a regular basis.

Airport staff lied to me about loading my luggage onto my flight. My luggage got lost, and when it did arrive in Johannesburg it was badly damaged. Ethiopian Airlines has refused to do anything about it, saying according to their records my luggage arrived in good order, even though airport staff made a note and signed the delivery invoice acknowledging my luggage was damaged.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BasheerahVWM,BasheerahVWM wrote a review Aug 2018,BasheerahVWM,"Johannesburg, South Africa",3 contributions,3 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Riyadh,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r608248971-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Do NOT fly with Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian have carved out a very successful market for travel around Africa and also from Africa onwards to the rest of the world at pretty reasonable prices. As a result the airline has grown fast and become the largest on the continent.

On the whole flying with Ethiopian is a pretty decent experience although the food is rather unexciting. They have a pretty good in flight entertainment movie choice and the staff are friendly enough. They have a large number of new planes which are well equipped but also some pretty old ones are still flying mostly within Africa which are rather less enjoyable to be in - but flying within Africa is rarely a huge pleasure.

Given their business model they have a huge transit operation at Bole Airport in Addis and the place seems to be crowded night and day with passengers moving around the world. However the airport itself although fairly new is pretty disorganised and unpleasant. In particular the toilets are pretty nasty and due to poor planning at the design stage of the airport, insufficient for the number of passengers using the main terminal so there are some 'temporary' toilets around as well which seem rather flimsy.

All passengers including transit passengers have to queue up for security check near the gate before boarding their flights after which at peak times causes large queues at the check points which are situated at either end of the departures lounge and also half way along and a further check point for premium passengers.

If the queue closest to your boarding gate is very long it is sometimes worth trying the a different point although the connecting door after security between the gates at one end of the terminal and those at the other can sometimes be closed (it seems to open and close quite randomly) in which case this plan won't work.

As many connections involve an overnight stay in Addis the airline provides complementary hotel accommodation in town and will provide a hotel voucher which also serves as a transit visa document. After passing through passport control (long queues) and customs the airline has a transit hotel desk where your voucher needs to be stamped and then you find you way to the transit minibus for your particular hotel outside the main entrance.

The hotels used are all pretty similar and basic but ok for a one night stop over. You will also get a free but simple meal at the hotel and breakfast if your flight is not early the next day (neither meal is really worth having unless you are very hungry).

Ethiopian is building its own huge transit hotel near the airport which may mean a slightly improved experience in the future although there seems to be a rather uninspiring consensus in Ethiopia on what a good hotel is like (boring and plain and a bit tatty).

If you have a Star Alliance Gold card (or something which looks like one) you can avoid the queues for immigration and security. The gold lounge for those with access is a break from the crowds and general chaos in the departure lounge which is full of tatty shops and a few places to eat. However on my last visit between clearing breakfast at 10 and putting out lunch at 12 there was nothing to eat which seemed rather strange. The lounge itself is rather uninspired but nicer than outside in terms of seating a toilets.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/0b/4c/70/pasm64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PASM64,PASM64 wrote a review Aug 2018,PASM64,"Harare, Zimbabwe",274 contributions,56 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r608007466-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The airline is fine but Bole airport is not much fun,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I experienced a very comfortable flight with this very prompt and professional airline.
The seats are wide and comfortable enough for economy class.
On our flight from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa, we had our own personal TVs with headsets with a fairly decent choice of movies, even though they were not necessarily the most recent blockbusters.
The flight from Addis to New Delhi did not provide personal TVs, but one has the option of connecting to the in-flight wifi and using the Ethiopian airline App for one's own entertainment. Since it was an overnight flight, I chose to preferably attempt to get some shut eye during this flight.
I also chose not to eat the airline food that was provided, which looked like the usual airline food.
The wine served, however, was of decent quality.
The air hostesses are friendly and efficient.
My only gripe with this airline would be the Addis Ababa Airport where all restaurants only accept USD and Euros in cash, with NO credit card facility!! Hence a much needed cup of coffee in transition is impossible should one not have either said currency.
The airport is also overcrowded with not many seats available to relax.
So if u don't have cash to spend at one of the restaurants to use as a relaxation area, be prepared to find yourself a space on the floor!
Nevertheless, I found the airline good value for money, with no major issues in-flight, whatsoever!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/26/2e/ca/67/maresag.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaresaG,Maresa G wrote a review Aug 2018,Maresa G,"Port Elizabeth, South Africa",907 contributions,105 helpful votes,Port Elizabeth - New Delhi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r607724798-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Truly Africa's best airline ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At the airport I was told that I had missed my flight the day before (the one that had been changed according to the airlines mail) so I was asked to pay penalty again. Exasperating!

"We were supposed to travel from Kigali to Toronto via one transfer at Addis Ababa on August 13, 2018.  Our flight on August 13 from Kigali was delayed for more than five hours due to various reasons (inefficient ground crew, inferior equipment such as broken chairs, etc.).  The ground crew at Kigali even lied to us regarding the status of our flight saying that it was on the way.  However after checking the flight status on flightradar24, it was confirmed that the plane had not even taken off Bujumbura.  In fact the plane was on Bujumbura for more than 2.5 hours prior to flying to Kigali.  Again in Kigali, it took them 1.5 hours to turn the plane around with only additional passengers.  The ground crew at Kigali was totally inefficient.Due to the extended delay, we missed our direct flight to Toronto, which left the gate approximately 30 minutes prior to our arrival at Addis.  We have been delayed before via other airlines, but most of the time, the airlines would hold the international flights to accommodate.  However this is not the case for Ethiopian Airlines, they simply do not care about their customers.  The transfer desk was a total chaos, because so many passengers missed their flights.  It was past midnight at that point.  We were eventually directed to take tomorrow flight to Toronto via Chicago O'Hare, as Ethiopian does not fly to Toronto on Tuesday.  We were told by the transfer agent that our luggage would accompany us to O'Hare.  We were provided with transit visa and hotel vouchers.  The trip to the hotel was exhausting.  The hotel reception at Hilton was terrible.  In the outset, the receptionist sent us to an inferior room filled with stale cigarette smoke, even the room was clearly marked non smoking.  He even insisted on charging us for internet because he said the hotel vouchers did not include the use of internet.  We were basically being penalized for missing our connection.  To no fault of our own, we needed to pay for internet to rework our work schedule.  After emailing to the VP customer service Mr. Yared, we are still waiting for the refund.After spending one very unproductive day in Addis, we finally arrived at Bole International Airport at around 7:30pm to check in our flight to O'Hare.  The check-in clerk at the counter again confirmed that the bags would be with us after glancing at the first luggage tag.  After arriving at O'Hare, we were told that we needed to collect our check-in luggage and clear US customs.  We waited more than 45 minutes, and our priority luggage was no where to be seen.  Anyway the ground crew at O'Hare told us that we had to report the missing bags once we landed at Toronto via Air Canada, their star alliance partner.  Dealing with Air Canada was a pleasure as compared to Ethiopian Airlines.  Anyway we have written to the VP as mentioned with copies to the CEO, we are still waiting for our lost luggage, reimbursement for out of pocket expense, and compensation for two days missed work.  We would not be holding our breath.  This would be the last time we fly Ethiopian Airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/31/27/ec/browniecool.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/browniecool,browniecool wrote a review Aug 2018,browniecool,"Toronto, Canada",15 contributions,9 helpful votes,Kigali - Toronto,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r607079283-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,My Worst Flying Experience,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian airlines is the worst flight company I ever experienced in my life, I do not even think it deserves to be called flight company ..NIGHTMARE COMPANY would be more appropriate as definition for them! My journey foresaw 2 stopovers, the first in Rome and as soon as I landed I learnt that the flight had been postoponed by 3 hours, that became 4, the aircraft made the passenger waiting before the take off for other 45minutes, no A/C on board before the take off and it was unbelivably hot. Due to this delay, I missed the flight I was expected to catch in Addis Abeba. I received the worst treatment ever at the Ethiopian desk in Addis Abeba, I explained that due to this delay I could not use the hotel already booked and paid in Johannesburg, and I needed a refund for this, since my arrival at the destination was expected to be on the 10th but due to the delay I would have arrived instead on the 11th. At the Ethiopian desk I was said that no refund would have been given to me. The aicraft transporting passengers from Addis Abeba to Johannesburg seemed to be very unsafe, the helic made a strong and creepy noise. Finally I landed safe and sound at destination and my flight expected to last 13h hours actually lasted 24hrs! Unbelievable..what is worst is that I got my luggage lost, I was able to have it returned only after 2 days but no assistance was given to me by the flight company, nor refund. Indeed it was the lost and found office in Johannesburg that assisted me and helped me to have the luggage returned. Now it is  5 days I am struggling to reach Ethiopian airlines by email, and even if I wrote at least 3 emails nobody never replied, I was said I was entitled to receive 75USD as refund and I am still waiting for somebody explaining me how to get the refund!!!

"The worst experience of my life. I have traveled to more than 14 countries with more than 10 airlines but none could beat the horrible experience of Ethiopia airline. The ordeal is not finished yet and I am still waiting at Addis Ababa to go to Dubai.
The problem started when flight at Blantyre was delayed by 3 hours. The worst, the booking clerk issued boarding pass till Addis Ababa and told me to collect boarding pass of dubai at Addis Ababa airport. I believed and it was my biggest mistake.
Now I came to Addis Ababa and after continuous follow up with the person concern i could not get boarding pass. They asked me to wait for some time and checked 80% passanger and then declared flight is full and next flight is in morning. It is to be noted that my flight was at 9.35 pm from Addis Ababa which got delayed to 1 am and after it was declared full, next flight announced was at 10.00 am in morning. There were around 25 passenger stranded without their fault infact it was fault of Ethiopian airlines. After a lot of fight, struggle and waiting at 3 am new ticket is issued and we are left at low class lounge at our mercy to wait till 9.45 pm ( promised to provide hotel but it is certain no such facility will be given because there are more than 500 people stranded for different flight because of overbooking and nobody is there to console or give appropriate reply.

"I first travelled with Ethiopian back in the ‘80s and while the planes they had at the time might not have been as fantastic as the 787 Dreamliner of 777, the food and service were both head and shoulders above where they are now.I just had a 2 flights on Ethiopian with the first being a 13hr flight and the food was absolutely atrocious!  I have never had worse airline food in my life.  What a disappointment when the food of the nation eat airline represents is so good. I think I may even have gotten sick from the food.  Sadly the service was not much better.  There were maybe 2 of the cabin stewards that were pleasant, whereas for the rest it seemed like an imposition to be there and to have to provide service to people.  We are paying for the service after all -  the travel is not free!Ethiopian, I would recommend that instead of just adding routes , you up your game and make Africa proud.

"The airline take passengers between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur before flying to Africa.
The reason I booked with Ethiopian Airline because of its perfect departure time in Singapore and return flight time in KL. And not forgetting the airlines using 787 instead of 737.
Unfortunately, both flights were delayed by 1.5hours. The worst is the airlines make passengers seated in the plane for an hour before taking off. No reason was given.
The return flight support arrival in Singapore at 1am but only arrived at 3.15am due to all kind of delay. And the air fare is not cheap actually.
Go for the airlines only if you are ready to accept the delay.

But alot people couldnt leave cause they have a lot of bags so most of us just started sitting on the floor and we waited for them.
When they came back with their so called manager we All thought we could leave early but she didnt Do anything but just stare at the line All the time. They tried rebooking but it took more than half an hour to rebook a person.
They basically didnt care cause only one Guy was on the Computer but the manager and the other Guy were just staring.
I got my flight rebooked at 8:45am so i stayed 8hours long in the Airport sitting on my bags.
I Would Never ever travel through Ethiopian Airlines again.

"This was my third flight on Ethiopian in 2018. I’ve always had tight change overs in Addis Ababa but the airline never missed a beat. Planes are quite new, service is good and the food is decent. The only downside is that the Muscat flight leaves from the Addis Ababa domestic terminal, and that was s few notches below the international terminal in terms of facilities and  staff. Overall I enjoyed the experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NielB34,Niel B wrote a review Aug 2018,Niel B,,27 contributions,5 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Muscat Governorate,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r605718554-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Consistently satisfactory,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'd just had 6 flights with Ethiopian during a 2-week vacations. It's all pretty good once you're airborne but that's all.

Good things first: pitch seems very decent and the in-flight entertainment system is quite good, more so in the B-787 Dreamliner. On half of those flights, however, (aboard the 777-200/300) the touch function wasn't working and I had to work my way with the armrest console. Food is pretty good for airline standards and service is also good.

The operation at Addis Ababa, on the other hand, is a complete disgrace. And it doesn't help that the airport has some serious issues on it's on, like the lack of places to eat (and those that exists weren't accepting credit cards the three times we where there), the precarious toilets and the sheer volume of people laying around everywhere.

On our way back to Addis from Cape Town my wife's luggage had the lock completely busted, to the point it damaged the zipper. Company personnel took forever to address the issue and kept saying that it was a minor damage and they wouldn't do anything. And that, sadly, was the least unpleasant surprise.

About 2 days before our departure from Addis, Ethiopian Airlines sent us an email stating that our flight has changed from Saturday night to Sunday early morning, no explanations given whatsoever. Since Addis lacks Wi-Fi coverage in most places, even some hotels, we only saw the email on the morning of our flight. There began our odyssey

We called the company's hotline to ask what happened and what would the company do, since we didn't have an overnight booking at any hotel as we were planning to return from a tour outside Addis straight to the airport. The sole answer: they wouldn't do a thing, since it wasn't a connecting flight (?!?!).

Our tour guide then drove us to one of their offices, where we were told to be at the airport at the original check-in time and the company would ""for sure"" give us accommodation for the night.

When we finally arrived at Bole airport we asked for the customer service personnel and the first lady who talked to us said we should go to Arrivals to get our voucher, without any more explanations. We then talked to a supervisor who said we should check-in and drop the luggage while he would get us the hotel vouchers.

In the meantime we found another traveller with the same problem but who hasn't received any email and he told us he was instructed to wait at the gate (mind you, by then we were talking about a 7-hours delay in a airport with little to none infrastructure).

The three of us stood there for a good 15-20 minutes while the supervisor disappeared never to be seen again. When we asked to talk to the senior officer in charge things only went sour. He was completely unprepared for the job: yelled at my wife, behave like a spoiled baby sitting in one of the chairs and saying he wouldn't leave there and even laughed when I asked what was the reason for the flight delay, reminding him it's a written company's policy to ""explain the reason of the delay"". After over 1 hour of discussions we finally got our hotel vouchers, but no meal (and as we had to be at the airport again at 5:30 am, the hotel couldn't serve us breakfast). By then we were so stressed out and tired than we could only hope to get a few hours of sleep and a nice shower.

The following morning, when we arrived at the airport, the flight was already delayed another 40 minutes and, again, no explanations given. The boarding gate was kept closed (like most of the airport) at least until half an hour before our departure time (and way after the boarding time) and there was absolutely no one there to give any instructions. We finally managed to use another gate and had to found our way into the correct one.

Once on board the only mention to a now more than 8-hours delay was the flight attendant saying sorry for it, without any more details.

Curious enough, there was no information whatsoever on Ethiopian's website about the flight or the delay, and also no info at other websites like FlightAware or Flight Radar. I'm guessing they changed the flight number to cover for the delay so it wouldn't damage their statistics.

Bottom line: although the flight experience is quite good, the ground operation and the customer support ruins everything.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/7a/3e/c5/brunosrc.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunoSRC,BrunoSRC wrote a review Aug 2018,BrunoSRC,"Singapore, Singapore",125 contributions,50 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Singapore,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r605697657-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Worst airline ever, serious damage to Star Alliance",,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dar-Addis-Bangkok on 8th August 2018. Checked in online after some difficulties, but was allowed to transit 7 hours prior to departure. Granted 3rd part lounge in Dar is Tanzanite which always gives me problems when entering. Always greedy after money and this time they wanted to charge me 35 USD because I was “2 hours early”. This, despite I had Lounge Invitation printed on my BPs. I had to call ET-manager to access. The lounge is so, so, but they have plenty hot snacks and drinks. Aircraft B787-900 on 1st leg was downgraded to a smaller B737 due to low load in economy. However, that caused 3 biz-passengers to be downgraded. Without being requested, I volunteered to do so and got 250 USD in ET-vouchers as compensation. The check-in staff came to the lounge and were relieved by my decision. I was fine as I still had my special meal and lounge access. I was treated like a king to Addis: despite travelling economy I almost felt ashamed getting champagne and foods from bz-class brought down discretely to row 17.  I even got my special meal (red-snapper) but had to additional dishes, veal and beef, all very tasty. Got the menu from business could choose food and drinks from there. Only downturn was the plastic cutlery.  They gave me 3 seats for myself despite economy became 75% full. Cloud Nine Lounge in Addis was OK but no showers neither there not in any other lounge in Addis. Tried to cash my vouchers but failed. Both flights almost on time. The 2nd leg on B787-800 was in 2-2-2 configuration in Biz, which is quite cramped compared to Qatar´s much more spacious 1-2-1. That trip was smooth and punctual.

"Although our boarding pass showed our seat assignments as  11 J, L for our flight from Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro, when we tried to board, we were told without any further explanation that our seats had been reassigned.  They sent us to another agent who then reassigned us to two seats in Row 24.  .  When we booked our flight at least 8 months ago, we literally were the first people to select our economy seats and we chose 11 J, L because I am 6’4” tall and these seats would provide me the best available leg room, plus it placed us next to the exit row so that we would be at the head of the line for visa and passport processing.  Sitting in row 24 was completely inferior in both regards.The Ethiopian Air staff did not offer any apology until I protested and wanted to know why the change was being made.  They only said that the change was necessary due to a last-minute change in aircraft.  I knew this to be a lie because, I had found that my wife’s seat assignment had been removed at least a week prior.  After checking with Ethiopian Air and our agent with Holbrook Travel, I was assured me that our seat assignments were fineAfter I protested, they allowed me to move from my Row 11 aisle assignment to my wife’s window assignment, but they still reassigned my wife to row 24, which slowed her when she deplaned.  Instead of being at the head of the lines for visa and passports, we stood in lines for over two hours, forcing other Road Scholar passengers and our tour guide to wait on us for over 1.5 hours.After talking with the passenger who was then assigned to my wife’s seat, it became clear that Business Class had been overbooked, he had lost his Business Class seat and was given my wife’s seat as compensation.  My wife and I travel extensively  and we have never before received such poor and unprofessional service from any airline.  The unapologetic behavior of the staff, their attempt to lie telling me this was a very last minute change, not disclosing this problem to us until the very moment we were to board the plane, , and the fact that they considered my wife to be “less deserving” of her seat assignment than someone who had been moved from Business Class were all totally unacceptable actions, each of which should have been handled in a much different and more professional manner.  Because it was not, my wife and I were placed in a very embarrassing and humiliating situation that was entirely avoidable.   We had other options for our travel on this trip, but we chose Ethiopian Air on the  recommendation of our travel agent.

"We actually fly Ethiopian Airlines a fair amount. We like them a lot. Their service is good, flight attendants friendly, and aircraft pretty good.  When leaving from Addis they have the ""seat zone"" loading approach figured out pretty well. They load from the back of the plane and it works well.  When flights originate in other cities, it's a bit dicier approach. This week, we flew from Joburg back to Addis. When it comes time to load, they ask all the passengers to leave the boarding area and file back out to the hallway.  They then, using no microphone or public address system, ask passengers to board by rows (i.e., rows 30 and higher, rows 20 and higher, rows 15 and higher, etc.). They don't make friends with this approach. People are crabby to get up and leave their seats in the waiting area, and they are angry when they can't hear. It would be much better if they just rope off the boarding area until they are ready to load the plane, and also if they would use a microphone to help load the plane.  These would be small changes, but would reduce folks' anxiety during the waiting and boarding process.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/5b/3f/cb/africanaddict.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/africanaddict,africanaddict wrote a review Aug 2018,africanaddict,"Kigali, Rwanda",605 contributions,206 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r604836100-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Great airline once you're in the air,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We availed this flight to travel from Mumbai to Tanzania.
Unfortunately this is not a very professional airline. Since we made our booking the airline changed their departure schedule 3 times. Luckily we were on their connecting flight from Addis Ababa onwards, but imagine the plight of other passengers who have connecting flight on other airlines to different destinations.
The planes are comparatively new and so comfortable. But there was a big issue with blankets and pillows. One had to literally run after the air hostess to get one. Quite a few went without it.
After a sleepless night at the airport we left at 4.00 hrs IST(on time) . Everyone quickly tried to get a wink of sleep. But the airline continued to keep the lights on and god knows after how much time started serving the meal. I did not have any as it was no time to have a meal.
Before we landed at Addis Ababa at 7.00 hrs local time, I asked for a cup of tea. I was told that there was no service.
After landing at Addis Ababa airport we had three hours to connect our next flight.
Experience at the airport was terrible. There was no place to sit. People were sleeping using more than one seat. People were sprawled all over the floor and the toilets were packed and dirty.
Even crossing from one terminal to the other was a nightmare.
We found no water to drink. Someone pointed towards a restaurant to buy a bottle.

"I’m a pretty easy going traveler. I don’t mind sleeping at airports, waiting around for hours at a time - if I’ve booked to do so (usually to save money...) but I depend on clear communication from companies with whom I’m traveling - especially when there’s a connecting flight involved.
I arrived to the airport at 3:30PM for a 7:15 take off time with Ethiopian Airlines to Frankfurt via Addis Ababa. I was brought into the office and told (not asked) that I was being transferred to a slightly earlier flight. With a new 5:50PM boarding time I waited and waited until it was 6:30 and no plane was in sight. Turns out, me and 70 other passengers who had arrived early were bumped out of our schedule flight because it was overbooked. We then were stranded without ANY communication from Ethiopian Airlines (not even a courtesy announcement).

"Instead of a 3 hour direct flight that we had paid for, the airline without explanation did a layover in Nairobi where half of the passengers got off (that was their final destination) and the other half were not given an explanation why their direct flight was now via Kenya! The only explanation I can think of is due to their low occupancy rate for obvious reasons they combined the two flights and made the folks heading to seychelles suffer! We got their 4 hours after scheduled time.

"I was very disappointed with the experience at Bole International Airport. The flight got in quite some time after the scheduled time having departed late from Accra. We landed ten minutes before my connecting flight. I brought this to attention of the flight attendants who were similarly concerned and immediately informed ground staff to assist me.

The ground staff, however, could not be bothered. They made no special arrangements to aid me to make my fight. I had to board the same bus as everyone else and wait for it to fill up. When we got to the terminal, rather than provide a cart the staff demanded that I run the length of the airport to make the flight. Bearing in mind my weight and age as well as the airline's culpability in the situation I refused. After some brisk walking I got to the Cloud9 boarding gate with four minutes to go.

All that effort only to be told the gate was closed. Again, I was told to run to the general boarding gate. Again I refused. After some rude comments the staff determined that the sensible action was to radio ahead and accompany me to the gate. Upon arrival, I had to wait almost an hour before a bus was dispatched to take a number of passengers and I to the aircraft. Apparently, my earlier flight wasn't the only one delayed. After boarding we waited a further half hour for a second busload before taking off.

The aircraft was in poor condition. The interior was old and not particularly clean. The seats were uncomfortable and some functions do not work. Inflight entertainment was poor as there was no variety. Surely, Ethiopian can do better on such a busy route. At the very least the cabin can be refurbished or the seats changed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iyamson,iyamson wrote a review Aug 2018,iyamson,,14 contributions,25 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Entebbe,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r602737635-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Please Make This A Better Experience,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of service provided by Ethiopian Air on the Accra route. The aircraft is new and comfortable though I struggle somewhat with the space for feet when lounging or lying flat.

Service on board was good when given but I noticed it takes the pursers quite a while to respond when the call button is pushed. On this occasion if took about fifteen minutes and pushing the call button at least three times to either be noticed or for the staff to decide to attend to me.

"This was my first time using the airline. I now know why the flights are cheap. First of all the queues for departure were so long. Finally got to Addis Ababa and the airport was so stuffy. They were undergoing renovations so that could be the reason.

Return flight was the worst. Check in was another nightmare. First of all was having issues getting my boarding passes. Check in was self service. Another long queue. When I finally got to the gate it was already time to board the plane. We didn’t take off until one and a half hour later. Thanks to this delay I missed my connection flight. As the flights were mostly booked the next flight was in 7 hours. They gave me breakfast and lunch vouchers which were a waste. The food was bland. Hardly any variety. Basically served the same thing for both breakfast and lunch.

"My trip started in a very unsual way, when arriving to airport, discovered that my ticket was sold from Yaounde, but my flight was in reality from Douala! After the situation was cleared, Ethiopian got me a private airplane to reach Douala on time (I am sure it happened this way, because my ticket was first class...). To be honest I was a bit suspicious about the company, but after being very well cared in the company private lounge and all my belongings taken care, and boarding the brand new Boeing Dreamliner in Douala I felt very relaxed, the front cabin is extremely comfortable, the champagne and food, including some exotic Ethiopian delicacies was superb, music selection had a refreshing approach to world music, arrival in Adis Ababa, hotel transfers to and back airport where very good also.

"First let me tell you that my partner and I live in Malta, which means we have to take a flight to another city with a bigger airport for international flights.

We usually fly with Turkish Airlines when it comes to exotic destinations such as Maldives, Seychelles, Bali, etc. - which has only 1 stop in Istanbul and voila! Why didn't we fly with TA this time? Simple: we wanted to book a roundtrip ticket and the day we were returning back from Seychelles TA was not flying.

As we were already spending 17 days in Seychelles, we were not interested in booking 2 more nights in order to fly with TA.

Another side note with TA was (apart of the usual rudeness of the staff both in the plane and in the lounges) the big layover of 10 hours from/to Istanbul/Seychelles!

The other solution was flying to Rome and then fly with Ethiopian Airline who had a late flight at 11 PM to Addis Ababa and a shorter layover of 4 hours before heading to Seychelles, for quite a cheap price: €250 p.p including 2 big bags of 30Kg per person for Economy!

However Ethiopian would mean an airline from... Ethiopia! I mean, we were pretty scared! What if they loose our luggage? What if they have delays, what if the food or staff are terrible? How is the airport? While I googled to gather the maximum info about Ethiopian Airline, I must say the reviews were pretty scary!

After ponderation, we decided to give it a try as we like to make our own opinions nevertheless and we booked it literally 2-3 days before our departure!

Here are the positive points by flying Ethiopian:

1. Pre-ordered Meals: my partner and I are both Vegans so we had to call during the weekend to order our vegan meals for all the 4 flights as our first flight was Monday at 11 PM.

Even during weekends they took our order and delivered it! With TA or literally any other airline, they would never make it possible because we ordered during a Saturday or Sunday and it has to be ordered 24h to 48h week-days before!

We had vegan meals in all the 4 flights and it was pretty good! We were even served first!

2. You can bring 2 check-in bags of 30Kg per person in Economy! I mean this is pretty cool!

3. The ladies serving us in the plane were actually pretty helpful if you talk politely and with a smile.

4. Price! The price of €250 p.p to Seychelles was incredible! With TA we would have paid €400 from Rome and €800 from Malta p.p!

Now the bad points or the ""why it was so cheap"":

1. You have to pay extra to reserve your seat: so we wanted to be sure we will be next to each other and on a window side (where there are only 3 seats) instead of the middle row which has 4 seats. It was 20euros per flight (€10 each) so €80 just for the seats.

2. The interior of the planes do look a bit old and they don't have much leg space, my partner is quite tall so it was a bit more stressful for him than for me.

3. The worst negative point of the journey is for sure the Addis Ababa Airport: oh boy!
This is really once you land there that you understand why it was such a cheap flight! The experience is beyond terrible and stressful. The airport looks totally improvised and built in an old factory, the WC is well... a challenge!

4. Terrible Airport facilities and Security: There are no lounges except the one from Ethiopian Airline, no proper restaurants not even a Starbucks! Wifi has to be purchased otherwise it simply doesn't work! And you have to pass thru security and remove your shoes even if you are on flip-flops and walk on the floor barefoot! Just disgusting!

5. Lost our luggage: This is where I was really the most afraid of! Ethiopian managed to keep our luggage on Addis Ababa Airport even after double checking with them to be sure our checked-in bags (with final destination Seychelles) were on the plane to Seychelles. On a 4 hours layover this is inadmissible! They manage to deliver the luggage 24 hours after our arrival in Seychelles directly to our hotel and nothing was stolen so ultimately the problem got solved.

6. Over 60 minutes delay to take off from Addis Ababa: We were in the plane but we had to wait for our turn to take off and this took 60 minutes.

Overall, I gave 3 stars because we did 4 flights with them safely and nothing happened to us; despite the fact our luggage took 24 hours to arrive, they were not damaged and nothing was stolen; the vegan food on the plane was really good; staff was helpful.

I'm not sure if I would fly with them again as the layover in Addis Ababa was nevertheless quite a stressful and a tiring experience due to the very poor conditions of the airport.

In very exceptional cases I would recommend flying with them:
1. If the price is like half of the competition and the layover is short (no more than 4-5 hours); and 2. you book your seats before.

Hope it was helpful for all!

Best,

"Leaving Cape Town after a wonderful family vacation which we decide to extend at what we thought a reasonable fare price which to our surprise later had doubled. The call Centre gave us a quote which we then decided it’s not much, worked out our budgets for the extra weeks stay and grand we decided to extend. He told me my transaction could not be done at that time bt no problem we could pay before we fly out at the airport. MUCH TO OUR SHOCK AND HORROR we were charged DOUBLE the quote with a non negotiation attitude just, you should have paid for the ticket change on the day and that we can go to the offices bt they closed so either pay or stay.
Next was the check in counter.. WHAT an appalling human interaction with Samantha Faru the worst attendant I’ve ever encountered, she was doing us a huge favor by honoring our request to select seats sitting together, she ripped up the first batch as we asked if we can select seats as we have asked her colleague before we were told our flight has not been finalized yet. She was the rudest person in this industry I have ever encountered, her manager on duty no better. She of course did not bother changing our connecting flight tickets because we did not ask for both so we sat in different seats for 5 hours home on the smallest plane.

"While trying hard to be a world class airline, compared to the services of the major carriers plying intercontinental routes, ET  still falls short of its claim to be Africa's best carrier. The service both onboard and on the ground was disappointing. Boarding was disorganized even at Toronto where the queue meant for business class also had people from economy, later to be told we had to go first to another counter to get our documents checked. There was no sign that you had to go to that counter first before queuing up.  Agents were unsmiling and looked harassed.Once on board, cabin crew took my order for a Western meal but once they came out with the wheeled tray of food, they ladled out the national dish which was very spicy. Meat was tough and overcooked. No ice cream. Dessert was unimaginative and cheese platter  did not look fresh.  At least the plane was a new dreamliner and had a wide array of movies. I took business class as I was on a business class trip to Mozambique and had 22 hours of travel time. I was looking forward to some respite on the ground but the lounges in Addis Ababa were crammed with transit passengers and did not offer a relaxing atmosphere. Cloud 9 Lounge facilities and food was also very limited and also disappointing. No shower facilities. Difficult to find a place to sit. Didn't eat there as a result. Cannot compare with Qatar or Emirates or even those of European carriers.

"Using United mileage to fly to Chicago, USA, i booked a flight with Ethiopian. There is a stop of 7.5 hours in Addis Abeba.
While checking in at Tel Aviv, the nice Ground attendant offered a voucher for free tour and dinner ןin Addis.
Right as we stepped out of the airplane, Ethiopian representative was waiting for us. The whole staying in Addis was very organized, we had a nice tour, great authentic dinner, and back on time to the airport.
Thank you Ethiopian Airlines, you made the difference between frustrating 7 hours stop in an airport, and an additional great experience with added value to the flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dror_solomon,dror_solomon wrote a review Jul 2018,dror_solomon,,9 contributions,3 helpful votes,Tel Aviv - Chicago,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r601654845-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Extra bonus with Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight from Newark to Addis was more than two hours late arriving.  We missed our connections, on Ethiopian, to our next destination, Lusaka.  There were at least a dozen people on that flight in the same boat.  We were put up in a reasonable hotel.  Our family members, who were flying economy, were put up in a place with electrical wires hanging down, dirty bathrooms, and where our grandson was severely bitten by a spider.  We would have had them stay with us, but the Ethiopian Airlines representative insisted that their hotel was a nice place.  Our flight out the next day caused us to miss another set of connections.  Looks like Ethiopian Airlines has low priority status at busy airports.Our return trips were much them same but relatively on time.Our flight crews varied from reasonably competent and pleasant to down-right nasty.Special ordered meals for members of our party with severe dietary restrictions and confirmed multiple times on EA's website showed up for only two of the meals.  Three flight crews just shrugged and blew it off.  Two others tried to be helpful.Planes are relatively new but not well-maintained inside.  Hopefully this is not a reflection of maintenance in more critical areas.Economy class seats were beyond uncomfortable.

"The airline was the cheapest so i was a bit worried prior to the flights on the quality of the planes as maybe being old. the flight onboarding was delayed and then there was a run to the plane via customs, not sure if this was the airport or airplane problem. To my pleasant surprise, the plane was a new Boeing 777. the greatest part of Ethiopian Airlines planes was the double reclining seats which makes it easier to sleep or rest on a plane.

"Hi

Flew from London Heathrow to Lilongwe (Malawi) via Addis Ababa.
The flight from Heathrow was great, was on a brand new Airbus A350, you hardly knew that you were flying and very comfortable, service was average, food and drink was average as well, I have had better service with some of Ethiopian rivals like Etihad and Qatar. the entertainment was poor as well.But Ethiopian couldn't be beat on prce.

Addis Ababa - Old, Chaotic,battered, busy, no organisation, staff rude, Toilets are a disgrace, they are cubicles like you get at a building site or music festival.

Flight from Addis Ababa to Lilongwe & back to Addis Ababa was on a much older plane Boeing 737-800, legroom was tight and cramped. No entertaiment just some drop down TV through out the cabin with a film on. Service was a little better and food was better as well.

Flight back to London was just the same as going apart from late leaving Addis Ababa by an hour.

Would fly again with Ethiopian with out question, because of the price of a ticket.

"The Airline seems to have an overwhelming number of unskilled workers with a few that actually know what they are doing and why they are getting paid.
On our inbound trip I was shocked that we could be saved the same style of Rice and Chicken cooked in tomato gravy for a 20hour flight with delays of course to USA and when we asked the attendant she says she’d give us a form so we can place our complaint for been fed the same dish and snack 6times on the flight.
On the outbound flight we tried to enquire on carrying of puppies and they are clueless literally reading off what’s on their site like robots with no exception.
Finally was told to contact an agent but Ethopian Airlines will charge us as clients.Thats after cargo section even hang on me rudely by saying they have technical difficulties and the gentleman couldn’t even let me finish my words.
6years ago we used this Airline and they messed up the accommodation reservation with their Bole ambassador hotel for my husband and he ended up sleeping on the bench as the connection time was more than 24hours!
Regardless of planning and paying just to be told he had no visa but why would you accept money.
We thought after 6years things would change but clearly these people have it jumbled up.
Such Airlines shouldn’t be allowed Internationally let them stick to flying locally in their country as they put a bad name on Flight service.
I can never recommend to fly with this Airline it’s better you spend a bit more on other Airlines which actually have your moneys worth.

"Regarding services e.g. food, staff care, luggage weight limit, flight time, punctuality, seat space, flight attendance service, they are quite excellent. But it is skeptical that my reservation conditions say I can change flight schedule without additional fee.
In fact I was robbed in Johannesburg on July 7, 2018, and wanted to return to my home in Bangkok earlier than predetermined schedules. My sister and my son in Bangkok told me that the airliner demanded about USD 260 to change the flight. I visited the airliner in OR Tambo International Airport and they said the same. I got confused and declined to have my flight time change.
I also met 3 Thai and American persons on flights from Bangkok to Addis Ababa and from Addis Ababa to Johannesburg on July 2, 2018. They saved me by driving and riding me from the Airport to my hotel in the suburb of Pretoria before their arrival in the Kruger National Park. I did not note the 3 persons’ name and address to express gratitude that I was not robbed on July 2 night. I asked the airliner to give me names as well as contact addresses of phone of these good mind persons but the airliner never replies on both the additional fee and the addresses.

"This is my first time flying Ethiopian Airlines, and I was not sure what to expect...  I was quite pleased with the results!  The service was extremely friendly.  The food was a little different, but good - they served us both breakfast and lunch.  The seats were a little run-down.  We had great on-board entertainment.  Although it was a very long flight, the time flew by (pun intended!).  We were a little surprised about the level of security.

"Soon after boarding, it was announced that the plane would be making a stop somewhere to ""refuel"". This is a flight from Kilimanjaro to Addis Ababa - why would the plane need to refuel for that? Anyway, I wasn't bothered because I know there are MULTIPLE internation airports enroute. However, they took us to Kigali, Rwanda, which is in an entirely different direction than where we needed to go. When we got there, they onboarded tons of people, and I quickly realized this stop wasn't to refuel, it was just to pick people up. The whole ordeal took an extra 2-3 hours, so I missed my layover in Addis Ababa.

It was about 11 PM when we landed. I went to the customer service desk to ask them to find me a new flight, and they tried to tell me that it wasn't their fault. How was this not their fault that they made an unplanned stop for more customers?? I had to fight for over an hour just to get them to start trying to help me. Finally, around 2 AM I had a new flight and a hotel voucher.

They told me they would reroute my bags, too, and I watched how the guy did it - he sent an email out to ALL airport staff saying something along the lines of ""please put these bags onto this flight..."". So it was no surprise when my bags didn't make it onto my new flight. The technology and processes they use are completely outdated. I was shocked that they were using email for this process. Their process looking for flights was also much more complicated due to their technology. They had no way to IM eachother, so they resort to phone calls, but its so noisy that they can barely hear one another. I almost wanted to pitch some new tech solutions to them, but I was too annoyed.

I will try with all my might to avoid ever having to take a flight with Ethiopian Airlines again. However, if anyone from Ethiopian Airlines wants to talk to me about updating their processes and systems, I'd be happy to offer my ideas.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderingGalKK,WanderingGalKK wrote a review Jul 2018,WanderingGalKK,"Dallas, Texas",24 contributions,5 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Addis Ababa,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r599332843-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Horrible airline - unexpected layovers to pick up more passengers, terrible customer service",Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Checking in went smooth. The airport was a carnage of people with nowhere to stand or sit. The restaurants reminded me of Temple Street Market restaurants in Hong Kong where customers are hassled in. To begin with there was only one highly demotivated #Ethiopian @flyethiopian staff to check gate passes and load customers to the bus that took us in the rain to the tarmac and stairs. There was no #Ethiopian @flyethiopian ground staff to be seen so we had to push and shav our way up the staircase to the plane. The flight left late and arrived 1.5hrs late to Manila. The #Ethiopian @flyethiopian flight crew seemed undertrained, lacking of basic hospitality skills sometimes boarderlining rude more so during the inbound flight to Addis.  I was shocked to witness #Ethiopian @flyethiopian crew berating non-Amharic speaking customers in Amharic in front of them and making rather crass remarks.  The #Ethiopian @flyethiopian crew also lacked basic courtesy skills. I was shocked to see none of the crew smile with exception to one that was polite and accommodating. I think #Ethiopian @flyethiopian needs to take a good and hard look at its services quality levels both airport and cabin before claiming to be ‘the new spirit of Africa”.

"I recently flew Ethiopian Airlines from Hong Kong to Addis and Addis to Manila. I highly commend #Ethiopian @flyethiopian for its easily accessible online checking system and once ability to confirm seats.

The #Ethiopian @flyethiopian flight which was supposed to depart at 11:50pm on 7 July left  on 8 July at 12:35am and arrived early at 4:35am instead of 5:10am. Once again, early is better than late if it was not freezing cold and pouring down rain not to mention the airport was not prepared for the arrivals.

"My husband pays full fare for a Business Class ticket on Ethiopian Airlines to Copenhagen. Coming home, he gets bumped off both the morning and the afternoon flights because they have overbooked! Finally he gets shoehorned into an Economy Class seat and makes it home. No compensation, no apology, nada! His meal? Polony on stale bun that bears a strong resemblance to a plumber's crack! I say it's a poor show for 'Africa's Best Carrier'. Of what? Listeria? Nobody answers phone at their JHB office. It's over a week later and still Ethiopian Airlines has not offered him one cent in compensation!

"Wasn’t sure what to expect from “Africa’s best airline” but they did not disappoint!   We were a little apprehensive given the first flight would be 18 hours connecting through Ethiopia, and the second flight another 6 hours to South Africa. That’s a long time to rely on the comfort and service of an unknown product but I give them fully credit! First, they’re flying brand new well maintained aircraft. Our business class seats were full lie flat beds on every leg, with pillows and blankets as well as amenity kits provided on each as well. Amenity kits included socks, eye mask, toothbrush, hairbrush, chapstick and a pen for filling out your landing forms.   They were also great with the service carts, coming around regularly. In fact all told we had 6 meals on board, and each was an assortment of enough western and African foods to carefully feed everyone.  Additionally the business class meals had a first, second and desert course an constant drink pours so there was no chance of getting that mid-air hunger and not knowing if/when you’d be able to eat.  I also give them great credit for serving the breakfast/lunch/dinner foods in accordance with the time of arrival - which helped force us onto Africa time and skirt jet lag which was a big concern with a 32 hour travel time.   The planes also had the all important cabin mood lighting so they were able to gently force you into local time by recreating the correct level of light for where you were going.  It was impressive actually how incredibly comfortable and well taken care of we were.  If I need to spend a day and a half in 6 square feet I wouldn’t hesitate to do it with Ethiopian again! Only note of warning they did consistently run late at every leg. It was never a concern for us as our entire itinerary was on one ticket with them so we weren’t in danger of missing anything but if you were booking different connectors with other airlines I would buffer at least 2-3 hours into your transfers to be safe.  our departure which was set to leave LA at 00:30 didn’t even start boarding until well after meaning our ADD landing scheduled for 4 am actually got in after 6am.  Worth it for the super discount business ticket on one of the best planes I’ve been on.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/c7/1b/93/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloctopusco,TravelOctopusCo wrote a review Jul 2018,TravelOctopusCo,"Los Angeles, California",779 contributions,312 helpful votes,Los Angeles - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r598703116-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Great Airline for a Long Haul ,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I didnt want to write a review of this flight but I just cant help it. I flew with ethiopian before, never complained, got decently good food and okay service. But on my return flight from cape town to stockholm we had a between landing in Ethiopia and let me tell you, it wasnt good. I dont want to talk badly on the airline by dissing the airport but since it is their main hub and base it is their responsibility. When we landed after our 6 and a half hour flight we were directed towards the terminal. We ended up outside of security again even though it was only around 2 hours untill our next flight but we didnt mind that. Not untill we got to go through security which asked every person to put off their shoes.Also they let the girl in front of us (who was ethiopian) let go through with a manicure scissors? And then when we thought we were done as well this worker reaches into our small see through plastic bag and takes lighter which my partner colects (and is approved to have all over the world and never had problem before, obviously had it on the last flight as well) and doesnt say a word. I try to ask him what he is doing taking things without letting us know and he just shushed us away leaving us very disstressed.

After finding our gate which we werent actually sure because the signs werent clear, our flight was late, we didnt know how long. We sat in this big room full of people, it was warm, it looked dirty and it smelled very badly in there. I would compare it to a big barn and expected to see some goats go by soon.

When we were going to finally board the bus to get to our plane, without any reason my partner got her ticket changed and was sat somewhere completely different without explanation even when the seats were pre booked. We trued to talk to them bu again were ignored and sent away and for 7 and a half hour flight we did wanted to sit together. Thankfully the flight wasnt full and we got to sit together anyway.

After all of this, we were happy sitting in a new boeing 787, sattisfied we will finally get home after this horrible travel day but, when we got home we both
apparently got food poisoning so, not so good after all and ended up staying home another 3 days from work.

I dont know why this last leg of our journey was so bad but i got so dissapointed i am very sure we wont be travelling with ethiopian and definitely not to ethiopia itself anytime soon.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/ad/e1/b5/external-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misjankuk,misjankuk wrote a review Jul 2018,misjankuk,"Stockholm, Sweden",5 contributions,5 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Stockholm,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r598504010-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Horrible experience,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have always had a great service from Ethiopian airlines and the most supportive and positive interaction with their staff. However, they own half of Malawian airlines and they have been absolutely appalling. The staff at the airport working for Ethiopian airlines refused to support us whatsoever when we were stuck with an overbooked flight and left passengers clueless, without water and stood in a queue for 8 hours with no information. The airline took our baggage knowing the flight was full and proceeded to lose baggage and assumed they had sent on a flight somewhere. Thus breaching security and breaking policy. Absolutely disgusted. Staff were rude, unhelpful and completely disrespectful. As a British traveler I will be making sure that everyone I know or come into contact with never uses Malawian airlines and knows how completely disorganized, disrespectful and incompetent they are.

"After waiting 4 hours on the tarmac (we kept being told we will know more in 1/2 an hour and then heard nothing for over an hour) they told us it was cancelled. They then served us supper (I assume so they didn’t have to give us meal vouchers) but all we wanted at 1am was to find somewhere to sleep. When we got off the airport was closed, they said there were no hotels available but when we went on booking.com we found space immediately. When we checked in the hotel told us they had not heard from Ethiopian airlines. The hotel was approximately 5mins away by cab. Definitely within 25 miles. Some people did not have the funds or knowledge to do this and had to sleep as best they could at the airport. There was no one to tell us what was going to happen other than to come back at 17.00 but what were we meant to do from 1am - 17.00. Their customer service line just rang and rang and I was put on hold for 1 hour. When someone finally answered I had been redirected to Ethiopia and the person on the other end could not help me. We are traveling to Botswana and the next direct flight from Addis to Gaborone is in 2 days time. I have been told they will fly us to Johannesburg and then gabs but have no idea when the flights are or when we can expect to finally get to Gaborone. I am concerned that if I get on the flight this evening once I am in Addis I will be at their mercy as to when and how they get me to my destination. I understand that things happen my reason for giving a bad score is that they have consistently let their passengers down from not keeping us informed of their issues on the tarmac, not finding accommodation for us, not having anyone to let us know what is happening, leaving us for close to 24hrs with no point of contact.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic636996,Scenic636996 wrote a review Jul 2018,Scenic636996,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,London - Gaborone,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r598417346-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Never Again,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I took two connecting flights with Ethiopian airlines Entebbe, Uganda to Adis Ababa, the AA to Frankfurt Business class. The crew were very friendly on both flights, attentive and bent over backwards to accomodate any small requests; yes I know it’s business class and that what they do, this went beyond that.

The food was local food, although with a mixture of very spiced to mild which was a bonus for those without well developed taste buds. The drink selection was very good, with nothing being too much for any of the staff, from a coffee right through to hard liquor.

For me the highIight was the seat the folded completely flat; the Business pod that you stay in was similar to that of Emirates, you can see what this airline is trying to model themselves around. The seat was comfortable to sleep in, although an extra blanket would have gone down well.

Climate control that didn't seem to work properly. Now a total of 5 international flights of theirs that were delayed ! Add to the rudeness of the staff at the airport. Faulty entertainment system. Old and dated planes. Complete lack of interest from staff to make any effort with passengers. Allowing some passengers free will to have their kids running around and affecting entire sections of passengers without any management or effort from staff to contain the situation.

"So having Travelled over the last 23 years as an adult, on over 11 different international carriers, this has been by far the worst overall experience. Now one can allow for one or two things to be off or on a single flight. However it was consistantly terrible! Of the 3 flights on this journey, 2 of the 3 were delayed. The staff at Addis Ababa were unhelpful and rude. The aircraft itself in poor condition. Their menu is awful, plane food is generally nothing to write home about but it was so bad that we got our own food to eat on the plane. Their drinks list also incredibly bad. Not even house spirits or even small bottle to purchase even though menu said otherwise. Poorly laid out. The climate control on all the flights seemed to be broken or not working properly! Staff were absent during flights for extended periods. Their beer choices consist of 2 types of the worst beer that were barely cold. The front pouches were broken on some seats.

"Ethiopian Airlines is fine.  The seats are decently comfortable.  The entertainment system was terrible!  It had to be rebooted several times during our flight because it stopped working.  Then on my last leg home (Dublin to LA), my screen didn't work at all!  It was so disappointing. The food was fine, but they didn't give much.  Even on the long leg, they only gave one hot meal.  The rest was snacks.  I generally expect 2 hot meals (dinner and breakfast) on a 10+ hour flight.I also did NOT enjoy the stop in Dublin.  It's pretty brutal to not be allowed off the plane after an 11 hour flight, with 8 more hours to Addis Ababa.  It was annoying, too, because while the cleaning crew was asking us to stand up so they could clean around us, the flight attendants were yelling at us to sit down and stay in our seats.  It's not a very good system (and watching them ""clean"" the plane did not give me much faith).  The check-in at LAX was an absolute disaster.

"My wife and I flew with my Mom back from our wonderful Tanzanian safari, but had a pretty poor experience flying Ethiopian Airlines.  My Mom flew first class on our legs from Kilimanjaro to Frankfurt, while my wife and I flew economy.  My Mom requires a walker to get around due to her arthritis.  When we asked for wheelchair assistance and told them my Mom needs to use the lift to get on the plane, the ground crew acted like this was a hassle, even though we specified we needed this service when we booked the trip.  Since this airport doesn't have jet bridge service this means the crew needs to use a truck and lift to get people in wheelchairs on board.  But they did accommodate us.  But while we were being put on the truck to put us on board, one of the agents asked to take my Mom's walker, and I told him she needs it to walk around when getting on/off the plane.  He insisted that he take it from me and indicated he'd put in under the plane.  I asked several of the flight attendants why they are doing this and told them we needed this walker when we got off, as we'd need to walk to our connection in Addis Ababa.  The short story is, the walker was nowhere to be found, no one could tell us what happened.  The crew that was on board really didn't seem to care that much about the situation and couldn't explain to us what was going on, so Mom was left to walk for a while without a wheelchair being provided and without her walker.  We finally got the walker back when we landed at Frankfurt, thanks to one agent there that understood what we needed.  But it was really a poor showing overall for Ethiopian and given we paid for a first class seat - we expected a lot more from this airline that seems to be getting a lot of accolades.  The other interesting note is the utterly awful lounge in Addis Ababa for Ethiopian Airlines.  The bathrooms were disgusting, the chairs and decor were dated and inadequate given the number of people at this hub airport.  The food was decent but that's the only positive thing I'd say.  Will stick with Qatar Airlines or other reputable service when flying to this region again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/88/46/47/johnramesjr.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnramesjr,John A wrote a review Jul 2018,John A,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",444 contributions,71 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Frankfurt,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r596823398-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Very bad communication, very bad lounge, took my Mom's walker without explanation",Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My family of 5 took a round trip flight from LA to Dublin. Both flights were non stop which was very nice for us. On the way to Dublin my husband and I had bulkhead seating. The extra legroom was nice but the seats are not as wide as the other seats and if someone is using the bassinet the middle seat can not move the TV screen and you need to climb over the seat if you want to get up. On the way home we had regular economy seats and they were much better.      The food was ok on the way to Dublin. It was much better on the way to LA. The outgoing flight left at 12:30 AM so we tried to sleep. The temperature was very comfortable for both flights. The movie selection was pretty bad. I found some things to watch coming home but they were nothing I would have watched if anything good had been offered.      The seats were some of the most comfortable I have had while flying. There was plenty of legroom in regular economy. The person in front of me did recline the entire flight so it was a bit tight if I had to get up.      Overall we would fly with them again. The planes were both the 787 and they controlled the tint on the windows throughout the flight. They kept it dark the majority of the flight but would brighten it if they were getting ready to serve a meal. Both flights had 2 meals served. The food was enough to fill you up and the lunch coming home was quite good.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desertmom64,Desertmom64 wrote a review Jul 2018,Desertmom64,"Ridgecrest, California",13 contributions,17 helpful votes,Los Angeles - Dublin,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r596794926-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Very nice flight,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ethiopian Airlines is really great with service on board and the planes are comfortable with great entertainment for all family members. However the layovers in Addis Ababa were not great at all. On our way to Dubai we had a 6 hour layover in Addis, The airport Bola, needs some serious renovation to make it comfortable and to compete with other international airports. Bola airport is very busy because it gets a lot of air traffic with connecting flights to other destinations but it looks like a domestic airport. The infrastructure needs a serious overhaul to accommodate the number of people, they should also consider having wifi.

On our return we had an overnight layover, the airline arrange accommodation for you but I wish they asked you what your needs are especially when travelling as a family with young kids. When we landed it was cold and it took forever for the shuttle to get us to the hotel. The hotel was substandard and there were no blankets. Yes we did not pay extra for the accommodation but something decent would be enough.

There is not a lot to do at airport but the worst part was when the plane was ready for boarding. The security queue was horrible with more than 1000 passengers cramped in smaller area. It felt worse than how cattle’s are transported.
The boarding process for the flight was equally pathetic.
Overall, flight was comfortable but then our luggage didn’t arrive with us and staff at delhi airport had no clue about this and had no electronic system to check and just lodged the missing bag complaint.

"We booked Economy class for all 3 of us. It started with a delay of approx. 30 minutes in Cape Town, in a dirty plane and although the service was not great, it was acceptable bearing in mind that we got a very good deal/ tariff. But the chaos started when we arrived in Addis Ababa. We have had only a very short transit time and due to the amount of people and non organised queuing facilities, we could not catch our connecting flight. After a close to 12 hours flight we had to queue with all other stranded passengers for two hours until they provided us with a voucher and a new boarding pass for the next morning. We got a bus transfer to a hotel called ""Ethiopia"". This Hotel can not be described as bad as it was. It was an absolute shocker. The hygienic standards are terrible, the rooms had no warm water and the breakfast was of very poor quality if you can call it a breakfast.

"We had been wanting to Travel to Tanzania and Egypt for quite sometime now. We found a really good deal using our ANA miles to book a business class trip to Africa for Safari, Beach and Pyramids.

I was easily able to book a flight originating from London to Dar-eh-Salam then onwards to Cairo all on Ethiopian air.

We flew the bran new A350-900 from London to Addis Ababa. The seats were spacious and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and lay flat.
The check-in was super easy in London, they greeted us with a warm smile and within 10 minutes we were all checked in and ready to go through security. A perk of travelling business class is the ability to get Fast Track at the London airport through security.

Once we boarded the flight, the flight attendants had a smile and welcomed us on-board and as soon as were were settled in, we were offered juice or champagne.
On board service was excellent. The crew was friendly throughout the flight.

The highlight of this journey was the amazing food they had on-board. My wife is a vegetarian and they had a Biryani with lentils, my wife said the taste was delicious. Me on the other hand the Chicken which also was amazingly tasty.

Overall Ethiopian Airlines has a fantastic product. I will recommend them for any future travel to Africa in a heart beat....

Thanks for the great service ans smile to the crew of Ethiopian Airlines",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/c1/23/d9/nate-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/obsoletekoka,Nate K wrote a review Jul 2018,Nate K,"Charlotte, North Carolina",88 contributions,37 helpful votes,London - Dar es Salaam,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r595060965-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Absolutely Gracious Service,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well with South African Airlines not being an option, going with ET from Windhoek was the best option, especially with a cheap one ticket, exactly what I needed. Yet the list of issues just never ends :

1) Payment methods online - absolute disaster. Needs to be seriously fixed, and fast.
2) two hours delay at take off
3) absolute chaos at ADD
4) transfer was made by an airport bus driver driving like Tony Schumacher

"I was hesitant to book with Ethiopian airlines based on reviews I had read.
However the schedule suited us.
We flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi with a stop over in Addis Adaba.

Firstly our plane was delayed by a couple of hours in Addis Adaba which is no big deal however we were ushered into a gate that was a construction zone through security where we had to wait. There was no air conditioning and the drinking water tanks were all empty.
When we finally got on the plane I had to ask 5 times for some water for my children.

I had pre selected our seats and was told that due to traveling with children we could not sit in the selected seats as it was an exit row. So they reallocated our seats and we were not sitting with our 5 and 7 year old children. I argued that I was not willing to allow my young children to sit next to strangers. I was told that I had to swap myself with other passengers when I boarded the plane. Luckily the other passengers allowed us to sit together. No thanks to Ethiopian Airlines. I also noticed after boarding that our original allocated seats were NOT in an exit row.

When we arrived at Nairobi 2 of our bags were missing. After spending over an hour filling out paperwork at the airport we finally got to leave without the 2 bags.

After 3 days of having no clothes mosquito spray and toiletries which we had to purchase ourselves again, our bags were located and my safari company picked the bags up for us. When we received the bags they were both badly broken beyond repair.

I spoke to the manager when we returned to the airport and was told there was nothing she could do and we should speak to the manager when we arrive back to Johannesburg.

I spoke to somebody at the desk in Johannesburg and he gave me more paperwork and was told somebody would contact me.
It has now been 3 weeks and after I have sent many emails, messages etc I still haven’t heard back from the airline.

This airline states that it has a goal of being the best airline in Africa. Well I think they should change there goal to not be the worst airline in the world.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809SteveH,Steve H wrote a review Jul 2018,Steve H,"Melbourne, Australia",64 contributions,37 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r594736986-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst airline I have ever encounted,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have made a two way trip with ethiopian airlinee in July 2018. Here are the problems i enounters which you may wish to look out for:

1) the departure for one of the flight was advanced for 1.5 hr. It informs me by email. So always make sure that you leave them with correct email.

2) Even if the flight departs on time, it can be late for arrival which is very surprising (without any traffic jam, detour, delay in landing etc). One of my flights had delayed by 1.5 hr by arrival, thereby shortened my transit time for another flight to 0.5 hr (i could just make it). They have announced such delayed arrival timeframe at the beginning of the flight, thus it is anticipated. Why can’t they make better calculation when they sell tickets? Thus you may consider allowing more transit time to play safe.

3) Addis ababa airport is simply CHAOTIC. As of today (7 july 2018) the public announcement system does not seem to work, a lot of people don't know which gate to go, a pot of people in the wrong queue, some people miss the flight, simply chaotic. Thus if possible, pl allow more transit time.

4) some flights are very old. Today (7/7/18) i got on a flight with only communal TV, and the food could only be heated to lukewarm.

5) i have ordered special meal and unlike other airlines, they dont record which customer had ordered special meal. Only when i asked for vegetarian food will they provide it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katchoi,katchoi wrote a review Jul 2018,katchoi,"Hong Kong, China",12 contributions,2 helpful votes,Bamako - Hong Kong,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r593940385-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Watch out!,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We flew from Jhb to Addis Ababa. Ethiopian use a small Boeing 737 for this leg. The plane was packed and seating was far too uncomfortable for the 5h30min trip. Bole International Airport is Addis Ababa is terrible. The transit area hardly has decent restaurants and seating is 'grab a seat' style. Washroom facilities are bad. Our second leg, from Addis to Zanzibar via Kilimanjaro was in a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. What a pleasure. The plane is eerily quiet and the flight was half full, and from Kilimanjaro abour 25% full. Our return journey also for this leg was on the Airbus A350, another pleasure. However from Addis to Jhb was again on the cramped 737.

"I booked the flight from CT to Bangkok 8 months prior to our holiday to ensure a good fare and thorough planning. Our connection time was perfect since we took off from CT and we were scheduled to only collected our Baggage in Bangkok.  A month prior to our flight I was informed by our TRavel Agent that Ethiopian Air had cancelled the Addis- Bangkok leg of the flight meaning we would have to remain in Addis 24 hours and only fly to BKK the following day! A few weeks past and we were informed that they had reinstated the flight but that meant a mere 30 minutes ‘legal’ layover time in Addis.  I insisted on documentation prior to our flight to confirm that we would not miss our connection and requested written confirmation pertaining to the steps that would ensure we had a smooth plane- bus - plane transfer. This was provided and assured prior to our departure.  Things turned sour when we were delayed 45 minutes # at CT International. We therefore landed long after our connection was due to depart. Once again we were assured by cabin crew that the plane would wait for us as we were not the only ones affected.  We received written as well as verbal reassurance that we would not have to go through transfers.  What transpired was pure chaos.  We were herded like cattle into the Bangkok Shuttle bus which proceeded to take us on a round- a - bout trip to the terminal. We were directed to no mans lans and again pacified to believing that they were channeling us in the right direction! To no avail.  It was horrid.  Eventually an honest ground crew staff member admitted that our flight had departed without us.hints were made that one piece of luggage was in Addis airport and the other bound for Bangkok.  Pure chaos, complacency, a horrid, crazy experience! We duly missed our BKK - Hanoi flight which I had booked and paid for 8 months prior.  Also missed a day and night which we had planned to spend in Hanoi and certainly not Addis Ababa.   Efficient , slick, professional organizational skills are clearly lacking under the Ethiopian Airline banner!  Very sad indeed. Spent a night and wasted day in an awful hotel in Addis.

"we departed 2 hours late, after firstly a technical problem (this is still fine cannot be controlled)but then after that, passengers started to dis-embark which then requires baggage to be offloaded, The Captain did not seem to take control of the situation and allowed the passengers to dictate their actions. Causing the further delay.  But then after landing in Addis we were rebooked, but no information was given, so you have no idea what to do, where to go, or where you are rebooked! Then when rebooked via Vienna to Frankfurt, again the connection time too short,  With another delay, missed the second flight! so had to be re-booked again, This required back and forth from several counters & terminals, as nobody could confirm what the process is. When talking to cabin crew about connecting flights or plans, they answered “we will talk to ground staff when we land” I pointed out that this would be too late as my flight would have left by then! I know there is radio contact with operations on the ground from the plane, they could have found out the plan and informed all the passengers before we landed, which flight,which gate and all such information, this would have eleviated a little of the stress we as passengers were experiencing. Also the cabin crew did not seem to have control of the passengers, not only were passengers helping themselves to stuff off the trolly, most passengers were up out of their seats before the aircraft had stopped, all because they didn’t know what the status of their connection was. And no crew told anyone to return to seats (seatbelt signs were still on) I also stood up, not knowing if my connecting flight was waiting or had already departed. A little bit of preplanning, information and authority would have gone a long way on this flight. Please review your schedule of transfer, connection times.

There is always a delay in their flight schedules; hence causing further flight delays during transit in Adis.

Their ET920 and 921 are however very comfortable.

"This is the third major trip I've taken with this airline for a total of 12 flights -- twice to Kenya and once to South Africa. From now on I'm going another way.

The final straw was a delayed flight from Cape Town, which meant we missed our connection in Addis and had to stay 24 hours for the next available flight back to the States. The delay was a technical glitch, and I do not blame the airline for that. I blame them for putting us up in a lousy hotel while we waited. At least half the plane had to be accommodated.

Apparently some had a great place that even had a pool, spa, and a hair salon, but we were put up in the African equivalent of the ""Happiness Hotel"" (think The Great Muppet Caper). While luxury is certainly not necessary, we should have been put in a place that had decent rooms with towels and shampoo in the bathrooms and a hair dryer available. We weren't allowed access to our luggage, so certainly the airline could figure out that we'd need some help.

And speaking of luggage.... All of our soft-side luggage was soaking wet when we got it home. Our clothes had to go right in the wash, and we needed to dry out everything else. One book was ruined. It was raining the day we were stuck in Addis Ababa and, at least for a while, our luggage was clearly waiting outside.

The other thing I realized about flying this airline is that because of its hub location in Addis, other airlines aren't available to take up the slack. We couldn't be re-routed.

Then there is the fact that the airline personnel just cannot seem to control its passengers. In every location I've been in (five), the crew can't manage the embarkation process, and there is pushing and shoving and basic chaos.

There are some good things about this airline. Leg room is okay, for one.

"Although this is not the first time I have flown Ethiopian Airlines, this is the first time in Business class. The seats are comfy, the entertainment system is really good with a wide variety to choose from, the staff at check-in and on board were friendly, considerate and helpful. The food was delicious and there was a good selection of wines. Pleasantly surprised at the Ethiopian Chardonnay! The change over in Addis Ababa was quite quick and uneventful. The business class lounge was busy and I wasn't there long so I didn't have any refreshments, but the wifi worked well enough to connect up with a colleague who had flown in from Maputo and was joining me to Paris. The airport generally is very busy even well into the night but I never felt unsafe. On arrival in Paris, my bag took an age to come out and I feared that it hadn't made the connection but it arrived eventually and all was well. I would definitely fly Ethiopian Airlines again.

"Flew in June from London <-> Lilongwe, via Addis. Business Class ticket was approx £1,800 - vs. £850ish Economy.

Outbound:
- Flies from Heathrow T2, super quick check in and no other people in the fast track queue for evening flight out on a Saturday
- Access to the united lounge, with decent food and a good selection of drinks at the bar
- Boarding process worked well and got into a new A350, albeit fitted out at a lower spec than a Qatar or similar high end airline (the price point reflect this, which is why I give them 4/5)
- Seats are flat, albeit they don't all have direct aisle access in the 2 + 2 + 2 configuration they use.
- Champagne nothing too special, but pleasant. Amenity kit also average only
- Didn't eat the food as we wanted to sleep. Somewhat annoyingly they clattered about for a long time serving people who hadn't eaten beforehand
- Nice big touch screen fixed in place (better than BA!), but a limited selection to watch
- Overall though, a good flight leg

Addis:
- Routed down to a small and awful terminal for next leg of flight. Waited for 2 hours with no wifi or access to drinks, rather than being routed to lounge in other terminal. A bit annoying, and not a great experience. Will improve when new terminal is finished in the next year or so

To Lilongwe:
- An old plane, shared video screens, but it's a 3hr 20 mins flight, so fine.
- Food was terrible, but coffee and snacks tasty
- Seats, 2+2 config, just recline a bit - but it was enough for the short flight

Return flights similar experience, although their Lilongwe check in was a bit painful as they didn't really prioritise the Business Class queue. Cloud Nine lounge at Addis is fine, albeit gets crowded.

Overall, a much better business experience than I was expecting given the price point and airline. This isn't like flying Qatar, Emirates, or Singapore, but holds up against a few others IMO - given it's half the cost.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/9c/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisB333,Chris wrote a review Jun 2018,Chris,"Harpenden, United Kingdom",138 contributions,122 helpful votes,London - Lilongwe,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r590184134-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,4/5 given due to the pricepoint for business class,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Please dont use this airline, they have no clue in terms of air travel. Travelled with them for the first time, waited in transit for six hours and still no luggage. It was not just me but more then 50 people. I was told by the Dubai airport staff this is normal with this airline. So if you think your luggage needs it own flight then fly with them else avoid them at all cost to save yourself time and stress.

We had an overnight flight, so sleep for the most part, however we had a light breakfast, which was delicious. Fresh fruits, eggs and more.

"Well, Well, Well, I think y'all need some coffee on this one. I was traveling to South Africa Johannesburg and since i was flying Ethiopian Airlines i had to pass through Ethiopia to my destination. First the Flight was kinda overbooked  and very very old so i was among the last passengers to board and when i got in,my seat was taken. And halfway the flight at the back was all men (2 football teams) Got too scared and a flight attendant just told me to seat wherever i could see a seat. Which i did. A few minutes later a passenger came and claimed the seat and i had to stand. Anyway, finally got a seat but it was so uncomfortable. The food to me was just pathetic so i preferred fasting for once. The guy seated next to me was so disgusted that he opted to join me in fasting. The Second flight from Ethiopia to Johannesburg was the best. Spacious and more comfortable. Wasn't too crowded and the meal was just perfect. Had a wide selection of movies too and the flight attendants were more friendly, well groomed and looked relaxed. I would rate the first flight 2/10 and the second flight 10/10. Mind you all were Ethiopian but with different experiences. As i flew back home i was shocked to learn that i wasn't flying Ethiopian but Malawian. Most uncomfortable flight ever. (I hear Ethiopian have shares in malawian airlines so they mix passengers. The toilets were too smelly and old. Most uncomfortable flight ever.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiamutheu,lydiamutheu wrote a review Jun 2018,lydiamutheu,"Nairobi, Kenya",4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Nairobi - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r588277774-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,My First Flight with Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This particular flight had a good selection of movies, but the salmon that served for lunch was super dry and the rice was not tasty.  But the biggest negative is Ethioipian Air’s hub. The airport is the airlines’ Achilles Heel. Terminal 1 should be just shut down or rebuilt.

"Have you ever been on a flight from a major international carrier that is diverted to another city in another country to pick up more passengers, resulting in missed connections?  Ethiopian does that.  Did you then encounter indifferent airline representatives that really don't care what happens to you?  Ethiopian does that.  Have you ever been in an airport that looks like a bus terminal in a bad part of town, circa 1975, during holiday travel season?  Addis Ababa does that. If you've been rattling around this old globe long enough you'll probably remember experiences like this. But I thought that was the bad old days.  Ethiopian Air can take you right back there.  Flights are okay, if they go where they say they're going to go, but if you have to transfer in Addis, fill out your will in advance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/fb/d4/44/zouave2k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zouave2k,Zouave2k wrote a review Jun 2018,Zouave2k,Washington DC,59 contributions,56 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Kilimanjaro National Park,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r587059701-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Deficient in so many ways,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelled Kigali-Addis 8th June 2018 at 02 a.m. on a small B737-700. Upgraded successfully from economy class by putting my modest bid through their homepage. Check-in was very lengthy as they could not issue the second boarding pass when I was upgraded on the first sector. I could not accept it and stood at the counter almost ½ hour before the second BP came out. Worth waiting for compared to waiting at a transfer counter in ADD to get it. It eventually went through and I then enjoyed the lounge access in KGL and good service on board in the four rows of business class (cabin ½ full). I was disappointed they only served breakfast as I needed dinner. But I spotted from the menu card the dinner served on the incoming flight. I then managed to secure my favourite dinner from that menu, despite it was not on offer and a few hours old, but reheated. Pre-departure champagne brut (“Lallier”) was fine. FAs attentive.

"Transited in Addis on my way to Khartoum on 8th June 2018. The airport (T2) is overcrowded, messy, and queues everywhere. Boarding tedious and waiting for ½-1 hour for the bus in overcrowded narrow room at Gate 13. We became >½ hours late departing, but as the plane was full it was almost excusable. As the pax-load was full and the aircraft was a smaller B737-800 they were seizing and checking in hand-luggage for a lot of overloaded passengers, inclusive of myself. I argued that I need to go with my hand-luggage as I was only transiting in KRT and could not retrieve it easily without a visa to Sudan. After some discussion they eventually allowed my two pieces to pass to be taken on board. On board I had one of my best economy flights for years: FAs were fit, well rested, effective, focused, and kind and expedite. Despite the flight was full and the duration were only 1½-2 hours, everything worked to perfection. Two hot meals offered, I chose a fish steak for breakfast. It was so good I had to inquire for one additional. Voila, in 6-8 seconds after I told this to the FA it was on my plate. Drinks offered were plenty including wine and beers. The brands were well selected and tasted very well for economy class. The FAs came around and asked if there were other requests they could assist with. They served us until we landed and there were no stops in service from kick-off till landing. They were so well groomed, professional, and neat. IFE was missing apart from radio/music access. The aircraft appeared new and in good condition despite being an old model. At arrival, two stairways were put up allowing for quick disembarking being taken by bus to the arrival area and then confronted with the harsh Sudanese immigration where huge patience is the strongest weapon to overcome the hurdles.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andersp536,Anders P wrote a review Jun 2018,Anders P,,40 contributions,25 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Khartoum,North Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r586600003-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Maybe my best economy flight ever...,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Eventually, after an agonizing period, one of the senior attendants gave me something to drink which eased the pain and was able to endure the rest of the flight.

The transfer experience at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa was not pleasant. The ground officer who was directing us where to go was not very nice and when i tried to asked him about my luggage he quickly shrugged me off, telling me to move fast. And the worst happened, because when i got to Nairobi my luggage was missing and had to wait a day to get it back. There were other passengers on the same flight who experienced the same problem. The loss of my luggage took away the little good experience i had, had with this flight.

I cannot say i will not fly Ethiopian Airlines again because i have flown with them before and my experience the last time was good. I believe this was just one of those days. Hopefully i will have a better experience with them next time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/3c/79/92/csiranga.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSiranga,CSiranga wrote a review Jun 2018,CSiranga,"Nairobi, Kenya",35 contributions,8 helpful votes,Singapore - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r585692475-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,The Good and Bad,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I consider myself well-traveled, and do not shy away from budget airlines. I know I pay for what I'm getting and adjust expectations accordingly. However, Ethiopian Airlines has a level of un-professionalism that surpassed even my rock bottom expectations. Prepare yourself for the customer experience nightmare Part 1 of 3. I realized a month before my departure date that I had to cancel my flight. I called the Dar es Salaam Ethiopian office daily for a week, and finally got hold of someone, Charles D. He recommended switching to email to clarify details and I acquiesced. I emailed him. One week later, nothing. Two weeks later, I cancel the flight online and send another email asking about partial reimbursement (which the website promises). I call again. Still nothing. After daily calling for a week, finally get in touch with Samira who replies to my email. She says it may take up to a week for the amount to be credited. (Spoiler alert: This happened in December 2017 and as of June 2018, I have received no reimbursement in my account).

Now we get a brief interlude for Part 2. I had booked a flight from Ethiopia to South Africa that needed a change (these flights were for work) because business meeting times changed. The change was noted within the 24-hour time frame which Ethiopian Air PROMISES will be a full reimbursement. What they don't tell you, is though you'll be fully reimbursed the amount, you will ALSO be charged a change fee of $100. I emailed Samira about this and she emailed back, asking if I was sure I had booked the flight. Um...yes. I was forced to pay this charge out of pocket and she told me unfortunately, I had no other options.

Let's go back to Part 1. Around this time I get another email from Samira, warning me that if I do not cancel my original flight, I will be charged a no show fee. Yes--the flight I had already cancelled. The flight that I had been promised that I would be refunded partially for. Still no refund, and on top of that, they're going to charge me more money?!? I tried to call YET AGAIN with no reply. Fine, I think to myself, I will try when I get back in the USA. Have called the customer service again twice since being in the States, the number is apparently no longer working. Have also submitted messages through their general inquiry form on their website, still no response. I don't think I will ever be partially reimbursed; this has been the longest 'week' of my life. The amount to be reimbursed was around $200, but now, the sunk cost I've put in to try to get that $200 feels above and beyond the original price.

Part 3: Almost to the end of this saga. The aforementioned flight from Addis Ababa to Cape Town had arrived. I get to the airport. Get in line. I'm talking casually with the people around me, and since my flight was leaving first, the other passengers in the line extremely kindly (side note, cannot extol how generous the people I met in Ethiopia are) let me move to the front. I'm standing at the front desk, but the lady there won't receive me. She keeps pointing to the people behind me who all keep pointing at me, because it really was an unanimous vote that I should move to the front. She finally rolls her eyes and says I can come to the desk. I give her my passport. She looks at it, looks at something in the computer and walks away with it. I mean, past the desks, out of my line of sight. ""Excuse me!"" I say. ""What's happening?"" She replies that it's nothing and none of my concern....It's my flight. It's my passport. YES it's my concern. She comes back, still saying nothing. I try to ask again what's happening, she again says nothing. Someone more senior comes over and she gives her my passport and that woman walks away. At this point, I am very frustrated, it's been 15 minutes, my flight is indeed very soon which was why the others in line allowed me to move in front, and I have no idea what's wrong. She finally points and tells me to ask the senior person whom she gave my passport. I do--and guess what? They had overbooked the flight and moved me to the next one. That is fine. That is, with no sarcasm, a-okay with me; I understand the basic economy life, understand that this is what airplanes think they must do to make the most money at the expense of the customers. What is NOT okay is how she left me completely in the dark, how my fear and apprehension escalated and grew until I was almost in tears, unsure what had happened, what was wrong, what was going on, what I would do, how I would get in contact with my organization or my family and her clear apathy to my anxiety. If I can help it, I will never fly Ethiopian internationally again. They have me lost me as a customer, and I warn you to fly with extreme caution and ONLY book a flight if you have no doubt in your mind that you will cancel or change even the smallest detail.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547sanaa,Sana wrote a review Jun 2018,Sana,,6 contributions,4 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r585387459-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Absolutely worst customer service experience of my life,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently had to visit the UK at short notice at minimum expense. Ethiopian offered the flight at substantially less than any of the competition, with reasonable connection times. I overcame my reluctance to pass through Bole International Airport and went ahead and bought the ticket.

Maybe I’m just unlucky with Ethiopian, but in the last 4 flights I have done with them, I have been delayed twice long enough to miss my connection, and have also been loaded on to a plane with a boarding pass for a seat that did not exist.

Our flight out of Heathrow was delayed for 3 hours - once everyone was loaded on the plane and the doors were locked. We were told it was due to weather, but the belly doors were still open and luggage was still being loaded well after our scheduled departure time. There was no sign of bad weather (though we did fly over Europe on a more northerly route than we had arrived).

Ethiopian are unlikely to win any awards with their cuisine, and there are no convenient extra’s like traveling tooth brush and toothpaste given out. Their entertainment is adequate, but not world class. For some reason, their aircraft always manage to look a bit frayed around the edges even when brand new. On their new A350, the emergency procedure cards were already tattered and dog eared and my neighbour’s screen only worked after being re-started 3 or 4 times. On a brand new 737Max, my headphone socket was broken and we had emergency cards for the wrong model plane.

The airline can’t escape from being associated with the atrocious Bole International Airport, where passengers are sent to everlasting torment. I had the privilege of boarding from gate 1B, where they board 2 flights at a time, with no PA system and no screen. Not an enjoyable experience.

The bottom line is that when I have flown Ethiopian, I have always arrived at my destination safe and sound, and have collected my baggage, no more than 28 hours from my expected arrival time, so they get the job done in the end.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarmingFlyer,FarmingFlyer wrote a review Jun 2018,FarmingFlyer,"Mkushi, Zambia",33 contributions,28 helpful votes,Ndola - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r584769461-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,You get what you pay for,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I just booked my flight few days ago with this airline to Tanzania via Addis Ababa and selected a connecting flight on my way back to London which has 5 and a half hour layover in AA. When I got to the payment section, the flight details were not visible and after payment the confirmation email had a flight which has 17 hours layover in Aa! I was shocked! I called the customer service straight after, but no help, they said I have to pay a fee for changing the flight, also I’m not entitled to get a hotel room as I chose the longer layover which is a complete nonsense! Tried to call the head office in London but no one answers the calls when I call. :( I can’t beleive this has happened and no one is investigating.

"This was my first time flying to South African and also my first long-haul flight. I chose Ethiopian Airlines because they were the most affordable itinerary ($789 round trip w/1 stop). The flight crew were very friendly. The seats were comfortable (for economy class). They offered plenty of shows/movies to watch and the food, to my surprise, was really good. They offered full meals (chicken, beef, vegetarian), with dessert, and free wine. The bathrooms got a little gross after a while. The line at Dulles Airport was ridiculously long, but coming back wasn't bad at all. My only gripe about the airline is that there was no wifi available on none of my flights. I don't know if this is the case throughout their entire fleet of planes but on the four planes I was on to get to Johannesburg and back to D.C., there was no wifi and as you can imagine, being in the air for the duration of that trip without wifi is a little annoying.

"One thing that is not too extensively publicized by Ethiopian Airlines is that if you have a layover between 8-24 hours, you might qualify for a free hotel (and meals). To qualify, your must:
- you must have a passport that requires no visa, or allows a transit visa
- your layover in Addis must be longer than 8h, shorter than 24h
- both flights must be international, and there can't be another possible connection that's shorter than 8h

"I am a frequent customer of Ethiopian Airlines for more than 20 years. I wanted to book a flight to Ethiopia for this summer, and the process this year, I found was very frustrating. At first, they made changes to their website... but I found it to be not customer friendly in many ways! At the end, it would not accept my booking with no clear explanation. I made multiple phone calls using the 1-800 number and I had to wait more than 15 minutes several times to talk to some one. One of the ladies I talked to was very friendly but could not address my problem properly. The other person, dropped my call after I explained to her what the problem was. On many occasions, the 1-800 number tells me to wait 2 minutes and then it automatically reverts into the message saying they are too busy now and it drops my call repeatedly.  I called the local number for Washington DC, and after repeated attempts I was able to talk to some one.

The worst airline ever!!!! We were sat seperately with my kids 2 yr old and 5yr old and I had to lap my 2yr old from Abuja to Adis Abba because nobody on that plane wanted to give up a seat for a toddler!!!

"Ethiopian Airlines refuels in Dublin after an eight flight from AddisAbba, so when you board in Dublin the plane isl fairly full. The flight to LA is eleven hours which is exhausting. Drinks are offered at regular intervals and in between times the staff are very pleasant. Meals are tasty and hot. The out going flight was early morning leaving us in LA at 10.30 the same morning. The return flight was a night flight and we had a comfortable sleep. These flights are very popular with families. Children are well catered for. The only problem is Emigration is not done in Dublin as it leaves from T1 so you do emigration in LA and it’s a little confusing in comparison to Dublin.

"This was the first time for me. The flight started off badly as the second leg could not be confirmed from Addis Abbaba to Madiena. Apparently flight was cancelled and they could not get another flight for us. We were then told that they will book us another flight from Jeddah to Madiena but we had to confirm when reaching Addis. On our arrival there, we had no time as we had to board to Jeddah. On arrival at Jeddah we were sorted stranded for a few hours until Saudi officials arranged with the local Ethiopian office to get us a bus instead as there were no flights at all.

Also the staff seem to be confused in terms of halaal.

Also when you disembark passengers are sorted on the tarmac in groups in terms of where your next leg is headed. Reminded me when I landed in Nairobi in 1991. I expected a bit more sophistication.

"Considering that this is a really long way round to get from Entebbe to Zanzibar, the price was better than flying a more direct route. It made the journey longer, but the dates of their schedule fitted better with our plans. We endured a 6hr layover in Addis mainly because we knew it would be rough from past experience and were mentally prepared for it. ET are building a wonderful new terminal and one day it will be great. Right now the OK terminal is not OK anymore. This is especially true if there are a lot of people in transit in which case there can be literally nowhere to sit. There are no pay lounges. There were in the past and you will find hints and tips on how to find them, but they are not there now. African chaos ensues as everyone has to line up for security even though you just got off a plane. This can take an hour during which time you slowly snake along trying to stop impatient travellers from pushing past you. Once through you find yourself in the dreariest waiting area you are ever likely to encounter. If you try to go through security early in the hope of finding a seat you are like to be sent away and not allowed to queue up. During the dreaded queuing people who have been sufficiently delayed by the chaotic system will be pulled out and fast tracked past the queue.
I think it's worth knowing this if ET is going to be a good option for you otherwise so you won't be too disappointed by the big sign saying 'welcome to the home of hospitality' when there is no evidence of hospitality anywhere! It's quite often not so bad as I describe, depending on what gate you are using and how many people are in the terminal. I arrived late for a connection. on one occasion and was whisked directly to the plane.
They have some new planes and I find their service comparable to most others. I normally like the food.

"I flew with them quite a couple of times and are generally satisfied with their service. The only problem I have with them, is that they tend to miss handle your luggage. To their credit I must admit that they replaced the damage suitcases a couple of times, except for once, when according to them, I did not follow the right procedures! I landed in Delhi from Cape Town in April 2017, after a long flight and discovered outside the terminal that the one wheel of my suitcase was basically broken off! I decided to rather go to my hotel and then report the damage back in Cape Town. At home I was informed by their staff that I should have reported it in Delhi. I phoned them and sent a couple of mails, to no avail! I then liaised with their airport manager, who promised me that he agree with me and will see that I get another suitcase, but after about four months, he told me that it can't be done!

"In general the planes look clean and maintained, but we experience a constant drop in the quality of the provided service since we flu the first time with them a few years back.
I stud with a 6 year old on Johannesburg International Airport and couldn’t check in, because the flight was overbooked. They booked me than on a later flight in the same night with RwandAir, but this one was finally fully booked as well, hence I was grounded on the airport with 5 pieces of luggage and a sleeping six years old in the middle of the night. By this time already 1.45am, no one of the airline could be found anymore.
I booked finally a room in the Intercontinental, hence it is only a 2 min. Walk from the airport terminal.
The next morning I had a fight for one hour with the airline, because they didn’t like to reimburse me for the hotel room, but in the end they finally agreed.
The refund is still in progress and I hope they stay to their word.
I was booked on the afternoon flight the next day, which was the reason that we didn’t get the connection flight in Addis Ababa and we had to stay a night there in one of the airline hotels.
We became a room in the KZ Hotel, which was by far the dirtiest and most disgusting places I have stayed for long. Socket were pulled out of the wall and hanging loose, Interior were broken, breakfast a nightmare, etc.
Far from international or Star Alliance standards.
The service on board is friendly, but your service calls get ignored at all.

"I booked the flights in January already (departure date 8th of May) because the stopover in Addis Abeba was only 1,5 hour and that's great if you're travelling with a child, which I was. 2 days before departure I received a change in the flight schedule... Instead of a 1,5 hour stopover it suddenly became a 26 hour stopover in Addis Abeba! They just booked me on the next night's flight... most probably due to an overbooking on their side. I got NO REPLY whatsoever to any of my e-mails before departure. Then I got offered accomodation in Addis Abeba (as they are forced to by law) and that hotel was a DISGRACE!!!! The airline staff put me and my 12-year-old daughter in PANORAMA Hotel... The most dodgy place I have ever encountered in my life! The room was filthy, my daughter refused to wash as there were centimeters of dust and dirt everywhere in the bathroom. There was 1 small towel in the room. One! When I went to ask for another towel at the reception desk the staff said they didn't have anymore towels as they were fully booked... The noise during the night made sleeping impossible and I have no words for the breakfast. I just don't understand how Ethiopian Airlines dare putting up unfortunate travellers in that ... well I can't even call it a hotel. Anyway this was a very bad experience which made me decide never to fly Ethiopian again.

"I believe this airlines is far better than those budgeted airlines that fly in Africa or out, the best thing I liked was the service unlike the fly Dubai, where staff of fly Dubai feel on top of the world, the leg space is sufficient for a person like me with a belly can bend on to the tray and sleep peacefully. The cabin crew don't push you back to your seat if two or three empty seats have been occupied to sleep (if you have a long long flight,) rather they let you sleep.

Fly Dubai, was like we owe to the cabin crew. The ruthless talking, un professional behaviour. I am definitely getting back to Ethiopian airlines, just because of their decent interaction with flyers. I give them a big thumps up.

I travelled for almost 400 dollars (to and fro), and on that 46 for luggages, I had a back pack with camera and laptop and my bag pack looked fluffy, I was skeptical if at the counter the person was going to stop me, (I was all time stopped when travelling from ethiad, emirates, fly Dubai, Kenya airways), but the smile at the counter just made my travelling more convenient and relaxed. Its not like just once I was stopped because of the fluffy bags, it happened twice (to and fro)

There is nothing much I can write rather just appreciate their services with a thumbs up. Their timings are also convenient, I mean, we departed from mumbai at 11am, and reached Entebbe by 5.30pm, in between there was a lay over at adis ababa for like 45 minutes, but to my surprise, I received my luggage in time when I landed at Entebbe. most of the airlines fail to transfer luggage with in that time, may be because of heavy rush.

"It's a nice aircraft but the food is horrible, the crew is simple (beef or chicken is all they know in their vocabulary), the entertainment console has movies with Chinese subtitles on it.

And the security takes sigaret lighters even though ICAO rules state these lighters are allowed onboard, as a pilot myself I know.

No wonder they WERE best airline up to 2014 or so... Means they can't live up to today's standard. This airline is not as great as it was anymore.

"My travel from Abuja Nigeria with Ethiopian airline dated 12th May 2018(ET910 seat 25D) is the worst ever experience... A flight from Abuja was delayed for 5 hours and none of the airline team has told us what was the reason.. when we arrived in Addis Ababa, majority of the passenger that has connecting journey missed their flight. The worst thing, there are only 3 ground staff whom none of them knew what to do.. no instruction is given, all fury passenger to get their queries are being ignored... waited for more than 2 hours in the airport and finally the ground staff decided to send us to the hotel.. i/we (atleast 30 passenget) have been given to stay in a hotel called Jupiter and when we arrived in the hotel they cant check us in, we spent 45 minutes waiting for the hotel staff if they can accomodate us but they cant give any information.. some of us decided to go back to the airport as it became very frustrated standing in the hotel reception with no clue on what is going on... we were dropped in the airport by the hotel bus and we have been assisted by one immigration staff to go back to departure area... when we go back to arrival and transfer office and shared our experience, the ground crew almost ignore our situation and asking us ""What to do"" and commented no compensation at all in rudely manner.. a pathetic gentlemen who doesnt have a customer service at all.. A very frustrating situation to all the passenger and it was unbelievable that the crew is almost saying shut up to those passenger that are raising concern...
Please see mote of my frustration..
1. Upon arrival in Addis Ababa, none of the ground staff assited or directed any passenger.. we need to chase 2 or 3 of them to give us answer to all our query.
2. No Manager or atleast responsible staff to answer us on all our queries...
3. Staff are keep on telling us to check to one staff to another staff..
4. Hotel was booked for the passenger without checking if there is available room..some of the passnger been to 3 hotel nut were refused as apparently no room is available.
5. Passenger are complaiming but the staff in the arrival and transfer office is holding his chin and nodding with sarcasm without any response to us.
6. Some passenger ask for atleast a snack in the airport but refused by the airline staff and keep ignoring the passenger..
7. Waiting time in the arrival is almost 2 hours before we can get response, waiting to get a bus is 30 minutes the worst thing is we dont know where is the bus us no one is assiting is..waiting for the hotel staff to tell us going on is atlwast 30 minutes tilm we decided to go back to the airport...
8. Your ground team are very unprofessional with no clue at all on what customer service is..

Ethiopian Airline management, i have chosen for the second time your airline expecting a good service or someone that has customer service... i have felt that my rights and passengers rights are being taken away.. please be fair with your passenger, i will never ever use your airline again and i will do everything i could not to recommend your airline to all our guest in our 5 star hotel in Abuja.. if you want to compete worlwide.. i reckon to start with the basic customer service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoninE,Ronin E wrote a review May 2018,Ronin E,"Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates",1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Abuja - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r580341045-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Worst Experience,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Associates and friends had spoken well of their experiences on this airline and I decided to try it because the business class fare was considerably cheaper than any other I could find (by as much as 50%). I was impressed. I flew to and returned from London via Addis Ababa and all the flights were great. The business class cabin and the service is easily  comparable with airlines like British Airways, SAA and Lufthansa with lie flat seats allowing a comfortable sleep. On the way to London I had a four hour stopover in Addis which I wouldn't recommend; the airport is dismal and the lounge is adequate and comfortable if a little basic. On the return I had a two hour stopover which was OK. The stopover when flying this route can pose a problem in getting a good night's sleep because each flying leg is 7/8 hours; not much sleeping time with a meal being served after take-off and another two hours before landing. I enjoyed a meal and a few movies on one leg and slept from take-off to landing on the other (with the help of a sleeping pill). Ethiopian Airlines is the largest airline in Africa and boasts the most modern fleet of aircraft including the Boing Dreamliner (787).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/38/2a/b7/lesruhrmund.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesRuhrmund,LesRuhrmund wrote a review May 2018,LesRuhrmund,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",181 contributions,131 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r580047754-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,An excellent option if short layover in Addis,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One of the reasons why I like flying with Ethiopian is their prices are generally the cheapest. Then its the baggage allowance - as a Star Alliance frequent flyer, first bag is 32kg and then two more of 23kg. One trolley bag of 8kg and a laptop backpack of 5kg. You can imagine how much shopping can be done with the allowances.

But probably the best is that I get to stay over either going or coming or both at the expense of the airlines - hotel with meals. That gives me the opportunity to meet colleagues and to sight see. That is a really good bonus, but also with the stop over in Addis, it makes the journey easier as it is two trips instead of one long one.

At times, there are the niggly issues - not having a reserved meal, or the in-screen entertainment is not working properly, but that is minor.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/83/7d/16/ashihara.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoosainnarker,hoosainnarker wrote a review May 2018,hoosainnarker,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",6346 contributions,294 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r579984060-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Happy Experiences,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Large leg room with decent meals and memorable hospitality. Quite comfortable even on an economy class.  For stopover longer than 8 hours, you will be escorted to a hotel outside the airport or a museum tour while waiting for the next flight. All including meals are paid by the airlines. You just pay tips to the guide depending on your satisfaction on his service. (You may ask the guide or the driver to have a quick visit at a grocery to shop Ethiopia 's famous coffee. Beans here are finely selected, roasted, and securely packed in a nice design.)At Addis Ababa airport,  there are space for couch for you to relax before.  The couch yields true comfort, and I had a decent sleep for 3 hours without realizing it. The down side is about the ticketing system.  One of my flights was changed without my permission a few times. They informed me via email the itinerary but the ticketing system inside the airport had not been aware of this change.  I nearly had to pay for 145$ for the change made by the airlines. Eventually the ticketing staff phoned her manager and got the solution fixed. Though time-consuming,  penalty charge did not occur.

Business Class on Ethiopian is nothing spectacular...best part is the lay flat seats. Food is mediocre to awful and attention and service is about the same in coach and business classes. But it is generally more competitively priced than other airlines. So a good option if you really just want to sleep and do not care about all of the ‘extras’. However on a recent flight the the stewardesses continued to serve alcohol to a gentleman until the point that he felt it was okay to physically grab me on my way to the toilet. When I reported this to cabin crew and told them I wanted to move they were less than helpful and initially tried to have me stay next to this guy telling me ‘nothing will happen. We are always awake’. Well something had already happened in part because they continued to supply this guy with alcohol despite the fact that he was basically talking loudly to himself ... I honestly did not worry about being assaulted but still was not comfortable being near this guy and trying to fall asleep. Only when another (male) passenger also insisted that they move me and even offered his seat did it seem to get them to realize that they should move me to an empty seat in another part of the cabin. So obviously there is some more training needed.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alwaystraveling80,alwaystraveling80 wrote a review May 2018,alwaystraveling80,"Cary, North Carolina",43 contributions,25 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Washington DC,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r579123447-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Additional Training Needed,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight from Toronto was fantastic; business class on Boeing Dreamliner. Excellent attention from the flight attendants including one dressed in traditional Abyssinian garb. Be careful about the food; there will be a lot of it. Besides the usual snacks, around dinner time the FA arrives with a cart of Ethiopian food. 2 types of injera and 5 entrees. Memory is beef, chicken, goat, a vegetable and one more. I chose 3 and most were delicious except the vegetable which I think was kale. After the Ethiopian meal the FA arrived with the dinner entree. Too much. I was already sated. I did have the salad and the dessert. There is a good selection of European and American wine along with a local Rift Valley red and a chardonnay.
There were 2 negatives to the 13 hour flight. It departs around noon Eastern time so it is difficult to sleep until the last few hours. The full flat bed felt slightly short for me at 5' 11"" and the space for your feet is quite narrow. The pillow and duvet are high quality. This may be true of many Dreamliners or may just be Ethiopian's design. The selection of entertainment is vast and varied. The reading light does not provide enough illumination for reading.
Addis Ababa is not a fun airport. Lots of small duty free stores mostly specializing in cigarettes. The business class lounges are divided by mileage and I was in the lowest tier.There is also a Gold and a Platinum lounge. The breakfast food wasn't very good but I had coffee, fruit and pastry. My next leg departed at 2 and by 10 AM I was alone in the lounge except for the cleaning staff. I kept changing my seat to stay out of their way as they vacuumed and mopped :-)
The second 2 hour leg to Kigali was on an older and shabby 757. Even in business the seat pockets were torn. But, again, the service was excellent. The FA was rushed to serve a snack that was immediately followed by a lunch
(I chose Ethiopian because most flights in to Kigali are on older equipment. This route would provide me the greatest length on the better plane and the shortest on the older model.)
Although my baggage was tagged priority they were among the last to be delivered. Probably due to the extended layover in Addis they were loaded first and therefore off last. Immigration at Kigali has significantly improved and now visas can be obtained on arrival. There is also an East African visa that allows travel in Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya on a single (more expensive) visa in case you plan to see more of the continent.
The return trip was pretty much a copy of the first. Boarding in Kigali is by bus and there is a dedicated bus for business class. Boarding in Addis is a bit more annoying. All passengers go through additional screening before boarding. There is no separate line for business class, so there is a bit of delay. Then once you are through security, business and first have a small area of seats while economy stands in line. I was a bit embarrassed to have the extra privilege quite so publicly on view
I chose more wisely on the dining menu for the flight home; sampling but not over doing it. The flight was more attuned to body sleep time and we landed in Toronto at about 8 AM feeling refreshed. I easily drove the 2 hours home to the states.
I can recommend Ethiopian Air for long distances but you will need to look carefully at what equipment is scheduled for your connecting flight",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/6b/65/fd/quikag80.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuikAg80,QuikAg80 wrote a review May 2018,QuikAg80,"Buffalo, New York",148 contributions,64 helpful votes,Toronto - Kigali,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r578871704-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Long haul-Short haul,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I Still have very positive reviews of the airline itself, ie. flying was very good. However, all flights must lay over at Addis Ababa airport, which is a hell hole. Disgusting bathrooms that are falling apart and unserviced, no ventilation, no air conditioning, really really bad experience. We were on a shorter lay over on the way in and enthusiastic to get to our final destination so tried to ignore the negatives after a pleasant flight, however, on the return portion we had to accept the absolutely terrible and disgusting experience. We also had difficulty with their security control -- I really dont get how women who are covered head to toe and in mixed company will allow receiving a full pat down in public, doesn't make sense. By the way ladies, I purposely ensure I am not wearing any metals so I can go through the x-ray detector, however the metal on my bra hooks set off this detector, so for that I received the full pat down search in public.

"I travelled on Ethiopian Airlines in business class from Addis to Dubai on a Boeing 777-200. The flight was in May 2018; I was connecting from another flight I’ve reviewed separately.

LOUNGE

Business class passengers use the Cloud Nine Lounge 2 (I think the ‘2’ refers to the fact that the lounge is in terminal 2).

I was initially worried about a 4 hour layover in ADD, but I shouldn’t have bothered! It flew by! I spent around 90 minutes in the relaxation area in one of the massage chairs and slept well, really enjoyed the Ethiopian coffee ceremony near the entrance and managed to catch up on social media and charge my devices (as any good millennial must do!). I didn’t try any of the food but there was plenty available - the smoked salmon, fruit platters and egg station all looked really good. I was saving my appetite for onboard. One improvement would be showers, in particular, as many passengers seem to be connecting from other flights. It’s worth noting that the bathroom facilities are basic - I’m glad I had miniature toiletries in my hand luggage.

Departure was from gate 10, which was a 2 minute walk from the lounge. Security was surprisingly quick and there was a clear priority line with a red carpet. Boarding was via an airbridge attached to door 2L.

ONBOARD

The 777-200 business cabin is in a 2-3-2 configuration. All business seats convert into fully flat beds. I was in 2L, which is a window seat on the right side of the aircraft. This is a good seat. Row 1 seems more exposed and is next to all of the noise of the galley. The left hand aisle seems to have more traffic as both of the business class toilets are located on that side.

I was seated for around 10:05 and was really impressed with the pre departure experience: jacket immediately hung (with a courteous reminder not to leave valuables), variety of newspapers and magazines offered and champagne poured directly from the bottle. The business class cabin was completely full by the time we left, although - given various conversations between the crew - I wasn’t sure if a number of passengers had been upgraded. A plastic wrapped blanket, a great pillow, menu and noise cancellation earphones were all on my seat. The crew were very cheerful, polite and willing to engage in conversation. And they promptly brought me more champagne! A winner. Drink and food orders were also taken. Passengers were still boarding 5 minutes after our scheduled departure time, so we clearly weren’t leaving on time! A short announcement was made at around 10:35 about the cabin being sprayed. The flight time would be 3 hours and 15 minutes.

Take off was finally at 11:15am so nearly an hour behind schedule. The captain made a short announcement at 11:35am: we expected to arrive at 3:50pm local time with very good weather. We were currently at 35,000 feet.

The menu service started quickly. First up was a salad, smoked salmon starter, various condiments (including small pots of mayo, ketchup and wholegrain mustard) followed by a choice of white and brown rolls. For main course, there was a choice of chicken, lamb or salmon fillet. I opted for the lamb; it wasn’t great. It was warm rather than hot, quite small and the meat didn’t seem the best quality. I had food envy when I saw the salmon! Also, disappointingly, there was no Ethiopian meals loaded, nor was there on my earlier flight. A shame.

Thankfully the dessert service was really quite impressive with four options all offered from a trolley. I opted for the cheese (three different types) and I was given a whole plum, orange and pear! I had an Ethiopian coffee with two tasty Lily O’Brian chocolates shortly afterwards. There was also another trolley run of drinks, this time with brandy, Bailey’s, port and various other options. Nobody should have gone hungry or thirsty on this flight!

The rest of the flight was quite uneventful. Most passengers slept and it was great to have a fully flat bed and comfy pillow for such a short flight. I like to be cool when I sleep and found the cabin too warm.

The visibility over the UAE was poor, which was a shame as I’d photographed various African landscapes earlier in the flight and was hoping to get something similar of Dubai! Landing was at 16:00 local time.

ARRIVALS

The taxi was relatively long, but that’s normal in Dubai. Disembarkation was through door 1L using an airbridge. On leaving the aircraft all business class passengers were given a card to use the priority immigration line. This was the quickest arrivals experience I’ve had in Dubai: a very short line for immigration (both for the regular and fast track lines - I wish I’d had that card on previous trips....) a short wait for my suitcase (albeit mine was thankfully one of the first off) and straight into a waiting taxi outside.

Overall this was another impressive flight with Ethiopian. The lounge is basic but most of the basics are there: places to seat and sleep, decent WiFi, great coffee and a good selection of food and other drinks. I found the onboard experience very good too: really strong hard product, free flowing champagne, a variety of other drinks and a pleasant hard working crew. The food was a mixed bag with plenty available but the main courses on two consecutive flights were underwhelming.

I would fly Ethiopian again without hesitation; I’m wondering what they are like in economy.......!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameshenson6,jameshenson6 wrote a review May 2018,jameshenson6,"London, United Kingdom",116 contributions,53 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r577892510-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Exceeded my expectations ,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was memorable trip. The flight to Addis was good in a dremliner aircraft. The food was good, service was ordinary.

Money exchange is situated after the departure from the international airport. If you need to pay your hotel bills in Etheopian Bir, please keep the receipt from the money exchange. Without that you are only allowed to pay by card.

The domestic airport is dirty. Our flight to Mekele was delayed but there was no announcement in English neither there were any display board. It was Bombardier turbo prop plane quite small. Thankfully the flight time was also very short. Mekele airport is a comparatively clean airport.

"We were flying from Dubai to Durban with a stop off at ADD-JHB-DUR.

The first airline flight was simply the worst I have ever flown in my life. I travel quite a lot and I would recommend any other airline from this one, even Wizz air was miles better. Not heard of it, exactly!

The staff on the plane were very very rude.They rolled their eyes, tutted and sighed when asked a question. I did not get any answers from anyone just passed along to someone else who didn't care. One even pushed my out of the way when moving down the isle and then into my seat...PUSHED!!! Then I saw one hostess physical grab a sleeping child legs and rag them into their seat. The child woke and started to cry. Unbelievable!!

For the next 5/6 hours my service light was one the whole time. Nobody came. I then took it upon myself to go to the planes kitchen and help myself to drinks and snacks for me and my wife, plus the family in the next row on more than a few occasions. Where were the staff??? I have no Idea!!!!! Only when food was brought around did I see staff and then, you guessed it, they could not care less!

Landing at JHB we had our camera and mobile phone stolen from our bag as they had been taken to the secure baggage claim? Why? We got no answer again. Staff clearly pilfered our items and the whole system suggests widespread corruption. We when to the help desk to ask to file a report but the staff member told us we can not file one and went back to playing on there mobile phone. When pressed again they went into the back room and ignored us.

After this we went to the police!

Since then we have tried and tried to get responses from the airline. No one responds. We email everyone until someone answered. Finally they offered us $300 dollars voucher to spend on there airline again!

"First of all, the trip to Ethiopia was beyond my excitement of all. Therefore, whichever airline I took did not really matter. Although Ethiopian Airlines are average by all means, but the charms of Ethiopian people surpassed all those matters. Yes, my trip to Ethiopia is and will continue to be one among my most exciting and memorable trips I have had in life. The direct flight from Bangkok to Addis Ababa makes it convenient. I wouldn't mind for a revisit to Ethiopia some days, and especially for many more things to see.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjoy2000,drjoy2000 wrote a review Apr 2018,drjoy2000,"Bangkok, Thailand",3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Bangkok - Addis Ababa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r576983233-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,First Experience with Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have travelled on Ethiopian airways a few times. The main attractions are the air fares and the luggage allowance which is very generous at 2 bags x 23kgs each and 7kgs hand luggage. Very good for someone visiting family in Africa or going away for long. I was disappointed at my tv not working between Addis Ababa and Harare . The hostesses on that flight were rude and unfriendly however this is not reflective on my previous experiences which have been generally good. ADDIS ABABA BOLE international airport is very busy . The airport terminal 2 is full of smoke as there is a smoking room inside the airport. The wash room facilities are relatively clean. Staff in shops etc are not friendly anf are approachable. Duty free shopping is very limited but prices are competitive in US dollars. The eating areas are few and often crowded. There are very limited power sockets so if you are there for a long transit you are better off having a power bank or two.
The airline doesn't serve spirits only wine and beer. The food is horrible.
I will be travelling with Ethiopian Airlines again only because its very affordable and for the generous luggage allowance but one should brace themselves",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466rumbim,Rumbi M wrote a review Apr 2018,Rumbi M,,9 contributions,,London - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r576681464-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Budget airline,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was my first time by the company and I have to admit that the crew is great and the planes are ok but for some small details that doesn't bother much because, after all, it's a cheap flight so you can't demand much. The real problem with Ethiopian is the hub airport Bole ADD: it's really bad (dirt, excessively expensive, free wifi is good only with empty airport, the restaurants are pushing you to buy the whole food pack, nothing new in the duty free shops and the price is as absurd as a single Ferrero Rocher candy by 30usd!).

"Easy procedures in transitting while flying Ethiopian Airlines.
(In case your layover is more than eight hours)

1) While check-in at your home airport,
You will be provided a voucher for either accommodation or a city tour.

2) Once deplaning, before going downstairs towards immigration, you will see transfer desk around the corner.
Get a stamp there to be used as a transit visa.
Nore that the officer will not stamp on your passport.

3) Go through immigration and customs procedures, then leave the terminal and turn right.

4) Hotel car park is downhill on the right.
The name of hotel you are assigned to is displayed on a minivan.

5) Get on and show your voucher.
You may need to wait for a while til they get enough people to leave for hotel.

6) relax or get into town but come back to hotel by pick- up time.

"Okay, so I wouldn't say ""Luxury at affordable prices"" but my flights were always comfortable.

This is the second time that I have used this airline and travelled from Johannesburg to Mumbai. I found the cost to be relatively cheap compared to other airlines. Layover is in Addis Ababa which is quite safe - No problems there. The airport looks like it is currently undergoing renovations and is small. But for all purposes have clean bathrooms, lounges to relax in, a few coffee shops and restaurants. Their duty free shops are ridiculously priced though.

Back to the flight. Depending on which aircraft you are flying in, it can be one of the bigger ones with 10 seats per aisle, more legroom and tvs on each seat. Or the smaller planes with 6 seats per aisle and a tv every 5 or 6 seats. Either way you get some sort of on board entertainment so that's not too bad.

We pre ordered Hindu meals on all flights and were given delicious chicken curry / dhal / basmati rice / pasta / bean or green salads. Pudding or chocolate for desert. Rolls with butter. Cheese with crackers and choice of tea / coffee/ water / juices/ cooldrinks or alcoholic beverages. Just be weary: sometimes due to the time difference lunch or dinner can be served later to what you expect. I think they serve meals according to times at your destination.

Either way, flights were comfortable, food was great, hostesses were friendly and helpful, onboard entertainment at a very affordable price.

I will definitely travel again and recommend Ethiopian airlines!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/05/a1/ee/shamera-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShameraJ,Shamera J wrote a review Apr 2018,Shamera J,"Johannesburg, South Africa",88 contributions,12 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r575486336-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Comfort at affordable prices!,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I thought a Star Alliance airline would have a minimum quality, but this is not the case with ET. The flight attendants were relatively young, but entirely clueless about service, they wore a dull and very bored look the entire 9 hrs flight, totally unprofessional. So they will ignore any service bell, pretend not to hear any request, or just shrug their shoulders and walk away. My seat lighting could not be turned off, and none of the attendant could help with it.
Each time the attendant walk the aisle with water, they were prancing like fashion models, instead of handing out the drinks. One had to quick stop them before you can get a drink off them.
Their 787 Dreamliner plane has one of the worst maintained, everything looked old and tatters, toilets are dirty and not well kept, even though the plane is relatively new. It's a pity that a good plane is flown by such airline. The only saving grace is the plane is mostly empty. I shall avoid Ethiopian Airlines henceforth.

"Before my husband and I travelled we read a lot of bad reviews about the Ethiopian Airlines, but the flight was cheaper, so we decide to try it.
We departed from São Paulo to Bangkok, with a stop in Lomé and flight change in Addis Abeba.The airplane was a Dreamliner model, one of the most modern airplanes.You can shade the window with a button, you don't need to close it!
The flight to Bangkok was great, nothing to complain.No smell inside, we liked the food, on board entertainment and the drinks! The flight attendants were kind and helpful.
In Addis Abeba we thought the airport was very small, crowded, no space to seat down. The salesperson on Duty Free was a bit rude and the food there was expensive! The next flight to Bangkok was good as well.
When we came back, the flight from Bangkok to São Paulo was not good! The flight attendants weren't kind and helpful, when you called them, they would just turn off the light and leave without asking what we wanted! There was a strong smell inside the airplane, but after the door was closed and the a/c turned on the smell was gone.
A very positive thing was that there were no delays, and thought the food was good !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/ed/bd/db/fabiane-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabianeruas,Fabiane Ruas wrote a review Apr 2018,Fabiane Ruas,"Brasilia, DF",254 contributions,99 helpful votes,Sao Paulo - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r575001984-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Bom,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was traveling home to the United States after a safari vacation in Tanzania and was already not excited about the 17-hour flight, which turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had on an airplane. It was like being in a cattle car. There was chaos during the boarding process as people fought for overhead space for their bags. There were small babies on the flight who screamed and cried the entire time while the parents and flight attendants seemed oblivious to the noise. I had finally fallen asleep around midnight when the cabin lights were lit to serve a meal. Who the hell needs to eat at midnight?! I got no sleep on the 17-hour flight, even after pleading with the flight attendants to do something about the crying babies (who the parents just ignored). The seats were incredibly cramped. And ... the cherry on top ... I am covered in bug bites, which I'm sure happened on the plane. The plane was filthy, including the bathroom.

"My first experience with Ethiopian was a good one.  The long haul from Bangkok to Addis Abbaba and onto Kilimanjaro takes 15hrs.  The planes used were 787 from BKK-ADD and A330 from ADD-JRO.  The first leg was as comfortable as could be in economy class for an overnight flight.  Meal was served about 1 hour after takeoff.  I couldn't stay awake for that.  Breakfast was served about 1 1/2 hr before the 6.30am arrival and was fine, with good coffee.  The terminal at Addis is bustling but was able to find a cafe to have a proper meal and rest while waiting for the onward journey that left around 10.30am.  Would have enjoyed a stop at the business lounge but there is no access unless you are business passenger (no Priority Pass lounges at ADD).  The second flight was smooth and a light meal was served.  The interior decor in Ethiopian aircraft is colorful and bright with green upholstery on the seats. Return flights were on same types of aircraft, and all flights were on time.

"Travelling from London Heathrow to Harare via Addis Ababa with 3 adults, a child 7 years and a toddler 14 months.

Addis Ababa airport very old and quite dirty, not enough seating considering it’s one of the main points for transferring passengers to the rest of world. A lot of the same shops not a good variety or choices. Not a lot of food shops, a lot of souvenir shops and very expensive too.

Plane service from staff very bad, I don’t know if it’s a culture thing but some staff no thank you or please. They tell you how it is, it’s like they had no customer service training what so ever. One even rolled her eyes at me! When I ask them for water or if they have food for my tod (of course I had some,but I did request when booking flight), they say I will check and never come back to me with an answer. Some is just a straight no with a weird look (as if I’m asking them for the moon) without even checking.

Flight attendants talk across the aisles and passing food and drinks to each other, over passengers heads. Very unprofessional and disorganised. The same with Indian airline.

Overall you can tell the staff are tired and fed up. They’re not doing it with their hearts. What they say, how they’ve said it and body language is all key to your audience.

Food choices and quality was poor, I know being in economy doesn’t help but I’ve seen and tasted better in other economy class. When they run out of one option they say to me beef? Instead of apologising for running out of options and offering me beef. What if I had said no, then I will starve?

Entertainment wasn’t bad. Seating was quite spacious (comparing to Virgin Atlantic 12 hours direct flight). Plane from London to Addis Ababa was quite new so if felt clean. Addis Ababa onwards plane condition quite old and tattered so it felt clammy and sticky.

Ethiopian airline have been promoting their app, yet it does not work! Can’t check in or select seats!

"We decided to give this airline a try because the price and flight times were so much better than the alternatives...and we asked around and people who'd flown them said it wasn't bad.

"We got really good prices on Business class via Addis Ababa. The flight from Heathrow to Addis was great. Food was very good. Local wines were excellent & the champagne superb. New aircraft so very happy. Entertainment system excellent.
From Addis to Cape Town not quite so good. Older airplane but staff were excellent, friendly & efficient. Flat beds were superb. I slept most of the flight which was great.
Coming back from Johannesburg to Addis- again a new aircraft so everything fantastic. Sadly we had a 4 hour lay over in Addis airport! Along with about 5 or more other planes! The lounge simply cannot cope with that amount of people. The food seemed to be plentiful but the drinks were not replenished in the fridges. In the heat & humidity of the un air conditioned lounge this was a disappointment! The toilets were definitely not what is expected of Star Alliance lounge quality. Seeing as Addis is the hub of the airline, a lot of money needs to be spent to make more lounges and of a much higher quality.
The flight from Addis to Heathrow was another good one & made up for the lounge.

"It was my first experience flying Ethiopian Airlines.
I liked the flights and the services aboard. My first flight was from Sao Paulo, Brazil to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia which took me 12 hours. The flight attendances were very nice and I thought interesting that once they pass by someone who was asleep, they kindly wake the person up once food service was been served. That was nice since many people miss the food because they fall asleep during the flight. Also, they pass by you many times with more drinks and food, offering as much as you want, so you don't need to be asking.
There were nice big scream tv in each and every seat with a big variety of movies, music, games and a cel phone charger.

"Firstly let me say that both my Wife and I have traveled extensively and experienced many countries and cultures.
We traveled air Ethiopia as part of a 2 week inclusive vacation.
This is actually 2 reviews in 1 as we traveled from Washington to Addis and then a week later from Addis to the Seychelles Islands. Unfortunately both experiences were the same.
The planes were old, dirty and falling apart. On the flight from D.C. there were actually cockroaches in the lavatory.
The food on the 12.5 hour flight from D.C. made us both ill so we did not eat another meal even though we spent a total of over 36 hours in the air over the 2 weeks. The airport in Addis is unfortunately, truly, third world.
I had to ask for a supervisor to allow us to sit in the gate area while waiting for a connecting flight.
You are expected to wait in the ""shopping""area until 1 hour before take off even though there is no where to sit and the bathrooms are built like portables.
It is obvious that the airline works their fleet very hard as while waiting we watched 3 planes go through the same gate in 4 hours.
The final flight from Addis to D.C. was routed through Dublin Ireland, we landed so the crew could be changed, we sat on the tarmac for an hour, this added 4.5 hours to the flying time for a total of 17 hours. Scheduling the flight to allow for the crew to be changed in the way they did saved the airline from paying their employees, the passengers comfort and experience was obviously not of any concern.

Our lesson learned from this experience is to not allow our travel company to choose the ""inclusive"" flights, had we booked our own we would have been better informed and would never have chosen air Ethiopia.

ADD airport in Ethiopia needs a complete renovation. The toilets are terrible, restaurants are awful, food is bad and the whole airport needs a complete makeover. Its a terrible airport for a stopover and makes the wait even longer.

"Sadly it has now been a YEAR since the bank account that my husband and I share was incorrectly charged by ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES for TWO tickets that we did not wish to purchase and definitely did not use.
This review is a follow up of one written in August last year (if you care to read all the details of the lack of professional service and absolute lack of customer care for a simple mistake that ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES MADE AND HAS NOT RECTIFIED IN A YEAR) it is posted in the review titled
- $486 not returned by Ethiopian Airlines -
Only HALF of the missing money was refunded AND ONLY AFTER THAT REVIEW WAS WRITTEN.

"Ethiopian fly very modern planes, service on board is very good, and their prices are excellent. The major downside is the terminal in Addis, which can best be described as a tip. Do not go anywhere near the toilets. Need to sit on the floor while awaiting the London flight as no seats. Not allowed to go through security until the very last minute leading to mass congestion and stress due to not getting to the gate on time. I guess in life, one gets what one pays for...

"To start of i have travelled to africa a lot in 4 years and Ethiopian comes out as the worst airline.

Firstly there is no uniformity in the pricing, it is senseless and beyond logic, i was wanting to use my sheba miles but there is nothing that can be done online, so for using that i need to go to their office in Kampala and knowing how the staff is, they will cater or say sorry

Secondly worst thing i ever encountered is changing of the aircraft, ticket displays 787 and you will end up in 767 with less legroom and cramped seats

I was with my family and airline very easily said flight is delayed by 2 hours so no compassion towards customers

food is pathetic, burnt rice, and tasteless vegetables are served.

Think about it this way, flight from entebbe to addis and addis to mumbai the difference is only 25 minutes and they wont hold the flight, so 90% passengers end up missing the flight.

No proper vegetarian food is served, staff is insensitive and very cold.

There is no inflight entertainment coz the aircraft is very old.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/39/f4/d4/schaturvedi.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schaturvedi,schaturvedi wrote a review Apr 2018,schaturvedi,"Mumbai, India",46 contributions,35 helpful votes,Entebbe - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r573039926-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A good airline which can be game changer in Africa,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I tried Ethiopian as an option to Qatar/Emirates. Price was very competitive and saw that a new fleet of A350's and dream liners were available.

The staff are very friendly and service was more than acceptable. Only concern is that the interior of the fleet was rather simple seating and inconsistent. The dreamliner on my return was older and the seat did not recline all the way.

The A350 was newer and seating more comfortable, however an endless ping/beeping through the whole trip. on my asking the head steward, he told me it was the call button in economy that is very close to the passenger and they keep bumping it. i cannot believe that this is the only airline with A350's with this problem and rather a poor excuse. Most irritating if you want peace and quiet with the constant ping. Put on your earphones and try to forget.

Lastly they had a very poor selection of in-flight entertainment, old movies and selection.

Ethiopian try keep your business cabin quiet and improve your entertainment and you could compete at that level. i won't fly again unfortunately as i don't want to take that chance on a long trip again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edgar313,edgar313 wrote a review Apr 2018,edgar313,"New York City, New York",7 contributions,16 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Singapore,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r572886543-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have flown with Ethiopian airlines 6 times now. i have nothing but good things to say about them. The main reason i use them over Aer Lingus is because of price. And the planes are more modern/roomy than Aer Lingus. They are the only two airlines that fly direct from LA into Dublin. The food is ethnically Ethiopian which is fine. Its acceptable for airline food. Just dont expect it to be amazing. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. If you want a late night departure to Dublin from LA- and an early dept from Dublin to you get back to LA in the AM- then this is the flight for you.

"I did traveled the second time with Ethiopian Airlines
The price for the ticket and luggage allowance is very affordable check-in has been good and friendly.
Airplane is relatively clean just not comfortable for people of a certain hight. Entertainment on the flight wasn’t in good working order neither was the plane very clean.
I’m not sure how some airlines, or there contacted company’s check the airplanes before there departing I know there have a quick turnaround time.
Food is something where the airline definitely has to work on, the Cape Town /Addis journey is just passing food from Addis to Frankfurt is just not up to Standard bad presentation and we don’t want to talk about it further it is -5. Even though the day the have a super and relatively new inflight Catering service at there airport in Addis according to there magazine
Air hostesses been always very friendly.
The airport in Addis is a total disaster from the start to the end it must be one of the worst I have ever experienced.
The staff is general very friendly but totally over worked and not good informed, stressed and not prepared for all the customers and no help from management neither good equipment to work with.
Make sure you have enough water intake before you leave the aircraft in transit no way to buy any water or refreshments.
If you lucky to get through the area where you can buy refreshments it is in dollars $ and expensive and everything is very dirty
And it takes ages to get through security again so think twice before you make this move.

"As a frequent flyer with Ethiopian Airlines I look forward to being able to use their service. The flight from LAX to ADD is direct with the exception of a 1 hour fuel stop and crew change in Dublin. Without having to make airplane changes it makes it far more pleasant. Also of note is that they use modern 787 aircraft and do not add extra rows so there is plenty of legroom for us taller passengers.
The food service is frequent and tasty and if you desire alcoholic beverages they are at no cost. The flight crew always seem to be very kind and helpful.

"We booked this long flight (11-14 hrs depending on direction) with Ethiopian Airlines with a little trepidation, not haven flown with them previously. We were surprised at the level of service. We flew both ways on their Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes, which we found to be pretty comfortable. Check in, cabin crews, meals, schedules were all equivalent or better than other airlines we have flown across oceans on.  We had ordered special meals and they were there for all our flights. They seemed to feed us every few hours so lots of food but sometimes the quality was a bit lacking. I was a bit concerned about only having 1 hour to transfer planes in Addis Ababa and whether either us or our luggage would get left behind but we found it all worked out well with our luggage and making our connections. Would definitely fly with them again. An extra bonus was that there was no cost for any drinks which doesn’t happen too often on economy flights any more.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213donaldd,213donaldd wrote a review Apr 2018,213donaldd,,36 contributions,5 helpful votes,Toronto - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r572278310-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Very Pleasantly Surprised with Service,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The journey started with a delay of over an hour because of the 'mechanical' problem of the plane - not very encouraging sign for a flight 16 hours long. But once we entered the plane everything seemed to be alright - smiling staff, food, entertainment, comfortable seats/beds, even the wine list had a choice of Ethiopian, South African and French wine. The stop in Lome (Togo) was relatively short on the way to Addis, but very long (more than two hours) on the way back to Newark. However, in both cases, the pilots managed to land the plane on time!

One thing that annoyed me was that despite having 'priority' tag on the suitcase, it came last in both directions. There were a few of us that were waiting our 'priority' tagged luggage together. One person that apparently flies frequently this route with the Ethiopian said that this was almost a rule - priority tag is meaningless for this carrier.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/ab/17/3e/kovacmil.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kovacmil,kovacmil wrote a review Apr 2018,kovacmil,"New York City, New York",21 contributions,12 helpful votes,Newark - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r572272039-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Where 'priority tag' means opposite!,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On a recent trip from Europe to Zimbabwe and Zambia I had 6 flights with Ethiopian. Four with new Airbus A350 and two with Boeing 777. All six aircrafts were filthy. Seats had stains, baggage compartments had on 5 aircraft black greasy stains, on two aircraft the seat was broken and on all flights the carpet was dirty. On two flights the IFE was not working at all and on one the touch screen did not react. I just hope their essential maintenance processes are not as sloppy as keeping the interior clean and in working order. Even the relatively new A350 planes’ interiors were in appalling condition. There is no WiFi on any of the planes despite many airlines start to have this as a standard feature when they renew their fleet. A350s’ did not have the tail and underbelly camera which other airlines have in their A350s. Ethiopian also changed the scheduled departure times several flights without notifying the passengers until one day before.

The service on long-haul flights was extremely slow. When leaving from Frankfurt they brought the food only after three hours of flying by which time the flight was already half way to Addis Ababa. It was at 4 am when they came to collect the trays away - when there was just 1,5 hours to landing.

Addis Ababa airport is chaotic. Even “the new” terminal building is far too small for the amount of people - seat are too few and when it rains the roof leaks. The ‘duty free’ sells fake perfumes. If one needs to wait longer time between flights the restaurants - or rather bars - are appalling. There is supposed to be WiFi at Bole Airport which of course doesn’t work and no one bothers to fix it.

In the future, I try to avoid Ethiopian. I chose them because of the new fleet but was indeed surprised on the condition of the interiors.

"Dirty and Disgusting. Recently flew to Addis Ababa and then on to Nairobi for a 2 week adventure in Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar. I can't believe even for the price that an International Flight would be so dirty and disgusting. All the seats were stained and the airplane smelled disgusting and this was before we even took off, never mind after a 12 hour flight. The washrooms weren't clean and I watched the flight attendants serving meals that didn't have lids and they were sticking their hands in the food and handing them to paying customers. We declined all the food and felt ill just watching the service or lack of. The flight attendants were taking up seats to lie down and nap during the flight there.

"I booked Ethiopian airlines to fly from Kigali - Lalibela (with a transfer in Addis Ababa). The airlines changed the flight’s departure a day before but since the flight was changed to an earlier departure, it did not impact my connecting flight. On my incoming flight back, the airlines changed the flight from Lalibela direct to Addis Ababa to Lalibela- Gondar-Addis Ababa. Instead of having more than 2 more hours for my connection to fly internationally to Johannesburg, I now only have 45mins (assuming the flight departs on time) to catch my connecting flight. It takes a while at immigration and there are lots of security checks so 45 mins is very tight. Plus it’s the Easter holidays. I don’t understand how can Ethiopian airlines just change their flights to include an additional stopover a few days before the actual departure without any reason.

"Check it at dublin airport, was told to fill in a form for Sheba miles, which the stewart told us that it would allow us an extra 5 kgs baggage on our retun trip. Flight itself was very pleasant, wouldnt say the same about the food, but i think all airline food is the same. Drinks available throughout. Very attentive and friendly staff throughout. On check in on our return flight, we were told that our extra baggage hadnt registered in Dublin, which resulted in two of our friends having to unpack and dispose of items, was very dissappointed in this, boarded flight to discover that two rows including ours had no tv screens working, pointed this out to staff on several occasions to no avail, it made the flight extremly long.

"I flew 8 times with Ethiopian on this trip to Ouagadougou and then to Nairobi and back to Bangkok within a 3 week period.  This was the first time I had flown internationally with Ethiopian Airlines.   I was pleasantly surprised as I was not expecting much.   The worst flight was the one from Addis to Ouagadougou.   The crew were disinterested in the passengers and tried to hide most of the time.   The worst aspect were the meals.   There was a choice between beef and chicken as usual, but these were the only meals served.   It didn't matter if it was breakfast, lunch or dinner or where the flight had originated, it was the same meal.

"It was my first time to travel with Ethiopian Airlines. It was a sponsored team travel with a bunch of business partners. I'm a frequent flyer of Emirates Airlines and the stories I was told about traveling with Ethiopian was completely the opposite and different from what I had expected. They are very professional and food was served very generously and it was tasty too. I used to think Ethiopian Airlines was the worst Airline until I travelled with Ethiopian Airlines just last week.

"Very pleasant flights with new planes and attentive staff. Except for one case, all boarding and disembarking  was using buses. Rather inconvenient. All flights were on time. Food selection was very ethnic so good for the adventurous, not so much for us. The airport at Addis was efficient but somewhat drab, confusing and permeated with a pungent spicy odor. The bathrooms left a lot to be desired. The Cloud Nine lounge was comfortable and the Ethiopian coffee served in the traditional style was delicious. Surprisingly, no toilets in the lounge.

"I flew ET0332 today from Addis Ababa to Entebbe. When I booked and bought my flight the departure time showed 8:20am and arrival at 10:25am at Entebbe.

I go to the airport to check in 2 hours in advance and was told the flight is over booked and had to stand at the counter for 1 hour, even if the staff at the counter offered little help to solve the problem they were polite. After an hour of back and forth I was able to check it, only to found out that the Flight to Entebbe never departs at 8:20am rather at 10:00am. The attitude of the staff then became deal with it your mistake. I show them my ticket and the time no one bothered to explain or seem to understand how such unprofessional incident happened.
I decided to go to customer care booth to explain to them this is unprofessional, I obviously knew I wasn't going to change the flight hours because my flight time stated the wrong time.
But my greatest disappointment came while the person seating behind the desk was rude and never said the word sorry for the inconvenience we caused you, rather she went on to say: ""You can go online and submit your complains or wait for my supervisor who should be hear in an hour or so and speak to him.""
Some of the staff of ET go above and beyond to help people but they also have staffs that are quite unfit for hospitality.
Flying ET, I usually hear the staff saying unprofessional thing about customers in the local language when they know they are international and can't speak the language.
I also see them being more aggressive towards other African Nationalities including Ethiopians, this is my personal opinion based my experience flying ET for over 5 years. That to me is very unprofessional and offending, even if people don't understand what staffs of ET are saying about the client to each other, I believe people feel bad. For me looking at that makes feel as if they are misrepresenting our nation.
Even if Ethiopian Airlines is the flag carrier of my country and is one of the best airlines in Ethiopia, they have poor leadership at all levels and don't do anything to improve the service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mahiderk2018,Mahider k wrote a review Mar 2018,Mahider k,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Addis Ababa - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r568721413-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Unprofessional Service from Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had to fly again with them recently as my company selected the flights.

The flight was late in departing, the snack was pretty much a bread bun, no entertainment and the staff were sat at the back of the plane on their phones and playing games when I asked for a glass fo water it was if I was disturbing them.

Plus friends of mine told me of their recent travel with Ethiopia airlines that they were unwilling to land the plane when there was a medical emergency onboard, even though it was recommended, the cost of landing and alternating routes was too much.

"As a disabled person, I am often let down by the assistance afforded me by airlines, but I have to say Ethiopian Airlines were extremely helpful and kind. They provided water when ever I requested it, also blankets and extra pillows. The flights to Lusaka were on  new planes, so the seats were comfortable and there was good amount of legroom, which meant the food tray was a good distance from me, and I was able to sit forward to eat, something I have noted is not the case for every airline. The food is filing and of a reasonable quality, considering the price for the tickets, I didn't expect, but was  food provided was not bad. Having said that the menu doesn't vary much, as the flight home was exactly the same. When I used the toilet I have to say it was very dirty, so I told the stewardess, who immediately cleaned it. I have to say Heathrow's  assistance staff in general are pleasant and helpful, but the manager I dealt with was rude and obstructive. I received a lecture on how I was late arriving, even though it was obvious I was suffering, as I had difficulty lifting my cases on and off the bus from the car park, and I couldn't find anyone to assist me outside the departures and so had to push a trolley on my own, and so getting into the check-in took me over 45 minutes.

"To start with, the flight ticket was quite cheap compared to other airlines and easy to get online. Before my trip I had constant reminders from the airline on my trip. Online check-in was available though I didnt make use of it.
Check-in was fast and the flight was on time, thumbs up for that! The cabin of the plane which took us to Addis Ababa wasnt as good as that which flew to UAE, all thesame the seats were good in both planes.

"The flight was on time, which in itself is a plus especially flying in Africa. Aircraft was relatively new 787 and seat was classic business lie flat seat with lots of leg room. At Addis airport, the priority luggages came out first, but when I took the flight back to Newark, luggages were all mixed up, taking super long time for priority luggages to come out. In flight entertainment needs improvement, in both the range of offerings and the quality of the headphone. Quality of food needs definite improvements compared with other five star airlines (Ethiopia is 4 starts). Also service needs to pay attention to details, so that CAs do not get the order wrong or forget it entirely.

"Travelled with Ethiopian Airlines from Rome to Capetown and back in February and March.
The problem with Ethiopian is that you have to connect in Addis Ababa, which is by far the worst airport I have ever been to. Chaotic, unorganised, dirty and crowded. I will avoid Ethiopian airlines as long as the airport is like this.
The airline it self is ok but during the two night flights we did the light was only off for a very short time so bring an eye mask.
Legroom and comfort is not worse than other airlines and not better. During a 5-6 hour flight you get both dinner and breakfast, more or less in the middle of the night hence the light in the cabin.
Entertainment system is updated with a few new films.
The staff is friendly and our 4 flights were all on time.
No bags were lost, which we had heard was a risk.
The reason we chose Ethiopian was the competitive price but I will not fly with them again as long as Addis airport is like now.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKSWhite,Kristina SW wrote a review Mar 2018,Kristina SW,"Crete, Greece",120 contributions,42 helpful votes,Rome - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r566407486-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Affordable ,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My girlfriend and I decided we would book all one way tickets to 6 countries for a 74 day adventure. We found the cheapest flights to fit into our budget was Ethiopian airlines and could not find much information on this company and if we did it was either very negative or positive no in between.

So we took two international flights with Ethiopian airlines. One was from Athens, Greece to Cape Town and the other from Cape Town to London England. We got these flights at an amazing deal for Canadian dollars. The seats are nothing special, just your basic leather seats but they recline and not like Ryanair bucket seats. Second the food options aren’t too shabby and once again it’s a airplane not a 5 star restaurant and economy class. The flight itself was smooth and the service from the flight attendants was good.

Would I recommend flying with them, defiantly! Why you might ask? Well my girlfriend and later myself got food poisoning the day we were flying out! The extent of her food poisoning was unreal and she could not sit in her seat for an 8 hour flight. The attendants lets her sit in a chair and floor beside the bathroom (not obstructing it from other passengers), supplied her with fluid and food. When we landed they had called ahead about medical treatment (which isn’t the best place to be treated but they supplied us with what they had for free in the Ethiopian airport) then got her a wheelchair and supplied her with a place to sleep. On our connecting flight they once again gave her excellent treatment and for one, I know some Canadian airlines that wouldn’t have gone to this extent to help!

I would say congrats to the company and training diligent folks with a good sense of compassion/ respect. Keep up the good work and if you need a cheap flight look no further. Entertainment on the flight was decent as well!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploretheUNKNOWN2,MK wrote a review Mar 2018,MK,"Edmonton, Canada",157 contributions,29 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r566395264-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Cheap but solid service and flight ,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not my first time flying with them and the experience always has so drama. If it's not delays, is the entertainment system in you chair that does work, that means u got one of their really old plans. Air hostesses are not very attentive, always speaking to each other, it takes the. A while to get back on a request. Yet the main downfall of the airline is the food. Last time i flow with them, on my way to Turkey I got such a stomach ache not to long after i eat. As i was not 100% sure of what it was although suspected of the food i just eat the biscuits. This time going I had something light and was fine. Coming back i decided to try the main course again. Within minutes of taken few bits, my upper lip started swelling up. I notified the air hostess and should her my lip, all she did was apologise and ask if i wanted to try a different dish. Of course i refused. As my lip got really bad, i wrote to them to complain. They asked me for my seat number and never got back to me again.

All was well until they tried to land at Addis Ababa, failed due to fog, very scary attempt.
Landed somewere else in the desert and stayed there until until the fog cleared.
Flew back to Addis and were confronted with headless chicken for ground crew, who certainly shouldnt get a job in a brewery.
Missed the onward flight to Joberg and Windehoek, flew ot later that night.
Arrived Joberg with hours to wait in a closed airport until the morning, eventually getting a Air Namibia plane to Windehoek.

"This was a horrendous experience made considerably worse by the terrible customer relationship skills of the Ethiopian Airlines employees.

About 1:00 am on 3 March 2018, we boarded the flight to Heathrow. After about 30 minutes we were advised that the flight would be delayed for 30 minutes due to a “software problem”. About a half hour later we were told that the flight would be delayed for another hour. About 30 minutes after that, we were instructed to get off the plane and wait in the departure area. While there, we were repeatedly advised that there would be a further 30 minute delay (or sometimes a further one hour delay). We ultimately left about five hours late.

What made this particularly bad was the inexperience/lack of training of the Ethiopian Airlines staff, as follows:

1. We never once were told what the problem was, or how long we’d be delayed. There seemed to be no comprehension on the part of the staff that, after repeatedly being told that there’d by another 30 minute delay, on one would believe that estimate. Ethiopian employees need to learn that there are numbers larger than one.

2. While an endless supply of muffins was provided in large bins, only one drinking water dispenser was provided. It was constantly running out of water.

3. While the departure area did have washroom facilities, they were outside the checkpoint for boarding passes. (They were though, inside the security checkpoint.) One Ethiopian Airlines employee attempted to control the checkpoint by taking boarding passes from whoever wanted to use the washroom. When you returned, she then had to flip through a huge stack of boarding passes to find yours. The risk of not getting your boarding pass back increased the level of stress.
Note: After doing this for a couple of hours, she finally stopped and disappeared, allowing us to use the washroom without having to show any ID.

4. In addition to the employee in (3), after about three or four hours all other Ethiopian Airlines employees except one disappeared. The one employee who was left was clearly overwhelmed and had no idea how to handle the situation. Of note:
(a) He only apologized for the situation once (and that was after a lot of passengers told him he better start doing so).
(b) He clearly was unable to understand that continuously announcing 30 minute delays every half hour was not really providing the passengers with the information they wanted and would only add to the aggravation.
Note: When we finally got back on the plane, every announcement included an apology.

As for the flight itself, it was the “usual” Ethiopian service – good but not outstanding.

As per my comments on a previous Ethiopian flight, Ethiopian needs to spend a few more birr (dollars) on its entertainment system. The “blockbuster” movies are anything but, and a disappointment for those of us who don’t sleep on planes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertmK2291ON,Robert M wrote a review Mar 2018,Robert M,"Ottawa, Canada",38 contributions,22 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r565484085-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Endless delays compounded by poor customer skills by Ethiopian Airlines employees,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown with Ethiopian Airlines on numerous occasions and found their service very good. They are punctual, polite and well organised. The Addis Ababa airport has improved over the years as far as the facilities are concerned but still looks like it cannot cope with the number of passangers (not enough seats is the main problem).
The only disappointment on my last flights was the quality of meals. I ordered a vegetarian version and on the first leg on my journey (Mombasa-Addis Ababa) I was served rice with half cooked carrots with bits of courgettes and no sauce. Also, there was no tea or coffee on offer, I think it was simply forgotten. On my second leg (Addis Ababa-London) it was rice with some dry lentils and some spinach. Not very appetising at all.

Economy class was comfortable I had no problem with leg space. It felt like I had more leg space then with other airlines. The food is really good!!! (They offered a mix of chicken, beef, fish and pasta).
Just one tip: if you sit in the very last row and you really want chicken, just ask them to keep out one chicken for you. There were 2 times were I had no option (or very little) option of food because all the food were already taken/finished by the time they got to me (in the last row). The chicken is really good!!!!

"As a frequent traveler, one of the main things I look for when selecting a flight is value for money. This is in regards to the time taken for the flight, number of planes, stopovers, and in-flight service. Of course as a tour guide I prefer many stopovers for the experience, but for when reviewing a flight, I jump into the shoes of other people. In this case, the flight from Nairobi to South Africa using this Airline remains one of my favorite. The take off and landing time from and to Nairobi is not as weird as some flights-getting you home at 2AM. I enjoyed the meals, and the courtesy of the crew. On our way back, we were actually privileged to have the vice president of Malawi on board with us. You can imagine the interesting flight and view we had in his honor.

"Since it started operating more than seventy years ago as a State-owned corporation.  Ethiopian Airlines has consistently gotten better over the years, irrespective of government changes. With little fanfare, it has become a successful  International company by simply sticking to the basics: taking air travelers to their destinations safely, comfortably and as economically as possible. The company has new, modern aircraft and an extensive international route that covers virtually all the major inhabited continents. Although it is not well known it surpasses even some of the largest and best known global air carriers in terms of service, safety and price. Its on-time record is impressive , the warmth and professionalism of its youthful staff amazing and endearing , the range of high quality and free onboard services unparalleled and the cleanliness of its cabins and bathrooms refreshing. The one main area the company needs to work even harder to improve is the transit process at its hub at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. The Airport needs to be expanded and further modernized to serve the company’s passenger growth and destination expansion . While transiting to North American destinations is relatively smooth and comfortable, more needs to be done to improve connections to African destinations . It is especially important to improve the boarding process at the Airport to eliminate the mob rush that occurs when a flight is called. Surely a company that can take hundreds of thousands of passengers safely and on time around the world can control a few hundred passengers trying to board a flight at its home base at Addis Ababa .Overall, Ethiopian Airlines is easily Africa’s best international airline and like Ethiopian and Kenyan long distance runners, an African brand that has consistently improved and prospered globally.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762sammyb,Sammy B wrote a review Feb 2018,Sammy B,"North Potomac, Maryland",5 contributions,,Yaounde - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r563122628-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,A top notch international brand that remains a big secret,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On Saturday, when we checked in at Cape Town International, we have been informed that we might have a problem to be in time for our connecting flight to Hong Kong. However, the lady contacted her manager and between the two of them, they went out of their way to arrange for ET 672 to wait for us in Addis and our luggage were marked with red high priority stickers. Needless to say that neither the flight attendants nor the ground staff attended to us to get to the aircraft ASAP. Instead, we were instructed to go into the airport building and ask for support. My husband approached one of the supervisors who informed us that flight ET 672 left already. We had to go to the transfer desk where we received a hotel voucher and new boarding passes. The service was slow and we confused and disappointed. We managed to get our luggage after waiting for an hour and thirty minutes. During this time my husband read shocking reviews of the given hotel and then decided to book elsewhere.  At the hotel,  my husband checked the particular flight's whereabouts on a website and realized that the ET 672 only left 15 minutes after our arrival and if the flight attendants were informed and  allowed us to leave the aircraft first and if we were supported by ground staff immediately, we were still able to be on ET 672 in time. I am not expecting 5 star service, but we have experienced support on the flight from Hong Kong to Cape Town on 13 February, when we were transported from the aircraft to the other aircraft waiting to depart.  It also happened on Sunday evening when passengers from another aircraft embarking from the back door after being transported in a minivan from their aircraft to ours to ensure being in time. I am highly disappointed. It was a dreadful and tiring experience and would like to avoid this from happening again.

The best part of flying Ethiopian airlines was that you actually had a bit of space on the plane and this made it much easier to sleep and a much more pleasant flight. As well as very competitive prices. The down side was the service and food. However I would rather have space than good food. We got to our destinations  on time and our luggage arrived. I will happily fly Ethiopian airlines again. They are also making an effort to upgrade airports etc.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/safaridiaries,Kerry de B wrote a review Feb 2018,Kerry de B,"Cape Town, South Africa",44 contributions,17 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r562836932-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,First time flying Ethiopia Airlines ,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Superb service in all respects on a return economy flight from London to Maputo via Addis Ababa and my first experience of Ethopian.  All of the aircraft were in excellent condition (regardless of age), the staff were very polite and attentive. The food was first rate - on all journeys from ADD, the food was imaginative and thoroughly enjoyable. I really enjoyed the experience.  I can understand why some people may find Bole airport daunting.  Everything I experienced in Terminal 2 went smoothly and the place was easy to get around. I asked staff for advice at various times and I found them to be very helpful.  Ethiopian will be my airline of first choice for African journeys and special thanks to Samuel and the Maputo Ground Staff for their very warm welcome.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnA579,John A wrote a review Feb 2018,John A,"Salisbury, United Kingdom",16 contributions,9 helpful votes,London - Maputo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r562628128-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Excellent in all Respects,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were SUPPOSE TO FLY TO GHANA then to the USA!  BUT THEY REROUTED US WITHOUT US BEING TOLD!!   After boarding the plane we landed about 8 hours latter in Ethiopia!  We ended spending the night in Ethiopia!  We were not allowed to access our luggage which had our medications inside our luggage!  SO WE WENT WITHOUT OUT OUR MEDICATIONS!!!  NOT GOOD!!!  After insisting (this took about 2 hours) that we be put up in a hotel room.  We could not eat the food in the hotel it was all ethnic food which exstreamly spicy.The next morning we were shuffled to the airport, again everything that could go wrong did go wrong!  We finally boarded the plane and during the entire flight we were treated like second class customers!  We asked very politely for things that we needed and waited and waited as long as 2 hours for somethings! We finally ended our “hellish” trip in Washington DC!  I called, emailed and wrote about 7 times to the CEO or what ever he was and finally received a “reply”.  Basically stating that the airline had the right to make changes to the flight plan as needed!  No apology or any sort of remorse!

"Sitting in Paris, on our way home to South Africa, two hours after departure time and after passing passport control, waiting to board the plane, we were told that the flight was cancelled because of a mechanical fault on the plane. By this time it was midnight.

We were told to take bus to a hotel for the night. No information was forthcoming about when the next flight will be, or what will happen with connecting flights. We tried to make enquiries with the hotel staff, but they referred us to the airline (whom had no representatives nearby, so that did not help).

When we got to the hotel we were told to meet in the lobby at 6h30 in the morning. At 6h30 we were told that a bus will collect us at 12h00 to take us to a different hotel. Still no information on the flights. When we got to the other hotel we were told that the replacement flight will be depart at 21h00 that evening and that a bus will collect us at the hotel at 18h00. Still not information on the connecting flights.

When we boarded the flight (which is now 24 hours delayed because of the fault on the plain), I asked the ground staff what will happen with the connections, but were told that we will get more information when we land in Addis Ababa. So we had to board on a flight from Paris to Addis Ababa, without knowing what will happen when we will get there. When we got to Addis Ababa we were given boarding passes for the flight to Johannesburg. Our final destination was Durban, so again I enquired what will happen if we get to Johannesburg and were told that we should go to the ground staff in Johannesburg. In Johannesburg we were given boarding passes for the flight to Durban and eventually got there 24 hours after our planned time of arrival.

In terms of European Union legislation, should a flight be cancelled as a result of a fault by the airline then they must compensate the passenger with 600 euro. Se we were given a letter from Ethiopian Airlines apologising for the crisis and saying that we can claim the 600 euro from any Ethiopian Airline office. So I went to the Ethiopian Airline office after we got back home and was told that I cannot be helped because the ""supervisor"" is unavailable, but I should leave my details whereafter they will contact me the following business day. This did not happen. So I contacted them again, and was told that the supervisor was still not available and they will get back to me two days later. This again did not happen whereafter I contacted the offices and was told that the supervisor and the person I liaised with were unavailable. This being a week later.

Bad food, rude staff and a dirty airport seems rather elementary when you are stuck in a strange country with your wife not knowing how or when you will be going home. And then remaining in limbo for more than a day, without anybody being able to tell you when you are leaving or for how long you will be at that destination. The inconvenience of not being able to attend to responsibilities back home for an uncertain period of time is also a major problem.

The make matters worse, the nightmare continues to this day since we were promised compensation, which is simply not forthcoming and we should (like in Paris and Addis Ababa) just wait for something to happen or a ""supervisor"" to bother to communicate with us.

We booked the flight because it was the cheapest option and we decided that we can stomach those things most reviews of Ethiopian Airline complains about. We did not expect this nightmare. Next time we will gladly pay more to just simply have an airline we can communicate with.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kritzinger,Kritzinger wrote a review Feb 2018,Kritzinger,"Durban, South Africa",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Paris - Durban,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r562070075-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,International flight cancelled as a result of mechanical fault of the plane.

"Madrid - Addis Ababa - Madrid return flight via Rome.
The flight from Madrid to Rome and from Rome to Madrid was relatively empty, the Rome to Addis Ababa leg of the trip and back were almost completely full.
The price was cheap especially considering it was full...
The service is genuinely friendly and helpful but the toilets were not cleaned well during the flight (one toilet even lacked soap in the liquid soap dispenser only 5 minutes into the flight).
The food was OK (not amazing) but I opted for the vegetarian choices ('fasting food' during Orthodox Lent) and so that may be the reason I was underwhelmed by it.

"I wish to share my experience with Ethiopian Airlines and the bad experience due to their over booking practice.
I took a flight from Yaoundé to Addis ET 925 and from Addis to Dubai with Ethiopian Airlines. The flight from Yaoundé to Addis was not bad. A nice plane and service was ok.
When I arrived at Addis, I took my boarding pass to Dubai –ET 612- on Ethiopian and the staff told me that the plane was full and that I was on standby. I was shocked as I had a confirmed ticket and a connection to Mauritius with Emirates. I was told to go to the boarding gates and that needful will be done.
The airport at Addis is overcrowded and hectic with insufficient staff that is not well trained to cope with these situations. Arriving at the boarding gate, I met approximately 20 persons who were on standby.
When the staff finished the boarding of all other passengers, they decided to take our boarding pass and to board those who were on standby.
Unfortunately for us, things were done unprofessionally and with partiality by the staff as we have seen that only Ethiopians who were on standby were able to board. The rest were sent to customer care for a night stay and a rebooking on the next flight. But they could not rebook my connecting flight as I was on emirates. The staff as well the head of the customer assured me that needful will be done and to take the flight to Dubai and to meet the ground staff of Ethiopian there.
I took the flight the next day and I arrived at Dubai and did not meet any staff.
Fortunately for me, I could get a visa on arrival and I crossed custom and look for Ethiopian office in the building.
After 2 hours, I met the head of the Ethiopian’s office and explained my situation to him. He was unaware that I was denied boarding in Addis (despite the guarantee given at Addis by the customer care). They tried to help but could not modify my next booking as it was on another ticket. After many efforts, I was re- booked for the next day flight to Mauritius on Emirates. They were kind enough at Dubai office and they paid the 300 Dirham penalty for rebooking.
The conclusion of the story: I have wasted almost 2 days and after dozens of phone calls to return back to normal due to the overbooking practice of Ethiopian.
What I deplored in this situation is the lack of professionalism from Ethiopian Airlines. I agree they can do overbooking but at least the customer should be informed in advance and not denied boarding at the gate. A proper communication in advance would have helped to ease the situation and avoid undue stress to the passenger. And I have found that many passengers were denied booking. So be cautious when flying with Ethiopian and not sure that i will consider this airline again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/96/96/dc/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avizede,avizede wrote a review Feb 2018,avizede,Souillac,32 contributions,15 helpful votes,Yaounde - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r561847647-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Bad experience due to Ethiopian overbooking practise,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Cons: Both aircrafts (except for the 737-800W) are tired and unkept; I had to force my seat to recline and the IFE is not very responsive. On long-haul flights the toilets get really dirty, with no regard to cleaning them during the flight.

"The seating in Business Class as 2-3-2 meaning the seats were a little narrow (for me - a fairly large person at 215lbs and 5'10"".  The seat-to-seat distance was not too large either, so the seat back in the horizontal position had something of a slope, so there was a tendency to slide down, but then the feet went into a fairly narrow space that was a little  tight for them.  I didn't get much sleep on the trip (although my wife, who is much shorter and smaller had no trouble with sleep).  On the return trip (flight 500) the plane was a Boeing 787 with seating 2-2-2 so the seats were a little wider and the seat-to-seat spacing seemed to be better.  On that plane the best seats were probably in row 1, since the space for the feet, which didn't have to fit between the seats in front, was much larger.

"I got the ticket from another company and they had combined flight with Ethiopian airlines from Frankfurt to Addis. It was worst experience i had.

Normally very first person you see when you enter a plane smiles and welcomes you, when we get in the plane, first thing i heard was ""your ticket"" i didn t quite understand what she means. All the way from beginning to end this is how they communicate you. I am not sure if i have heard please, thank you or any similar phases at all. Most of the time i felt that i am doing something or and someone is mad at me.  And i am never a demanding customer, really! There no explanation on anything, i had Amharic speaking friend with me, i checked with him in case it is language issue but no, they just have no idea what service means.  But i do not really blame the individuals, i asked around little bit when i was in the country and  it was claimed that all personal are underpaid, they work very long hours and there is no proper trainings!! So it is very much management issue and they have to solve it right away!After this flight, on return, i really thank to ever stuff of another company and i was very much thankfull everytime when day smile and help me.

"Although getting in touch with the airlines was not easy, nor did they answer my emails, the actual flight was very pleasant. The plane was modern, although well-travelled. What impressed us mostly was: the incredible service supplied by the flight attendants who were constantly busy serving travellers, and keeping the bathrooms clean--yes you heard right. On most domestic flights, especially American domestic, the bathrooms are horrible, and I dread visiting them. 6 visits to the same bathroom in 13 hours, and honestly very clean. Also, the travellers themselves, as a group, were so quiet, and not demanding, it was an absolute pleasure. We left on time, arrived on time. The airport in Addis Ababa was not so comfortable, but again the flight left on time, and the attendants were courteous and hard-working, dressed beautifully and immaculately. This is Star Alliance, so now we understand that means meeting certain levels of safety and service. The food was just as regular airline food, so we always bring our own sandwiches just in case, but great coffee.
Our luggage was routed all the way to its destination, and was there waiting for us upon arrival at our final destination.

"Flying economy class nowadays is no pleasure anymore, regardless of airline. Food and service on board Ethiopian Airlines was OK. Choice of entertainment a bit outdated. All flights were on time and luggage handled correctly in spite of several transfers. The bad thing about Ethiopian Airlines is the stop in Addis.

"We travelled with Ethiopian Airlines from Stockholm to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. The flight was reasonably priced and the onboard cabin was great.

A modern 787 and 777 interior with fully flat bed on both flights. The transit at Addis Ababa leaves a lot to be desired but was only just over an hour so not too bad. However on the return flight the security claimed we couldn't take a candle onboard which we bought at Cape Town Airport. However the staff member then put the candle on her desk not in the confiscated items pile so I doubt this was the case and I found no law online about candles being prohibited. When I asked to speak to the manager the staff just laughed.

Food is not as good as other business class carriers but was better than what would be served in economy class and was acceptable for the reasonable price we paid.

If travelling on the 787 I'd aim for a front row seat as the footwell is bigger and more comfortable for sleeping. The other rows have a narrow space for your foot once in bed mode.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/74/02/5b/sean-o.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seano114,Sean O wrote a review Feb 2018,Sean O,"London, United Kingdom",43 contributions,11 helpful votes,Stockholm - Cape Town Central,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r560430867-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Stockholm to Cape Town in Business Class,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Unfortunately I had to choose Ethiopian Airline as it suited me for the timings, however I really regret starting from the worst aircraft that u can smell the exhaust gas inside to the least legroom ever to the no screens for a relatively long flight. Not to mention Adis Ababa airport which is the most crowded unorganized airport I have ever visited. Regarding the punctuality of the takeoff; we took-off 70 minutes late while we had a transit for exactly the same length in Adis Ababa so we had to run as I ever did before to be able to catch the flight otherwise I will spend the night in Adis Ababa which I can’t as I didn’t have the required vaccinations.

"The food in economy class on this airline is nothing to remember.  It is rice, chicken, beef or sometimes fish, bean salad mixed with yellow mustard.  Some of the lids on some of the meals were off.  When my seat mate asked the airline hostess to give her one with the lid, she was told that meals were put into the food carrier in that manner. Not a good excuse.  The dessert is always a cereal bar with dried fruit and the bread is cold and sometimes dry.  I do not expect to get the same food that is served to business class customers, but meals should be presented in a way that the shows the airlines cares for all of its customers.  I often ask myself who caters the food,  because it never changes and the presentation is not nice.  Maybe I will begin ordering the other meals that are offered.  I never eat the little sandwiches of pressed meat and there are never any sandwiches on board the short flights for vegetarians.

"So my experience. We fly from Dulles for about an hour, then pilot says we are turning back. Problem with landing gear not retracting. We sit on plane for about an hour then they tell us they will give us a $15 food voucher so we can get our food while we are waiting for them to fix the gear. 3 hours later we are sitting in the airport with no real update, then they announce in Amharic on the 'loudspeaker' (you had to be near the podium to hear anything) that they will give us hotel vouchers for nearby hotels. At this point, we non-amharic speakers are asking for translations from the folks who understand, and it is like playing 'Broken Telephone"". We start following the folks who obviously have a connect at the airline because they always get whispered updates first. 2 hours later we finally all get hotel vouchers then we are told to go outside to go to our hotel. Another 2 hrs and we are battling for shuttles to go to our hotel. Some of the passengers pretty much pay one of the shuttle drivers for another hotel to take us to ours. We are extremely grateful and offer to reimburse them but they refuse. Airline said they would pay for our dinner and breakfast. They neglected to let us know how much we are allowed for dinner so we can't order from the ONLY restaurant that delivers for room service to our hotel (the hotel apparently doesn't have it's own restaurant). The hotel doesn't know what we are allocated, the airline is unreachable. We are now just more than really unhappy. Yelp reviews come to mind. We are told to be at the airport no later than 6am so we get up and go. We get there and the line of people from the day before is winding. The counter finally opens at 7 but they don't start dealing with us until 7:30. Some folks have been standing since 5:30. Some folks at the front of the line are allowing their buddies to cut to the front with over 14 bags of luggage (I counted....I had time).What was more irritating is that the folks at the counter would process them, knowing they had cut the line.  Not appropriate at all.  Folks get up in arms and people start telling those cutting in line that they are not going to allow it. It was getting heated (phones were coming out to record things). a guy at the counter stands up and tells us that if we are from the plane from the previous day we need to wait ""...over there...."" ***points to a spot way out to his left*** so they can process the people from today's flight. that was when they had to call security because people just started yelling out ""No, we are not moving!"". Eventually they processed us and the people from the current day, but it was not handled well at all. I think, judging from how tired the stewardesses look, they are overworked and the airline is expanding faster than it's customer service can accommodate. Definitely a problem. They used to be really good. I hope they get their act together soon.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alusainc1169,alusainc1169 wrote a review Feb 2018,alusainc1169,"Columbia, Maryland",1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Washington DC - Lilongwe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r559427110-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Horrible Experience,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It's hard to rate an airline when you are going for a very long flight, because anything even a little negative becomes worse the longer you endure it, and the length is not the airline's fault. I will start by saying there is a nice amount of legroom in economy, though several years ago when I flew this airline we also had foot rests, and I really missed them this trip! I think every flight I've flown on this airline was on a different aircraft. The first leg of this trip, the plane was hot and dry, and my sinuses were a mess for about two days afterwards. The other flights were fine in that regard.

The food was fine and plentiful, though they wake you up in the middle of the night to give you a snack, which is ridiculous. I thought airlines were supposed to prepare you for the time zone you are heading to. We were arriving in the early morning and needed sleep. Plus, all the (very many) children had finally just settled in from running up and down the aisles, and then they were awakened again. Not good.

Our check-in at Dulles was very long -- and we were some of the lucky ones. By the time we were finished, the line extended from the counter at the back of the terminal all the way around the corner and to the front of the building. We found out later that they hadn't opened soon enough that day, so maybe that's not typically a problem.

The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. I did tell one of them that the back bathrooms were getting disgusting and she said she would check, though I didn't see later if she had cleaned them up. I think there should be a requirement that bathrooms are cleaned every two hours on flights. Those are big airplanes; the flights are full; and the floors, especially, become absolutely revolting.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKSSA,MKSSA wrote a review Feb 2018,MKSSA,"Chantilly, Virginia",293 contributions,107 helpful votes,Washington DC - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r559393005-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Some good, some bad",Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown international business class on a few different airlines in the past, so I had at least some frame of reference.  The organization with whom I was traveling made the reservations and, after reading reviews online, I was a little bit apprehensive.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  For the Cloud 9 (business class) service, check-in was rapid, as was boarding.  The seats were moderately comfortable when in the upright position, but better when slightly or fully reclined (they did recline to full flat for sleeping).  The entertainment system used the older ""two-prong"" connector so if you do not have an adapter for more contemporary single prong input, you can either opt for mono instead of stereo sound, or you can use their bulky somewhat uncomfortable headsets.  The entertainment monitor is a reasonable distance from your seat but big enough that is is fine.  The movie selection was not exactly the latest and greatest but you will certainly find a few movies of interest.  One thing I will have to say is that the food service was plentiful.  Quality was reasonable, not great, but the variety was good.   The service was excellent.  The flight attendants were very accommodating and pleasant, as good or better than most airlines I have been on. I did find the temperature a bit warm on the flight.  The one thing that was a disappointment was NO INTERNET available.  I try to get some work done on these >10 hr flights but could not do so on this one.

"Ethiopian Arilines is the most disgusting and filthiest Airline I have come across in all my travel overseas.
We were booked on the Dreamliner ET628 to Bangkok on the 28/12/16 but this did not happen, upon check-in we noticed that we would not be boarding the Dreamliner and our flight had changed, although our tickets indicated ET628.
The aircraft was absolutely filthy, there was dirt on the floor, toilets were not cleaned, and toilet paper strewn on the floor, the cabin crew advised me that a child had just used the toilet and she did not get a chance to clean it.
This is disgusting and unhygienic.
On our attempted take off the aircraft could not take off due to electrical problems on the wings, we were asked to remain on the aircraft whilst they fixed the problem, this took 4 hours.
There was another airline that had similar problems flying to Manila which could fly out of Addis Abba so instead, Ethiopian Airlines amalgamated both the airline passengers onto our flight, putting more lives at risk.
Why did they not change airlines and put us on the flight that we were initially booked on.
The food was just a disgusting as were the flight attendants attitude and the aircraft in total.
Due to the problem being experienced on the aircraft I started to get heart palpation and my husband called the cabin crew, she took a full hour before she attended to me and then brought me Panado's lucky for me my husband managed to get my medication from my hand luggage and gave that to me.
I lodged a complaint with my agent as well as Ethiopian Arilines.
An upgrade was promised to me and my family by Karonie Ramsamy upon our return, email dated 9th January 2017 was sent to us, however Ethiopian Airline staff at the airport would not grant us that upgrade.
My husband needed wheelchair assistance, this was not provided at all, both ways
After arrival in South Africa I lodged an/other complaint and sent pictures to Adelahu Mengistu, who did nothing except offer my an upgrade on my next flight with Ethiopian Arilines.
What do they think AM I BLOODY MAD to travel with them ever again.

The flight itself was very convenient as it was direct from São Paulo to Addis. The crew were pleasant but the food was pretty awful and so was the selection of films on the inflight entertainment.

"I have two experiences with Ethiopian airlines in the last few years -both led to loss of the whole ticket costs. They certainly offer good prices but if there is a risk of needing to change your plans in any way, you can write off being able to do so with Ethiopian airlines. The ticket will be lost and you will need highly comprehensive travel insurance to have a hope of recovering any of it. Having flown a great deal to and from Africa from the UK over the years unfortunately both these experiences were by chance unique in that I happened to need customer support help from ethiopian airlines which I have not needed with other airlines. Both experiences were to make changes to the ticket- once a slight error to my name on the ticket, the other time was to change a ticket travel destination and time. Both times Ethiopian airlines customer service were close to pointless in contacting on multiple levels. Little interest in helping either by phone or in person, by phone- poor phone sound quality even calling the office in the UK, incredibly variable inconsistent advice depending on which day I rang or to whom I spoke. The cost of making any destination or time alterations will be equivalent to a new ticket if they have been booked for their lower cost. In order to change our route from Harare to Gondar via Addis(10 hrs) to Harare to Windhoek via Addis (similar time) that cost similar prices online we were only offered a 5 day journey from Harare to Lilongwe to Blantyre to Johannesburg to Windhoek for an additional £300-400 person. The part of this that was the Alteration fee- this changed almost daily despite advice to the contrary but settled on £180 and £280 for me and my wife. Then the rest was ‘airfare difference’
I would still use Ethiopian but only on flights with a very low risk of needing customer services.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsbzim,Rachel wrote a review Feb 2018,Rachel,,5 contributions,2 helpful votes,Harare - Gonder,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r558857157-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Good value if very low risk of needing customer service support,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We paid a additional fee via their offer system to get upgraded. This worked as our offer was accepted, but their systems to update our booking were primeval. At Mekelle it took us 1 hour to check in, and then we could not get our boarding card for the London sector. At Addis there are no shuttle buses between domestic and international terminals. The only positive was the fact that we were able to check our bags all the way through so we were not encumbered when we walked between the terminals.

The airport lounge in Addis is okay, but nothing to write home about. I guess they are looking forward to opening of the new terminal later this or early next year.

On board the service was good, but the staff need to have a little more training.

We had to sit on the floor for five hours. I failed to understand why African airports must be so African? Holy mother, how difficult can it be to have a world class airport?

The flight from Johannesburg to Addis was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I have had in a long time. The seats were hard and narrow and there was no inflight entertainment for the long hours awake. It was a midnight flight and I just needed to sleep. It was impossible.

"It was the first time traveling with Ethiopian and I must say they are worth the price.  The level of service I experienced, the food beverages, the crew was amazing.  The cleanliness of the airline too.  The bigger plane is quite spacious and comfortable, own TV screen and boasted the biggest window out of most airlines now - so great views out the window seat.  I really enjoyed the plate of food and snacks they gave and ate everything!  Went down very well.  I had a long layover going on my trip, 13 hours and was dreading what to do for so long at the airport.  Once I was onboard I got a pleasant voucher where I was booked into a hotel not far from the airport, meals, and room included.  They brought me back to the airport the following morning.Another thing I was very impressed with is that the flight schedule is always on time, I didn't experience one delay with them, going and return.

"This was the best connection (changing planes in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and then again in Addis Ababa), so we went for it.  We have flown Ethiopian before: last year and then many many years ago.  I would say that the service is standard.  They lost my bag in Addis on the way over and could give me no information at all on its whereabouts until it finally showed up in Nairobi and was delivered to my hotel 30 hours after I arrived.  The food on the plane is about ""normal"" (not very good).  Flight attendants were pleasant.  But on the return flight, they did not replace the paper products in the bathrooms (this was a 12-hour flight!), so you had to take your own TP!  Hmmm.  The real ""cultural experience"" is Addis airport.  It is truly chaotic.  And the announcements for the connecting flights are not very effective - you have to be on alert at all times and keep asking.  I would fly with a different airline in the future if I had the choice, but would use Ethiopian again if - like this time - the connections were not good but better than the alternatives for my route (Qatar and Turkish).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/21/3f/d9/703maryt.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703maryt,Mary T wrote a review Jan 2018,Mary T,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",2727 contributions,262 helpful votes,Buenos Aires - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r557610394-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,We flew them to and from Nairobi in January,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

To us this meant we were missing our flight connection at Addis Abeba and standing around in a queue fo more than three hours to get more information. Ok, this is Africa... Finally they arranged a night in a hotel, and we reached a flight to Joburg next day. Delay of one day not so nice.
But as long as we all tend to travelling at least expense, they have to have their airplanes filled well...
Anyway, beautiful people, good service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565jst,Jürgen S wrote a review Jan 2018,Jürgen S,"Bremerhaven, Germany",12 contributions,5 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r557274763-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Lost 24 hours,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown to Addis Ababa from Heathrow and back twice in the last three months.

Good things are:

- easy check in
- decent sized seats
- above average inflight entertainment system
- good hand luggage allowance and plenty of overhead storage
- United MileagePlus points

Not so good things on my recent flight to LHR were:

- boarding at ADD is done by Zones, but it is not strictly enforced so it becomes a bit of a free for all
- headphones were not given out to every passenger
- flight information map not working
- meals were barely warm - I left the cooked breakfast uneaten as it was so cold it posed a health risk
- for a nation that prides it’s self on their coffee, it is hard to understand why the serve such poor coffee - not worth trying

Currently, this place is no more giving the landing service for the old generation small scale Ethiopian Airlines planes stopped some years ago except the privately owned companies Like Abbyssinia Flights and some from the neighboring Kenya.

The Bad:
When we went to check in we were told that our tickets had been canceled with no explanation why. We had a similar problem on our return flight.

Having to wait for my luggage to then check it in again made me lose my connecting flight to Lisbon and 400 euros of my vacation fund because the airline would not put me on another flight even though they were late and messed up my luggage situation.

"Ethiopian airlines were by far the cheapest as we made the booking fairly late.  We travelled with a toddler.  The service was really good and we received sufficient assistance with the child.  We had sufficient leg room and check in was painless.  The following was maybe of a lesser standard but given the good price we were happy to put up with it - the food was only okay; the inflight entertainment is also only okay and the airport at Addis Ababa was a real challenge - it felt over crowded and they were busy with some extensive remodeling (the toiles were clean and working), having said that the longest we spent there was a 3 hour layover, so not the end of the world.

"Yes, I know that this airline is considered to be the best in Africa and I booked my flights with them confident that their membership in Star Alliance would be some sort of quality guarantee. I was wrong.
Everything in the planer was aorn and torn. The food was not good, even though I asked for Asian Vegetarian hoping that the veggie alternative would be OK. It was not - and normally I eat almost anything. My co-travellers alternatives didn't seem more attractive. The only food alternative I can recommend is their fruit platter. It is hard to fail when serving fresh fruit.
On the first leg of tha journey the entertainment did not produce any sound. On the second leg I got sound but the screen was frozen. When asking te crew about this I got a nice smile ""we will se what we can do, and of course nothing could be done.
The flight went through Addis Abbaba which was a slum compared to any other airport I have ever been to.Even Sollefteå-Långsele Regional Airport that was closed more than 20 years ago provided better service and cleaner restrooms. The conslusion was that if you didn't get sick of the food served on the plane, a visit to the restrooms in Addis would definitely kill you off. I could actually write a special review on that airport motivating why only cattle should be allowed access.
The best thing I can say about Ethiopian Airlines is that we got to our destination and the plane didn't crash.
And - I forgot - their website is a joke. The make you believe that you can add pasenger info, meal preferences, passport numbers etc and then the site crashes every time you try to save what you have just entered.

"We found a cheap flight to Cape Town via Addis Ababa.
A few weeks before the trip Ethiopian advised us there would be an additional stop in Botswana on the return trip.
Cabin, seating and entertainment were average and slightly dated.
Flight attendants didn't seem very attentive and on both directions we were only offered fish for our main meal. Both occasions I explained I have fish allergies and once they still forced the fish in front of me... removing it when I repeated my allergy issue. on both occasions a few minutes later the attendants arrived with chicken for me.... no explanation.... just delivered to me and disappeared!
After collecting passengers in Botswana, a passenger defecated in the aisle of the plane. The crew were alerted of this and they commenced operation clean up which also included placing both (all) toilets in economy out of order for around 30 mins. Several passengers explained they MUST use the toilet and asked to use Business Class, but permission was denied.
Stop over in Addis Ababa for several hours is not an enjoyable experience. The airport appears to be modern and architect designed, however the interior seems to have been placed inside with no consideration, tatty, dirty and generally a horrible environment to be in, especially when tired after a long flight.

Overall after my experiences flying with Ethiopian Airlines I will not be foolish enough to take the cheapest flight again if with EA. I have used Emirates to CPT via DXB and that experience was far superior.

Sorry EA.....

"I literally prepared for the worst on this flight as I had read some horrible reviews before my trip.  Overall the trip wasn't that bad.  You do get what you pay for.  They tend to have the cheapest prices, but you often end up sacrificing service to save a few dollars.  The planes were fairly modern and the seats were comfortable.  I could not for some reason check in online due to some issues with their website and by the time I was able to do so at the airport, there were absolutely no more window seats available.  Prior to the trip, I noticed they had some other website issues and they also contacted me to tell me that the fare I initially booked at was an ""error"" and I had the option of paying an additional $600 to keep my ticket.  I opted to cancel instead as I found a fare that was a bit higher than what I initially booked at, but it was still much cheaper than if I had paid the additional $600.Customer service is HORRIBLE.  If you call them, you wait at minimum 30 minutes to speak to a representative who sounds like they are reading from a script.  They are not helpful.  You are better off emailing and expect a response within 24-28 hours.My checked bag wound up with a burn hole on the front of it.  There was a note that TSA inspected it, so I'm not sure if the airline did this, or TSA did it.  I can't imagine how I would have a hole with the plastic around it melted from just a routine inspection or how this could have happened.  My travel insurance is pursuing the matter.  On board the seats were relatively comfortable and legroom was decent.  The in-flight entertainment system worked and had current moves on the outbound flight.  On the return, I noticed that the touch screen didn't work at the seat I sat in and the flights were pretty full going and coming, so switching seats wasn't an option.  The flight attendants can come across as inattentive and aloof at times.  For example, at the beginning of the flight, they passed out yellow packets containing travel socks and a toothbrush with toothpaste to passengers.  They didn't finish distributing them and had not run out from what I could see and when I asked for one, I was ignored.  I also asked for water at one point when the flight attendant passed with the beverage cart because I needed to take medication.  She acknowledged me but had not returned within 15 minutes with my water.  The food was okay, but some of it was very spicy.  If you get heartburn easily, you should note this and perhaps bring antacid & snacks or request a dietary accommodation before your flight.The lavatory started out clean, but the last few hours of the flight, the floors were atrocious.  The flight attendants did not seem concerned since we were due to land shortly.  I agree with others that when you land in Addis Ababa it is very confusing and chaotic in the airport.  We were unsure of where to go for our connecting flight and I constantly listed for an also checked the monitor for the announcements.  I noticed a few times the monitor was incorrect and sometimes gates change.  We also had to go downstairs at Addis Ababa to board our connecting flight and there was no staff guiding passengers on where to line up once they reached the lower level, so the downstairs escalator kept bringing people carrying luggage down and those who were already on the first floor were blocking the escalators looking around wondering where they should go and nearly got trampled by everyone on the escalator behind them.  People were screaming for the people standing at the foot of the escalator to move, it was dreadful.  The connecting flight to SEZ was a bit more pleasant minus three passengers who were coughing, sneezing and hocking mucus the entire 3 hour flight.  It was so bad that the flight attendant asked everyone to close their eyes and cover their noses while she sprayed the entire cabin with disinfectant twice.  The connecting plan was smaller and a bit less spacious.  It still wasn't bad for a 3 hour flight and not horribly uncomfortable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/7d/52/04/divawidfevah.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divawidfevah,divawidfevah wrote a review Jan 2018,divawidfevah,"New York City, New York",210 contributions,54 helpful votes,Washington DC - Victoria,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r555954486-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Modern Planes, Customer Service Needs Improvement",Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Pleasant flight. Inconvenient schedule in both directions. At Addis Ababa airport , one is literally rushed off your feet to catch connecting flight plus the ridiculous indignity of having to get half undressed to AGAIN go through security checks . Is it really necessary in the middle of the night to have to take off shoes, belt & watch since one had already done that at the initial boarding.

"So lets start by saying that all the flight attendants were gorgeous! It was hard not to notice!! They all looked like ebony queens and spoke with such dignity and sophistication.

I was headed to Madagascar and one leg of the trip was to Addis Ababa where I would have a long layover. The crew did everything you'd expect them to do but they went a step further. Being 6' 3"", sometimes creates discomfort in economy class seats. They allowed me to stretch my legs in the back of the plane while they ate dinner. I inquired about injera (which was not served in economy) and they happily offered me some after discovering my affinity to it. I love injera so I gladly accepted. Injera takes some practice rolling right so they hand fed me on the plane because I was not getting the concept. They made me feel special in a way that I will never forget. I even asked them to take a photo with me as a keepsake for this experience and everyone posed in the back of the plane! This was one of... if not the best customer service experience I have ever had on an international flight. I can't wait to go back to Ethiopia to spend more time.

This is based on my experience the second time I used this airline when my bags could only be collected after several weeks. It appears they are yet to computerise their luggage handling, which is a serious issue.

"November 2017 I flew 4 segments with Ethiopian Airlines, Jeddah-Addis Ababa-Mekele, and Hargeisa-ADD-Nairobi. The flight out of Jeddah is known for many burquas boarding and very few getting off at the end of the flight. Then two flights on twin turboprops, both good experiences followed by the weirdest flight experience I have ever had! I had reserved a third-row window seat in coach, when I reached it, it was occupied. There was not a window at the location so it was no major problem to switch to the first seat across the aisle. Then I was asked to move over so a frail elderly man could have easier access. The flight attendants began checking tickets at that time and maybe 3 of 18 passengers in the front were in their ticketed seats! I learned from my other seatmate that people on this particular route took their assigned seating as just sort of a suggestion! After some time the crew just sort of threw up their hands so we could depart. This whole episode was just amusing and not a big problem and I developed a healthy respect for the ladies of the crew and their resilience in the face of chaos.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/0b/d1/f8/steven-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenP3559,Steven P wrote a review Jan 2018,Steven P,"Pueblo, Colorado",3812 contributions,402 helpful votes,Addis Ababa - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r555257406-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Cabin crews are great but, oh those passengers!",Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A friend and I flew Hong Kong to Entebbe in December 2017, with a transit stop at Addis Ababa. This airline needs to do a lot better, the flight crew seem uninterested and didn't even try to be pleasant; the food was poor and the toilet dirty. But the worst was the transit stop at Addis Ababa. We were literally herded down stairs to the 'transit lounge' by an officious airline staff member, to what could only be described as a cattle pen. It was extremely hot and the room was packed, nowhere to sit. I had anticipated getting a cold drink whilst in transit, but there was nowhere to get anything. A dirty water cooler with dirty used cups was all that was on offer and I wasn't going to touch that. The toilets were a makeshift arrangement in a container and also dirty. We ended up being in transit for over 3 hours, by which time I felt extremely unwell due to dehydration. When we finally boarded, late, we then sat on the tarmac for over an hour as a runway was out of use. I really felt I was going to pass out from heat and thirst. And to cap it all, when we did arrive at Entebbe, our luggage had been left in Addis. Fortunately it did turn up 24 hours later, but it added to a very unpleasant experience. Needless to say, I wont be travelling with this airline ever again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/45/da/dd/sandyam50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyAm50,SandyAm50 wrote a review Jan 2018,SandyAm50,"Nelson, New Zealand",16 contributions,17 helpful votes,Hong Kong - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r554868984-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Never fly Ethiopian Airlines,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My families experience with Ethiopian airlines has been nothing short of awful!
I have already filed a complaint about my flight from Washington DC to Harare via Addis. When I boarded the plane in Washington ( after a 2.5 hr delay due to the flight being severely over booked) I noticed my seat was wet. When I was finally able to get a flight attendants attention she notified me the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done, she then gave me a plastic bag to sit on for the 13 hours flight. This is nothing short of revolting and completely unsatisfactory that I had to sit in someone else urine for 13 hours, needless to say we were connecting in Addis for our flight to Harare, which once we boarded then sat on the runway for over an hour with no explanation. We arrived at our final destination 3 hours late.

On our return trip we were emailed our seat confirmations the day before we flew, yet when we arrived at the airport in Harare they told us we were flying standby from Addis to Washington, I have 2 small children, ages 5yrs and 2yrs, this was incredibly upsetting!! The Ethiopian Airlines representative assured me that we would be assigned seats in Addis and that all would be fine as he has emailed ahead to inform them. Well we left Harare and arrived in Addis (our flight was again delayed by and hour and a half). So we landed in Addis with a very short 1 hour window to get to someone to have our seats assigned, instead of the 2 hrs and 55 min lay over we were meant to have. While on the plane we asked the flight attendant what we should do as far as where we need to go to get seats assigned, she informed us that they would assign the seat at the gate to the next flight, however once inside the airport we went to the terminal to go to the gate and security told us that since we have no seats assigned we could not go to the gate that we have to go find a customer service agent. So we made our way through the airport to locate a customer service agent, which we had to wait in line for 30 mins, we finally got to the counter and were told that she could not help us that we had to go downstairs to ""transfers"". We got downstairs to only to face an ocean of people all who had been waiting over an hour with no service. Finally after another 30 minutes an Ethiopian representative took our passports without a word and left, he was gone for close to 20 minutes and finally came back with our passports and some paperwork, didn't give us any instructions, just handed them over and left. By this time we have missed our connecting flight on to Washington DC. We go through the paperwork and there is a transit visa and a hotel voucher for a hotel in the airport. We contacted the Hotel to be informed that they infect didn't not have enough beds for my family of 4, so we had to make alternate plans for accommodation as we had been given tickets to flight leaving the following night at 10:40pm. So we had 26 hrs in Addis. No one could tell us where our luggage was either.

We finally found a representative for another hotel that could accommodate our family of 4 and had to pay out of pocket for the room to the total sum of US$425. This infuriated me as we were not prepared to have to pay this expense!!!!

I am completely appalled by the lack of service provided by an airline that is a member of the star alliance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCBetts,NCBetts wrote a review Jan 2018,NCBetts,"Holly Ridge, North Carolina",5 contributions,5 helpful votes,Washington DC - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r554837229-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,"Horrible customer service, great flight.",Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First time flying with Ethiopian Airlines and may not be my last. Plane was excellent a Dreamliner one flaw with the Dreamliner is that it doesn’t have window blinds. Instead it is fitted that you can dim the window a bit like sunglasses, however as the sun was on my side of the plane and I had a window seat the side of my head was roasting even with it fully dimmed.
The leg room was good, food was just ok not as good as other airlines but I generally don’t eat airline food anyway. The TVs were large and had enough entertainment but not as many as other airlines, nevertheless there was plenty to keep me entertained. The staff were very friendly maybe not as slick as some carriers but perfectly fine.
So in summary maybe not the greatest service but perfectly fine but the big big thing is when I booked the flight was £310 return and the best cheapest carrier was £810 so it was a no brainier. To put it into perspective if another more established carrier was £30 more expensive I might go with them anything more than that Ethiopian will do me just fine.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerandJoA,JerandJoA wrote a review Jan 2018,JerandJoA,UK,214 contributions,47 helpful votes,Dublin - Los Angeles,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r554831990-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Well worth it ,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The title says it all.

Flight got changed 4 times, ended up 4 hours late, missed connecting flight and stuck in Ethiopia for 24 hours. Tried to book an earlier connecting flight out to Dubai and then change to SIA to Singapore but they claimed they were only able to give me a ""paper ticket"". How ridiculous.

There were so many passengers who were wailing. I honestly pitied the customer service but then again they placed us in a USD30 per night hotel as compensation. The hotel only gave us 1 bottle of water for our stay. If we needed more we had to pay.

"We were flying to Dar Es Salaam and in checking ticket prices the Business class tickets on Ethiopian Air were only 30% more than coach on other Airlines, rather than the 500% that’s common. Since my wife has a bad back, I thought it was reasonable to spend a little more to be sure she would be comfortable.

Ethiopian Air’s flight from Toronto to Addis had lay flat seats, attentive service, good food, and a comfortable environment. It was nicer than many full priced business class flights I’ve been on when traveling for my company. Given the level of service, and the price I paid, I considered the flight an incredible value.

Two things that were less than stellar: the choice of liquor was limited and the entertainment system had fewer choices than I’m used to. I will say that these are quibbles.

One important point: we arrived late into Addis and were transferred directly from our flight to our subsequent flight on a bus. Our luggage made it, and we saved time, but it was disconcerting. This allowed us to miss the Addis Airport, which is uncomfortable so in some senses it was a plus.

Overall, the service was better than the price suggested and I would highly recommend it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlockledge,jlockledge wrote a review Jan 2018,jlockledge,"Detroit, Michigan",76 contributions,36 helpful votes,Toronto - Addis Ababa,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729073-r554081806-Ethiopian_Airlines-World.html,Bargain Business Class,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
