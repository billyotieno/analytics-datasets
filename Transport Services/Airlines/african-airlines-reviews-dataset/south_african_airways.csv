"My husband and I were flying first on our honeymoon and the Flight attendant ordered me to move to another seat to accommodate a straight couple and their kids. I politely explained we were on our honeymoon and she didn’t care. She said, “no, I need you to move.” They didn’t even ask. She just forced us to separate. It was rude and felt targeted. And the straight family didn’t care at all. The whole thing was really hurtful and frustrating.

it started with boarding when my collectable Snap-On nail clipper was confiscated. I was embarrassed and made a spectacle of when the stewardess couldn't find a plastic spoon and cup. I was physically searched and my cabin bag was also searched without success. That was reported to the airline and they showed no care or response. Their service was terrible aside from my incident and you can never get their attention when required. The conduct was condoned by the head of the crew. It was a joke and they all laughed at my embarrassment and shame.

"I booked an economy flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg.

When we boarded the plane, the staff noticed that a family, with two small children, had not booked seats for the children.

As they were going to sit near me, a flight attendant asked if I would be willing to give my seat to one of the children.

I agreed, and after seated the same flight attendant asked again if I was willing to move. I said I was happy to do so to help the family, and then they moved me to business class!

I was impressed with their concern for the family’s comfort & travelling experience.

And appreciated their generous gesture of moving me to business class.

During the flight the where attentive, friendly and helpful. Overall, I had a great experience flying with SAA and will definitely consider booking with them again in the future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Healwithyoga,Jeanne Miriam Kirsten wrote a review Aug 2022,Jeanne Miriam Kirsten,,1 contribution,,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r854254694-South_African_Airways-World.html,Exceptional service from SAA staff,Date of travel: August 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Wish my partner had read SAA's reviews before making a booking with them last November 2021. Bookings had to be cancelled due to COVID 19 travel restrictions and quarantine.

Request for refund submitted online was never acknowledged. After walking into the Harare offices and complaining about lack of communication and failure to action request, I then got the Manager's email address (Winnie) who to my surprise doesn't respond to emails either!! What a shambolic system.....disgusting service to say the least. How can the office subordinates provide valued service if the Manager cant be bothered to respond to an email, a task that doesn't require more than 5 minutes of her ""precious"" time

"Flew back in the early 90s when they were a lot bigger. Brand new 747-400 was the aircraft flying out in economy in an overnight flight to Jan Smuts, as it was called back then.

I will always remember the female cabin crew on the outbound flight forcing my window blind down so I couldn't watch the sunrise, not once but twice they did it and scoffed at me something about waking up other passengers. Then when they came around with their hot wet flannels I got mine thrown at me because I was in the window seat, or maybe it was because I pissed them off for bringing light into the cabin earlier?

"Do not fly with South African Airways especially if you are outside of South Africa. I have been booking trips from New York and they are impossible to contact and now they have made it impossible to pay for tickets.

They closed their U.S 1-800 customer service number during COVID so the only way to contact them is through the South African number. They aren't on WhatsApp so I have to pay foreign call fees every time I talk to customer service. I called them regarding an unused ticket that should receive credit towards a new flight. Every time I talked to them the connection was terrible and they would tell me something different or would tell me to call back at a different time. I finally got to someone that tried to help but she said it would be an $85 fee in order to use the ticket credit. The new ticket only cost about $105. This is ridiculous since most airlines these days are not charging a cancellation fee for using flight credit. I decided to go with it anyway to just get the whole thing over with, but then the payment link they sent me didn't work and they told me that the only way I'd be able to pay for the ticket is to go to the airport with the credit card.

I've reserved tickets with South African Airways multiple times in the past and most of the time their site has errors when you try to put in credit card info. I've called before and provided the card information in order to pay for the ticket and everything went fine. Now they're saying that they've changed their policy and providing card info over the phone is fraud. So they've literally made it impossible to fly with them since I can't pay for the ticket.

Horrible customer service (the people on the phone were nice but incapable of doing anything helpful because of company policy) and impossible for international travelers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500grahaml,Graham L wrote a review Feb 2022,Graham L,,7 contributions,2 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r829260350-South_African_Airways-World.html,Impossible for International Passengers,Date of travel: November 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

SAA announced that they were opening bookings to the public on the 6th of September and the public who had vouchers from tickets that were booked near the beginning of the pandemic could use these to pay towards new bookings Noel You also announced the process of booking a new flight and selecting the ‘pay layer’ option then sending an email to designated email address to start the process of redeeming the voucher towards the new flight booking. I was amongst one of the first to make a booking on Monday and then sent the email the same day but I still have not heard from the EMD team till today. I then realized on Thursday that the current booking I made on Monday lapses after 72hr if it has not been paid for. So I made yet another booking and sent another email to the team but this still has not been sorted. The price of the flight has now increased and my second booking is about to lapse tomorrow because it hasn’t been paid for. I’ve spent over R200 on airtime contacting the call centre with no resolution. It would be unfortunate to think that you only want people to pay for bookings and you don’t want to help people who made bookings prior to the pandemic. I hope they have a serious look at the redemption process especially because it is time sensitive.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InternationalBelle25,Babalwa M wrote a review Sep 2021,Babalwa M,,1 contribution,,Harare - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r809386655-South_African_Airways-World.html,SAA not helping customers with vouchers with flight bookings,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I along with another family were supposed going to Zimbabwe Victoria Falls from NYC on April 2, 2020. We have paid about $3000 for our tickets. The airline grounded all the international flights at that time. When we asked for refund or a voucher for future travel all they offered us was to use our tickets for the same trip until June 29 2020 which was too close, and impossible for us to use. So in a nutshell they basically stole &3000 from us.

Took my money £450 then cancelled flight 2 days later when SA border closed. Remonstrated with SA rep. as I wanted money back. Turkish Airlines had done so with cancelled flight few days earlier. Explained my mobile phone had been stolen and I had no way of contacting anyone for flight home. Rep. merely shrugged her shoulder - couldn't give a damn. Told me to contact 'customer services' which I did when returned home eventually. What a joke - offering a credit flight within 2 years but can't actually speak to anyone. Some customer service.. I WANT MY MONEY BACK AS I AM ENTITLED TO. I will continue to discredit you until this happens.

"Absolutely terrible experience - where other companies are doing their best in the times we are living in - South African Airways cancelled all their international flights without warning.  The airline knew this was happening but still allowed me to board a flight from Mauritius to Johannesburg - knowing that my onward flight to London was cancelled.  Once in Johannesburg was told flight was cancelled, and then told you are on your own.  Transit lounge filled with passengers trying to get other flights.  SAA did not assist any passenger.  There was no water available or food.My inbound flight - the plane should have been sanitised but when I opened my tray table it had scraps of food from the previous passenger.

"We’ve had a great experience with SAA customer service during the Corona pandemic. They’ve agreed for us to rebook our ticket free of charge. We booked through an online agent and should have used them to rebook the ticket but we cannot get hold of them (just a message saying their offices are closed). We emailed SAA to say “Help!” and they’ve agreed to suspend our booking so we don’t count as a no show, so we can rebook anytime before 30th April, to give us an opportunity to get hold of our booking agent. They’ve responded to our emails within an hour and been very accommodating. Remarkable considering what a busy time this must be for them!

Incidentally, they also were awesome prebooking a seat for us with a basinet, even though the ticket was booked through a third party. Phone was answered within seconds and had email confirmation through shortly afterwards.

"SA 191 celebrated a brand new aircraft. Was 30 minutes late into Mauritius. Gave all gate personnel flower garlands at the gate in Mauritius. Left M 1,5 hours late. We missed connecting fligts to Zurich and Stockholm in Johannesburg due to celebration and late arriving SA 191. No excuses what so ever from SA. The flight staff were nonchalant and out of focus. The service was bad. We asked for help with connecting flights when we realized that we were going to miss the flight to Zurich. Arrived in Johannesburg at 20:00 local time. Our flight to Zurich was at 20:20 local time. We were told by SA 191 staff that we were going to be picked up at the arriving gate and taken to our new flight to Zurich. Great. BUT no one were waiting for us at the gate and no one took us to the connecting flight. We were running through the buildings and arrived at  the new gate when our connecting flight were reversing out from the gate. Could not stop them. We had no excuses what so ever from SA or from the flight staff at SA 191. No help what so ever. We got help at Johannesburg airport and went later on th Munich and then to Stockholm. But sitting on the worsed possible seats in both flights. In stead of reserved prepayed good seats in original flights.Our experience with SA and SA 191 was very bad.

"The flight wasn’t full which considering the crew was a good thing. The staff were abrupt to the point of rudeness. They don’t answer the call bell when it’s pressed. This resulted in my husband going to get us bottles of water, only to be told by the crew he wasn’t allowed to walk around the cabin drinking water, but what chose did we have when the crew don’t answer the call button. As for the meal service that was chaotic beyond belief. My husband always orders a special meal, so he was ok, however a women across the aisle fro us has ordered a special meal as she was lactose intolerant, could they find it! No!,, however when dishing out the meals, the people in the rows in front and behind me had all be served, I had been overlooked, when I pressed the call button, surprise, surprise no one came. In the end my husband went to find out what was happening and was abruptly rushed aside and when a flight attendant did come to see me I was told to wait!
It’s an 11:5 hour flight over night, the crew were not seen walking around and offering soft drinks during the night and as mentioned earlier trying to get service was hard work.

I have sat on more comfortable park benches than the seats in economy.

"I recently travelled to Maputo via Johannesburg on business. The service on board from Heathrow to Johannesburg was spoiled by the quality of food and drink, which fell far below what I would expect in business class. The food was basic and less than generous. Asking for a whiskey and ginger ale I was told there was no ginger ale on board. The miniature bottle of whiskey I was offered was some obscure brand I had never seen before. The advertised Jonnie Walker was not present.
On my way back I had the very unpleasant experience of the SAA business lounge - this is not a business lounge by any stretch of the imagination. The service was poor, there was no generosity, very little food and very little alcohol. The service was poor and boarder line belligerent, note Jack Daniels is not whiskey! Opting for a Gin and Tonic I left most of it as the glass smelt of food.
The flight back had the same issues, this time no spirits on board and a poor selection of wines. A South African traveller made her views regarding the choice of wine very clear. On a positive note the cabin crew are clearly doing their best under exceptional poor circumstances. I am sorry to report that I will not travelling with SAA anytime soon - SAA are still charging business class prices with none of the business class service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m35245po,Stuart B wrote a review Mar 2020,Stuart B,"Bristol, United Kingdom",14 contributions,7 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r749711423-South_African_Airways-World.html,SAA - No longer business class,Date of travel: March 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is the worst airline experience I have ever had. I was traveling to Zambia with my aunt and uncle. I am actually shocked to find some good reviews here, although I noticed that most of them are for short distance (local flights).1. The flight attendants are lazy and rude. One of the flight attendants was rude to my aunt for asking for a wine after he gave her some juice. I also heard a flight attendant lie to a woman about the meal options, they had beef, chicken and vegetarian. The flight attendant ran out of chicken by the time she got to the lady, when the lady asked for chicken the flight attendant rudely told her that there were only 2 options, she could have easily asked for chicken from the other flight attendants. 2. I was profiled for wearing a name brand coat, when we were boarding our flight to Lusaka, one of the bag handlers insisted I have my carry on checked in because they were afraid the cabin would run out of space, surprisingly my aunt and uncles carry on cases which were larger were not checked in. We get to Lusaka and my bag had been ransacked, and of course some my items were stolen. 3. The stainless still cutlery is cool but it doesn’t count if the food is mediocre. 4. The planes are old with worn out seats and malfunctioning TVs. Our trip was over 17 hours from Johannesburg to Washington DC, we were seated in a 4 seat middle row on a packed plane, it was the most uncomfortable flight experience. The lady in front of me sat on a broken seat that was in recline mode through out the flight, it could not straightened, I believe that’s a safety risk. I see exactly why this airline is constantly in need of financial bailouts, there is a severe lack of management and the service is horrible on all levels from the ground people at the Johannesburg airport to the flight attendants.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cruiser708123,Cruiser708123 wrote a review Mar 2020,Cruiser708123,,1 contribution,,Washington DC - Lusaka,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r749023100-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst Airline: Beware of the SAA Thieves Handling Bags,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Cons - their customer service is appalling, never return phone calls even if you lucky enough to actually get to speak to someone, emails remain unanswered, but that’s just Office staff. The food is unappetising and unappealing. It’s so difficult to order special meals if you have a medical reason. The cabin staff are mostly mediocre, now and then they get a service champ.

"Flight was good with nice meals. In flight entertainment a bit disappointing as films very limited.
Paid for seat reservations going out which I find annoying but as I was travelling with two children thought it best.
Coming back we booked in and noticed we were not seated with the children. Went through the process of changing seats so we were sitting al, together and made a note of new seat numbers. Imagine our surprise and annoyance when we got to the air port and found the changes hadn’t registered. The agent said we should have printed boarding pass but this not possible as game lodge.

"Jan 1 Auckland-Perth uneventful AirNZ. SAA PER-JHB - old Airbus A340-300, very cramped seating, tiny screens BUT.... . entertainment system broken across most seats so crew had to go ""manual""for safety briefing. Reset and still not all going. Tried to reboot our section 5 times. 10 hour flight PER-JHB. Nothing. Crew bumping into aisle seats all night. Horror story.  Then flight JHB-VFA in near-new A330  - great. Then sent an A320 , half the capacity of A330 return a week later. They had to transfer overflow a later BA flight back to JHB. Just made our SAA connection to Durban but our baggage didn't make it to Durban with us. 10 days later from CPT-HDS aircraft hel for ""a catering issue"". Finally left gate 40 minutes late and then sat on taxiway for anothter 40 minutes. No announcements. Just sat there, engines running. Return flight JHB-PER checkin agent was trying explain we would have to uplift our bags in PER and go to domestic terminal for PER-AKL flight..... seriously. We had to explain PER and AKL were in different countries to a front-line SAA employee. Then same issue with crew on JHB-PER .... bump... bump...bump... but at least entertainment system worked this time .

I might consider other airlines in the future if possible. There is no internet inflight. However, they had inflight TV with some movies (none of those movies caught my interest because they were mostly frightening). Their food was alright but not the best option (few vegetarian options).

"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. CRIMINALS.

My wife and I were returning from our honeymoon, and were robbed as we returned back to the US. My advice - and what I'll personally do next I visit Africa (which is a truly amazing continent) - is to pay more to avoid South African Aiways, at all costs.

We had checked our large bags and had the appropriate amount of carry-on's (which we did / had no issue for 6 other flights during the trip) and two employees near the gate begged us and forced us to gate-check our bags. We had valuables in all, and so we had to take a risk with one- unfortunately, that resulted in us losing $700 worth of apparel and goods.

The worst part is the fact that we had the appropriate amount / size of carry-on luggage, and the employees effectively intimidated us and forcefully demanded a bag -- commenting that there was no room left on the packed flight (re: overhead space). Without exaggeration- my wife and I had and empty seat next to us and ENTIRE OVERHEAD BINS EMPTY - completely empty - for the entire flight. Yet, we were told there was absolutely no overhead room on this packed flight.

As soon as we sat down for takeoff, we knew we were *screwed*. While we did not let if ruin the most incredible honeymoon ever, we were very upset and disappointed when we found our bag plundered upon arrival. An absolute joke and pathetic company- which makes the stigma even worse in an environment known to be dominated by corruption and crime. A true shame.

All I can hope for now, is to help others with this review- avoid SA Airways however possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenvM7606KB,Steven V wrote a review Feb 2020,Steven V,,3 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r746960740-South_African_Airways-World.html,The WORST; Avoid at all costs,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Cheese and biscuits provided in addition to a small but great dessert and a choice of three entrees for dinner whilst breakfast was also another hot meal. Metal cutlery was provided.

"Run away from booking with the company. They have no respect for customers. I had booked a flight from Perth to Johannesburg that was supposed to depart at 11.45pm and arrive at 4am the next day. Just a month before, they have decided to change the schedule by MORE THAN 9 HOURS. As a result, I would have to change my connecting flight and spend the night in Johannesburg. SSA has taken NO responsibility for this change. I asked to be compensated, or get my hotel paid, but they don’t care. In the EU or the US, they would have to provide me with 600$ compensation because any normal person caring for customers consider this unacceptable. This is what SSA does:
- Don’t give compensation
- Don’t provide accommodation for the extra night they have created
- Unable to give information on how much would be refunded for the 1 flight that got reschedule!! They told me they could not calculate that and I had to write an email and I would get a reply in 34 working days!! I was appalled. After sending me through 4 different services of course.
- Unable to provide a spot on a different flight
I am a frequent traveler, and this is by far the worse customer service I have seen in my life. They actually signed the Montreal convention by which they are compelled to cover the damages caused by the schedule change, but they do not respect their engagement. They scam their customers instead. They said they announced the change more than 30 days before the flight so they don’t owe me anything. Yes, 34 days before. Unbelievable. They said they could only fully refund the tickets, including the way in which I don’t want to change. Do they really expect me to find a flight just a month before?? When the prices have double or tripled?? Especially when they are the only company connecting these 2 cities and the other flights have a step over in Doha and 3 times longer. But they don’t care and they don’t do anything. I strongly discourage anyone to book with this company, unless you want to have your travel plans completely screwed at the last minute.

"This morning I arrived at Heathrow to discover that despite my suitcase having a lock and a locked strap on it, the baggage handlers at OR Tambo airport had ransacked it and stolen items, including sentimental ones. I had thought that SAA had managed to control this kind of a thing, but clearly this is not the case.
So, to all passengers intending to use SAA, I suggest that you try some other company, or wrap your case in many layers of plastic. Better still, fill it with snakes.

"I broke my ankle in two places, and had to leave for surgery in Accra, Ghana immediately.  My daughter bought a one way flight for Jan 12, 2019. She wanted to buy bulk head seat for me, which would have cost $30 online.  She called customer service, and was informed that she can get it for free within 24 hours of the flight, while checking in online.  We tried that, and were unable to.  We called again, and were told it could only be done at the airport counter during check in/baggage drop.  We got to the airport very early, and were told that we had to pay $40 cash to get a bulk head seat. Although we protested because we could have done it for $30 online if the agent hadn't told us to wait and get it free while checking-in online. I went ahead and paid $40.  I was wheeled to the plane and told the bulk head seats were all full, and given a regular aisle seat.  This was unacceptable, as I needed the space to stretch my broken ankle, and we had paid $40 for that seat.I would like to be recompensed immediately, as I was in incredible discomfort during the whole trip, and I had paid for the bulk head seat, which I never received. If the bulk head seats were already full, why take our $40?? Why didn't the customer service agent we spoke to just make us pay for it to guarantee a comfortable seat for me?

"My husband and I were on our honeymoon to South Africa and had the absolute worst experience with this airline, essentially ruining the last portion of our honeymoon.
We wanted to extend our stay one more day, called the airline to change our flight and this was the beginning of our issues. The rep who booked our new flight recorded the wrong credit card number and instead of notifying us- they canceled our flight back home. It wasn't until a few hours before our flight that we realized this, which sent us into a panic.

We called the customer service line several times without resolution. We were placed on hold for hours without anyone picking up the line. We were finally then told a ""team leader"" or supervisor would give us a call with an answer or to help us within the hour. No one ever called us back. All we received out of this was extremely rude and dismissive individuals who didn't have an answer or couldn't help with anything. We missed our morning safari trying to figure out how to fix what should've been a very simple situation. They also charged us double the price compared to what another representative had quoted us on, and this airline refused to honor what another rep had quoted.

I rarely write bad reviews, but I truly don't want anyone else experiencing what we experienced through this process. So do yourselves a favor and DO NOT BOOK THIS AIRLINE. I'm unfortunately not surprised they are going bankrupt. Also do your research and look up recent news on this airline.

"South African Airways has finally delivered the new A350-900 Airbus for the JFK- Johannesburg route. The plane is amazing. It is quieter, and faster than the old A340-600 workhorse that previously flew this route. We flew economy and had as much room as Delta Comfort plus at half the price. You are able to fully recline the seat without bothering the person seated behind you. There are even footrests. the power plugs and USB ports were all full functional and the three, three, three configuration is an improvement over the two, four, two arraignment in that there is one less middle seat per row.

"With no computer to check in at the appointed hour, we tried to use the concierge's at our hotel but could not do it!  It was very frustrating.  I called the airline the next morning and was advised to try again using my smart phone and it worked!  The problem with checking-in on line had been to do with the strike that SAA had staged the previous day.  It caused a lot of disruption to services. I had never checked in by phone before and not being able to check in and get a seat assignment the previous evening caused a lot of stress.  I then suffered a very bad migraine during the night which was not a conducive prelude to a long flight.  However, we were lucky and got a spare seat between us and I was able to sleep!

Things to look out for are the in the Nigerian airport. The ""trolly"" collectors will approach you in the airport and demand a payment for their assistance in helping your bag of the conveyor belt. They will use this opportunity also to try and get you to pay to skip the line.

"Flying from Johannesburg to London Heathrow, we had requested a gluten-free dinner for my wife. When this was served, we noticed that the biscuits to accompany the cheese were labelled 'Wholewheat.' Checking the ingredients confirmed that the main ingredient was, in fact, wheat. This could have had very serious consequences. We summoned the flight attendant; she shouted down the length of the plane to a more senior colleague, 'A woman here is making a complaint.' The senior colleague marched up, snatched the biscuits and the wrapper, and walked off without a word of apology (or replacement).On returning home, we wrote to South African Airways UK office. As we had received no reply nearly four weeks later, I again wrote to South African Airways UK office. I received a reply from their 'Customer Care Executive' saying that their catering manager in Johannesburg was in the process of contacting their caterers, Skychefs, and would contact me again when they had had a response. Five weeks later, we have heard nothing.If this had involved a nut allergy, there could have been a fatality. Mistakes do happen, but apart from serving food that was potentially dangerous, South African Airways failed on several counts:1) the behaviour of the flight attendant shouting something that was untrue down the       plane was totally unacceptable2) the more senior flight attendant rudely snatching the offending food without     apology was even more unacceptable3) failure to answer our complaint after nine weeks demonstrates a total failure of     Customer Care Department in not addressing a very serious error on their part.I hope that management see this review and deign to reply in a timely and adequate manner.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyanddavid536,wendyanddavid536 wrote a review Jan 2020,wendyanddavid536,"Solihull, United Kingdom",2067 contributions,1545 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r739086239-South_African_Airways-World.html,Eat on South African Airways....and You Might Die!,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

After boarding the two flight attendants closed the curtain (plane was too small for business or first class) and proceeded to socialise for about 20 minutes. Food was then served in this order. Starter (salad and pudding) - followed about 20 minutes later by main meal and then about 20 minutes after that the roll arrives!. There was just enough time for the drinks cart before we descended.

"The flight from New York to Johannesburg is over 14 hours. It is a challenging flight. SAA makes an effort to make this as pleasant as possible. First the staff is friendly and seeks to meet the needs of the travelers. Two meals are provided and one snack, a sandwich. You can ask for that sandwich or water whenever you might need it.

However, the main purpose of this review is not about the flight itself, but what happened next. I arrived with just barely enough time to catch my next SAA flight. However due to some confusion on my part, I ended up missing my flight. I was traumatized, but the kind people at SAA worked me through it. First they tried to get me on a flight with another airline, but for some reason they couldn’t make it work. So they put me up for the night at a nice nearby hotel and paid for three meals and booked me to leave the next day. They were very kind and patient when I was obviously distressed.

"I was very apprehensive about flying SAA due to its bad reputation as portrayed by the media and consumers, however,I bit my tongue and booked my flights with them.

On the day of departure, everything went well with my online check in and bag drop. There was a slight delay with the flight due to late passengers however we set off and landed safely. One thing I loved about the airline is the gorgeous and friendly staff. Their food is, however, not the best I've had on a flight and that's disappointing. Either than that, it's a fair service.

"If you need a last minute flight for a reasonable price then ok book it. Just remember you get what you pay for. My flight to Ghana was decent however, the flight back was a nightmare. Apparently the airlines overbooked for the flight by about 60 ppl. They allowed everyone to stand in line for 2 1/2 hours before telling them they would need to fly out the next day. People begin to yell and demand explanations. One woman even fainted in line! They only accepted individuals who checked in online but the site was also down during the day 😣.

There was water leaking from the aircon and the flight attendants had to lay blankets in the aisles to absorb the water !!!

The flight was really fine. The plane was not so full so I had two seats to myself and could sleep the food was mediocre and not good. Very basic and some odd choices.

"At least the flight was safe. You do have to take that into consideration. It was also affordable. However, compared to the other airlines like Delta, Jetblue, etc. this airline was pathetic.
Their website says that most of their fleet has updated planes. I took 4 flights and only one had USB ports in the seats. When you are flying 14.5 hours, this is a necessity. No air vents so you are at the mercy of the plane as a whole. Let's just say I was hot... I asked the stewardess twice and nothing happened. My TV volume never worked and nor did my seatmate. This was common as I traveled with 6 people. The only thing the stewardess did was reset the system which is logically not going to help. Their plugs are fried. The food was mediocre but at least they served a few times. Planes are small considering so it is hard to get comfortable.

"This was our first experience with SAA.  The flight was the first leg of a return to the USA after a wonderful vacation in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  It started off on the wrong foot when a last minute equipment change caused the wife and I ending up in different parts of the cabin.  Her seat was suddenly by the exit door, galley and lav.  Not where you really want to spend 10+ hours and nowhere close to what we booked and planned.The great news for us was the Chief Purser n the flight (Ms. Gibbs) was a superstar for customer service.  Once the boarding was mostly complete, she was able to reseat the better half right next to me.  She then proceeded to provide some of the best service to us, and all the other passengers nearby that I've seen in many years.  What started out as a very sour start became one of the best flying experiences ever.  On our trip we flew Business Class on Lufthansa and United in addition to this flight on SAA.  The SAA experience blew away the competition - not even close.  Thanks to Ms. Gibbs and all the SAA personnel we met on the trip.Note to the aircraft schedule planners - last minute equiipment changes are a headache for passengers AND crew.

"My wife and I have been flying SAA for the last 25 years or so and have never, repeat never had cause to complain. I have heard of reports of dissatisfaction including from friends siting old aircraft but I have yet to experience this. Their Voyager with free Companion Ticket is an excellent offering, allowing a companion to fly at approx 25% of normal all inclusive ticket price. Using the Companion ticket offering has allowed us to travel business class. What an excellent service! The most up to date seating with lie flat compartmentalised beds in a 1-2-1 layout, just like Emirates. I loved being addressed by name and discussing the wine and food before ordering. However I have found their admin a bit challenging on occasions and their website has room for improvement. I do hope that they get over their maladministration and that business rescue does just that, otherwise I fear my next companion ticket for 2020 may fly away.

"I travelled on South African airlink and South African Airline Express to and from Gaborone - Botswana, (25 Nov, return flight on 29 Nov) the worst experience ever, flights are never on time and what's even worse is to stay for more than 40 minutes in the aircraft waiting to move and travel and catch-up the other flight u have so if u have connection in Johannesburg (return flight specially) make sure to have min of 3 hours stopover to avoid running like a crazy in Joburg airport.
The staff us rude and were giving stupid excuses on why we are not flying back to Johannesburg.. as a side note, the whole flight was booked on Qatar Airways but this flight precisely was operated by SA local airlines. Book with Botswana Airlines I believe you will have a better experience and less delays.
I do NOT recommend flying with this company.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alalshaw,Alae wrote a review Dec 2019,Alae,"Amman, Jordan",137 contributions,170 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Gaborone,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r733024177-South_African_Airways-World.html,Always delayed flights,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flown on SA453 today from JHB to DBN(10am)
Considering the tough times faced by the airline they excelled today.
The cabin crew went out of their way to ensure the comfort of passengers. Basically the crew tried to do something out of nothing as the airline is cash strapped and is in bad shape due to various factors. The pilot was phenomenal. He managed to keep the aircraft under control as there was a severe storm in DBN. His experience and skill was clearly notable. We asu passengers keep on critising the airline but nobody talks about their sparkling safety record and the amount of seasoned pilots that is in their arsenal.

I say SAA has huge potential and as a fellow South African will support this airline back to winning its ways again.

What surprised me is that the crew's attitude was outstanding especially considering the tough economic times and turmoil they(SAA) are facing, in fact nobody would even notice the predicament the airline is facing as the great service from the staff was superb.

Let's get this right SAA. Us South Africans will stand together and support you. Let's get back to winning ways again and earn that respect back.

Well done and keep It up!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nithesh_1,Nithesh_1 wrote a review Dec 2019,Nithesh_1,,19 contributions,56 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Durban,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r732464939-South_African_Airways-World.html,Great Flight ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On the internal flight I had an extremely rude man in front of me who shut my window (which I was looking out of) and then reclined his seat fully....hardly necessary on a 1.1/2 hour flight.

"This was my first time flying SAA. Bought my ticket just a few days prior to my travel due to the fact that I was traveling to my mother's funeral, so granted the price was a high. I booked my flight through the SAA website. SAA had me fly United from Austin TX to IAD (Dulles) where I got the SAA plane. So, as much as SAA allows 2 checked bags free, United only allows 1 checked bag and $100 for a second bag! And thus my frustration commenced. So since I had brought 2 bags to the airport with me.....I paid the $100. The united flight was fine, the flight attendants were polite which is my normal experience with United as I fly them a lot for business. After my 5 hour layover at Dulles airport, I boarded my SAA flight. The first thing that struck me was that it was so dated which made it seem kinda dirty too. I was disappointing but I let it go, I just needed to get to my destination. Then it came to the food/drink service. The flight attendants were not very welcoming to the point were they were actually outright rude to some passengers. I actually saw one flight attendant actually roll her eyes at a passenger! Seriously?! It doesn't cost anything to even just smile when offering a drink to a passenger! And speaking of drinks, when they initially offer you a drink, all they say is ""would you like something to drink? we have juice and water"" they don't tell you that they actually have wine (limited as that choice was) as an option. For a 16 hour flight, I'd say that is important to know! The food also left a lot to be desired. Stale rolls and iffy beef stew that ended up making 3 people sick to their stomach. Oh and to top it all off...they went on strike while I was in Lusaka. I had to hear that on the news as I sat in a bank lobby one afternoon just a few days before I was due to travel back to the US. There was no email or any other form of communication directly to me from SAA,  essentially leaving me in a state of panic as to how I was going to get back home. In conclusion, I will never be flying SAA again. Back to Emirates and Ethiopian Airlines when traveling to Zambia.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/9e/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamarah136,Tamara H wrote a review Dec 2019,Tamara H,,2 contributions,,Austin - Lusaka,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r731816588-South_African_Airways-World.html,Never flying SAA again!,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was one of the best flights I have ever taken, better than Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and BA. We travel one or twice a year on Holidays to Europe and now the USA. All these flights are over night and long distance.This flight was the best I have ever taken.
First the seats are better quality, leather Recaro , and are also not so tightly packed, SAA I understand gives you a bit more space between seats.
Second the service over the night, stewards were coming around with drinks and refreshments right through the night instead of disappearing after dinner. Very attentive to your needs.
Third the food was super, wife had the Asian Veterinarian, was realy good.
It is a pity that SAA gets a lot of bad press but operationally on this flight they do a good job. Lets hope they continue to do so.

"In July 2019 travelling to catch a BA flight to London we sat on the ground in Lusaka for 2hrs and then rerouted via Blantyre to reposition an engineer to fix another aircraft that had gone technical.

"In September of this year I returned from a lovely holiday in South Africa, which was a bucket list trip, to see the 'Big Five'. I saw that and more and enjoyed it all immensely. But on the return flight, for some reason, the screens in the seat back weren't working. What this actually turned into was a 1 hour delay on the tarmac to try and fix the fault, which couldn't be fixed. Not only that, but on a 9 to 10 hour flight there was no music, no movies or TV shows; no entertainment at all. Also, the flight attendants were not in visual range for any of the passengers in my section to see the safety talk, and; you guessed it; not able to see it on the seat back screens. I was extremely disappointed that I wouldn't be able to watch any movies as I don't sleep well on planes and this was a long flight. When I received an email from South African Airways customer service, I was happy to have the incident acknowledged and very pleased to have an offer of compensation, which would have offset the extra parking charges I had to pay in Perth because the flight was delayed. Now, despite over 2 months wait and numerous email exchanges, I have still not received the compensation that was offered. All I can say is - terrible customer service - and poor maintenance on the planes. If that system fails, I wonder what other systems could fail?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzi8au,suzi8au wrote a review Dec 2019,suzi8au,"Perth, Australia",3 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r731690988-South_African_Airways-World.html,Poor Customer Service,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Food quite nice, better than many ,crisp linen tablecloths ,& wine excellent. Cabin crew efficient & friendly. I would choose this any time over BAs truly awful herringbone config.

"We chose this nonstop but long flight so as to get it over with quickly. Probably still believe it, but it's a long time (15-16 hours).

Lunch was served immediately after takeoff, then they dined the lights for sleeping.

"I wish we had been warned, and so I am writing this as a warning for others.  Our family flew from NY to Johannesburg on SA airways in Business Class.  The plane is configured so that there is no room to put anything at your feet.  The attendants made us put everything, including my purse, in the overhead compartments.  When we landed and I went to buy a bottle of water in the airport, I discovered my wallet was missing.  Fortunately, my husband and I had split up all the US $ we had brought for tips for a month of safari, but it still meant we lost $2500 and all my credit cards, with no recourse.  The airline couldn't have cared less.  We subsequently learned from another pilot in Africa that on the long overnight flights from NY and Hong Kong, this happens all the time, and it is presumed that the thieves are airline staff.  I also have a South African friend in Cape Town whose husband lost a brand new very expensive camera that he had checked, so things are no safer in your checked luggage.

"It's nice to fly Business Class on a long haul flight and after repeated travel from the US to Singapore and China have gotten used to the many hours in a metal tube, so a 10 hour jaunt on SA shouldn't be that big of a deal. The problem begins with lateness in boarding and then another couple of extra hours on the tarmac at the fault of the airline. And a little wait is kind of a usual thing when you fly, but flight attendants ignoring passengers both as we waited and once in the air isn't a great start. Along with not great service, food or refreshment what I found one both the flight to DC and then back is that SA offers huge comforters, but keeps the cabin so warm that even without the cover, its nearly impossible to sleep with all the sweating.

"My husband and I flew with our 7 month old back to London overnight. The booking team had been amazing and facilitated a bassinet for our baby. We did our part as parents of a small person and had him asleep pre take off. We were never offered a baby seat belt and had to ask for the bassinet post take off. They placed the bassinet without any safety info or advice to us on its use. We had our meal and went to sleep. We got woken at roughly 1am being told to remove our baby from the bassinet because the seat belt sign was on. This sign had been on pretty much the entire time since the dinner service had wound up. The flight had been smooth with zero turbulence. We objected to having to potentially wake our son and hold him if the sign was being illuminated by error. The staff member insisted. We woke him .... then they turned the sign off 5 min later.... and back on again a further 5 min later. What could have been a glorious flight became hell with tensions raised between us and the staff member. What made it worse was that only the one member of staff had an issue with him being in the bassinet - none of the others thought it was a problem.

"On Wednesday 18 September we arrived at East London airport to book into flight SA480 to Oliver Tambo Airport and flight SA280 to Perth, Australia.

To our dismay the system refused to print my husband's boarding passe for the JHB-Perth leg of our flight.

The SAA staff member Rogas Polota tried everything. Then he called on colleague Kgaogelo Mabuya to assist. They asked for physical evidence of Derek's Australian visas.

Unfortunately Derek didn't have his letter with him so the help of Lundi Rula, ""the Visa Champion"" was enlisted. These three SAA or East London Airport officials helped my husband set up his laptop and find the relevant letter. In desperation Mr Rula contacted the Australian Embassy/Visa Zone and was able to solve the problem,. Derek's surname had been spelled with three ""L's"" -- HILLL. Without further ado the boarding pass was issued.

We are very grateful to Rogas Polota, Kgaogelo Mabuya and Lundi Rula. Without their help we would not have been able to visit our children and grandchildren who we had not seen for four years. Throughout the 45 minute ordeal they were friendly, positive, efficient and determined to solve the problem. They really did go the extra thousand miles for us.

The actual flight was very full, but the crew were friendly, helpful and efficient. The food was fine.

I sent this information to SAA and to the Manager of EL Airport. I hope that they have given recognition to Kgaogelo Mabuya, Rojas Rolota and Lundi Rula for excellent service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanhill41,Joan H wrote a review Dec 2019,Joan H,"Perth, Australia",6 contributions,2 helpful votes,East London - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r731310736-South_African_Airways-World.html,Going the extra 8000 miles,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is the first review I have written that unfortunately is going to be just about all negative. I recently flew Perth to Johannesburg - on arrival into Johannesburg I was informed that my flight from Johannesburg to Durban had been cancelled. I was offered a flight on Mango - a budget carrier as a replacement which I refused. I had booked and payed for business class and Mango does not have business class. I was told there would be no refund on my South African unused flight !! I had to basically have an argument with the South African airlines staff member who eventually booked me on a British Airlines flight in business class.
Then the strikes hit just a few days before I was due to fly home. I didn’t know if the flights were going to be operating but went to the airport and all was fine. Panic over !
My flight from Johannesburg to Perth was so disappointing with the only good thing about it was that is was a quite new plane, not like the old clapped out one I flew on 2 years ago. The service was appalling, the dinner was basically inedible as was the breakfast - who wants to wake up to half cold coffee, watered down orange juice and a bowl of soggy cornflakes. And to really top it off there was a toddler in the middle row next to me who screamed and ran around.....why do airlines allow toddlers in business class at all ?????
The chief purser then, just before landing came through the cabin wearing white gloves and proceeded to thank everyone for flying with South African but it was the comments he was making that really baffled me “ Please fly with us again as I love your money” and “tell your friends to fly with us we need their money”
I just didn’t think these comments were at all professional.
I will not fly with SAA ever again.......",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynneMoore1961,LynneMoore1961 wrote a review Dec 2019,LynneMoore1961,"Hamilton, New Zealand",27 contributions,26 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r730535575-South_African_Airways-World.html,Well below expected standard !!!,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The check in and loading was all fine just normal really friendly welcome, we got to our seats and alas we had two arrogant people sitting in front who already had their seats reclined, the seating on the A330,300 is to out licking for a couple there are just two seats by the window and four in the middle, My wife and I are both short so leg room wasn't a real problem but still not really comfortable. I had only a short nap on the 10 hour flight even though I had not slept the night before due to work. The staff were pleasant and the food just OK nothing special. I found the aircraft very noisy considering its a fairly new aircraft I was surprised. At breakfast the arrogant people in front still had their seats reclined the cabin stewardess wouldn't wake them to get them to move their seats upright they did later reluctantly.

"This was the first leg on an international flight path to Europe and the baggage allowance was 23kg.I had 2 kg over that allowance and was willing to pay overweight for the two extra kilos, as would be the practice with other airlines, but SAA charge you a full oversize bag, not for the actual overweight which is very sharp practice. They don’t take into account the money you have paid for the regular baggage allowance, so they make you pay twice.
After refusing to do that, I was asked to remove 2 kg from my checked luggage and no leeway was given until the bag weighed 23 kg. Once again, if you want to annoy your customers, this is the way to do it.
I travel internationally quite frequently and I have encountered two behaviours with other airlines in the past: Either they turn a blind eye to low overweight amounts like in this case, or you pay for the additional kilos not covered by the allowance.
SAA has shown itself to be an airline where the customer does not come first, so I will be using other carriers in future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlanB365,PlanB365 wrote a review Dec 2019,PlanB365,"Dublin, Ireland",3 contributions,,Port Elizabeth - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r729950657-South_African_Airways-World.html,Lousy customer unfriendly baggage policy,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My husband and I took advantage of the special deal South African Airways was offering for flights between October and December, which was half or more cheaper than flights with other airlines. Although we were not looking forward to the 17-hour flight from Washington, DC to Johannesburg, then a 2-hour flight to Cape Town, we thought we could weather it. We did survive the flight, but it was undoubtedly the most uncomfortable flight in economy class that we have ever had.

The primary discomfort was lack of leg room, which seemed to be less than any other airline we've flown. Even worse, when passengers seated in front of us reclined, we couldn't reach down to get what we had stowed under those seats. In essence, we felt trapped and had to sit sideways the entire flight. I realize that Economy Class is what it is, but this was the worst we have experienced in terms of comfort.

I would advise potential basic economy class travelers to consider upgrading to the bulkhead seats for more legroom, although you risk being in a row with an infant in a bassinet.

Potential passengers should also know that when the plane stops in Accra, Ghana, passengers are not permitted to exit the plane. Standing in the aisles while in Accra is also not feasible because airline staff are passing back and forth to clean, gather blankets and headphones, and so forth. Officials from the Ghana airport also board the plane to check passports, then new passengers board for Cape Town. It was extremely frustrating to know we were on the ground but still trapped in the plane.

On the positive side, the food was generally good and served with good South African wine, although one beef meal after the stop in Ghana was full of fat and gristle in an unappetizing gravy. The plane was clean, and check-in and boarding were quick and easy.

On an ending note, don't be fooled by the airline's tease to bid on a business class seat up to 36 hours before your flight if there are business seats available. When the time came to bid, the minimum bid allowed was $1300, which is added to your original ticket price. A better method for the airline would be to hold a lottery to award up to 2 business class upgrades, but then the airline wouldn't make its additional money for unsold seats, would it?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteYB,AYB60 wrote a review Nov 2019,AYB60,,2 contributions,,Washington DC - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r729913868-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Uncomfortable for 17 hours over, 18 hours back",Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently used SAA to fly from Perth to Johannesburg. I had previously used Qantas from Johannesburg to Sydney then Melbourne. The pros: comfortable seats. Cons: the food was bland. Looked and tasted like something I made when I had just started learning how to cook. The cherry on the top is that the flight attendants seemed not to care. It was a 10 hour flight and my TV wasn't working. I saw some empty seats and thought to ask if I could move, instead of just moving to another seat. I informed the flight attendant about the TV and he said that he'd try and turn it on, otherwise he'd check if there was a seat available. He came back almost an hour later, while serving the food and asked if it was working and saw for himself that it wasn't. He then promised to look for another seat and get back to me. The next time I saw him was when they were serving breakfast. I had even asked a colleague of his to follow up the issue for me, as well as asking for an extra blanket (he was very dismissive and seemed annoyed). I got the blanket but not the response. I resigned to just sleeping the whole way. I don't know why it was such an issue when the ticket was paid for and comes standard with those things. I wasn't asking for them to upgrade me. All I wanted was to have the option to watch something or listen to music in between naps, and they made it seem like they were doing me a favour. No feedback whatsoever.

"When my company informed me that I was to travel on SAA during the strike, I was not particularly impressed. I had images of delays and perhaps even an unplanned stay over in Johannesburg.
My flight time was moved from 7:30 to 6:00 and I was even less impressed.
I arrived at the airport, arrived at the boarding gate and was upgraded to Business Class. This immediately improved my mood. While in Business class the service was as expected, although I was amused by the suggestion from the steward of adding milk to my muesli (didn't work!).
We departed on time and I arrived at my destination with time to spare! Altogether a positive outcome from an organization that focused on delivering customer value even while under severe strain because of the strike.
My return flight was slightly delayed, but if I take into account that my colleague only arrived home at 1:00 in the morning, after flying on another airline, I am a satisfied customer.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/527johndaniels,527johndaniels wrote a review Nov 2019,527johndaniels,"Cape Town, South Africa",8 contributions,,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r728728790-South_African_Airways-World.html,Service Delivery despite the strike,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm very sorry to read about all the bad experiences here on TA, some of them sound awful.... all I can say is that my experience was great (I was lucky to be able to fly business on this flight). First time I've flown with SA Airlines - have flown Lufthansa to JNB before and this was definitely better!

Cabin configuration is very well-planned with 1-2-1 seating, so lots of privacy for solo travellers - and the seat width seemed a bit wider than in other similar airline configurations, which definitely made sleeping more comfortable!

The cabin crew were excellent from start to finish, warm, welcoming, friendly and hospitable.

As we later learned upon boarding, there were almost no other passengers in Business so almost any bid would have been enough.  Their little tool to decide how much to bid was definitely misleading and caused us to pay more than we needed to.       We settled in to our seats at the bulkhead for the first leg of the flight to Ghana and on takeoff we heard water falling somewhere in the galley in front of us.  Shortly after, the flight attendant asked my wife to lift up her feet and she placed a blanket under her footrest.  She thought she was being nice but soon learned that the blanket was wet when she put her foot down.  The attendant then put a plastic bag and another blanket under her but that didn’t work either and the carpet under both our feet was soaking wet.  The blankets we were using soon became wet and the forward cabin began to smell musty.  We had to endure this treatment for the entire 6+ hour flight to Ghana.       When we arrived in Ghana we sat on the tarmac for two hours waiting for refueling and the local maintenance crew tried to figure out where the water was coming from.  They mopped up the galley and asked us to switch seats a few rows back and that solved the wet carpet problem.  However, the smell in the cabin remained for the balance of the trip to Dulles.       When we asked the airline to refund our upgrade fee, they gave us a polite response that they would look into it and get back to us.  That was over two months ago and they have completely ignored all of my subsequent emails and calls.  Definitely won’t fly with SAA again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/919greggr,Gregg R wrote a review Nov 2019,Gregg R,"Marina del Rey, California",120 contributions,57 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r727635055-South_African_Airways-World.html,Don’t Pay for Business Class,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I paid for a business class seat but due to a plane change, I was bumped to economy at the gate.  I could live with that but the airline promised me 150% refund of the fare difference on that leg as compensation.  On return and now two months later with a written offer as proof, I've been refused twice and continue to fight.  On top of everything on my return flight I had to pay excess luggage on a bag the was returned to me days later with everything in it smashed and they paid about 10% of the claim with absolutely no explanation.  The flight was OK .. the after flight service is appalling.  Next time I fly with them I'll save the business class ticket and spend it on an extra night and good massage.  It would be a better investment and hopefully won't involve corporate lies and poor service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/27/00/05/5c/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louloudonlan,Loulou D wrote a review Nov 2019,Loulou D,"Brisbane, Australia",149 contributions,51 helpful votes,Brisbane - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r727476893-South_African_Airways-World.html,Business Class?

"Because I checked in early for my flight from Victoria Falls to Johannesburg, I got a great seat selection for both of my flights with South African Airways. The connecting flight was from Johannesburg to Heathrow and was scheduled at eleven and a half hours overnight. I was seated in the right aisle seat of the middle four seats of the aircraft at the bulkhead. Another gentleman was seated in the left aisle seat, and we shared the two vacant seats between us. Bonus plus. The flight, service and comfort of my flight were great. Upon boarding, they give you a small, pouch that contains earplugs, an eyeshade, stereo system earplugs, a pair of socks, and hand wipes. This was most beneficial to me since I had stupidly packed mine in my checked bag, and I hoped to get some zeds on board.

The negative of the flight was the late departure of almost an hour, for some undisclosed reason. No time was recovered on our very long flight. I have been on many flights that had a late departure, that regained most of that lost time during much shorter trips. Consequently, we were an hour late arriving at Heathrow. This wouldn’t be a big deal if I didn’t have another connecting flight.

That was to Toronto, and I only had two hours and five minutes between flights, which was now cut to one hour. Upon my panicked disembarkation, I was told that there were six other people in the same predicament. I was greatly relieved and appreciated that we were then escorted to airport security. Unfortunately, we found an enormous lineup in front of us. Another late arriving flight was in the queue in front us. They were also on my same connecting flight. They numbered about forty.

Heathrow security had two separate inspection stations, however only one was open, of course. Nightmare! There were only four other people behind me when I finally passed through security. Sadly I also needed a boarding pass for my ongoing flight, as the Johannesburg agent was not allowed to preprint it for me, for a now forgotten reason. Air Canada did that expeditiously and I scrambled aboard as the last passenger. Surprisingly, our baggage caught the flight too. Well done.

After takeoff and settling in, I was realized that I had lost my SDHC card during the airport security ritual of possession purging etc. I have since registered it for lost and found online, but have not been lucky. Most of my photos have not been lost since I back them up to my iPad daily. Some are gone forever. In future I will empty all my pockets into my backpack before I get to the security station, to ensure that I don’t leave it in their tray. A tough lesson to learn.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/44/a7/da/edward-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tedward2017,Edward B wrote a review Nov 2019,Edward B,"Windsor Essex Pelee Island, Canada",28 contributions,30 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r727365263-South_African_Airways-World.html,Good but not timely,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I do really like South African Airways. I find the seats comfortable, the food good, the attendants friendly and helpful, and the bathrooms maintained. Normally they get a five-star rating from me.

This flight, however, was a frustration and an inconvenience to me because after I waited in their very long check-in lines (seems typical of Cape Town), I discovered these last legs of my flight were cancelled! Why that should be when I had already flown three other segments in this same trip, I do not know, and they couldn't tell me. That meant they had given my seat away -- a seat that I had pre-paid months earlier just so our group would be together! So, okay, they got me back on the flight and gave me a bulkhead aisle seat, so the ground staff did their best to help me out, but it was shocking and frustrating.

"My wife's phone rang this morning three times in short succession.  My daughter had been vacationing in Africa, and was stranded in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.  South African Airways is on strike.  Alternatively we booked her from VFA to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian, and then to Dulles, IAD.  On further research I learned that South African Airways posted a 145 million ""pound"" loss in 2017, and then stopped posting their financials.  The airline is state-owned.  The nation of South Africa was just downgraded by Moody's to ""negative"".  Simply, they don't have sufficient tax revenues to support a failing airline in South Africa.  Efforts to curb spending by the airline, to save itself, included 900 layoffs.  A strike ensued, which will probably destroy the airline, and any hope of recovery.  Recommendation: if you're traveling to Africa, book only on international airlines, do not rely on airlines owned and operated by their host countries.  Even if the local airline is an ""affiliate"" of British Airways, or American Airlines, has the resources to get you out if needed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/john9192018,john9192018 wrote a review Nov 2019,john9192018,"Kenly, North Carolina",13 contributions,4 helpful votes,Harare - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r726825940-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Daughter stranded in Zimbabwe, en route to South America.",Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My husband and I are both tall, and we both suffer with back pain.  I also have a Chronic Pain Disease called Fibromyalgia.  Business class is the only way I can tolerate a flight longer than a few hours.  We do quite a lot of flying, to Europe, the UK, Scotland, the United States, and other places.  We have always flown Business Class.  Even locally to Cape Town.  I cramp up in a confined place very quickly.  SAA is the only airways to fly from Johannesburg direct to New York.

"Recently flew Perth to Johannesburg return. Check in at Perth with QANTAS, no problems.
At the airlines check-in the woman was rude, disinterested and unhelpful. There was minimal eye contact and no appropriate salutation and she tended to mumble to herself, expecting that I would know she was talking to me. She didn't want to plug in my Frequent Flyer Card, and when I enquired about the lounge usage, she said ""Check upstairs"". No mention of where the lounge is. Even up in the lounge the woman at reception was rude and disinterested. No, Hello, How are you? It wasn't until she clarified that yes, I could use the lounge, that she was somewhat more pleasant. Staff in the lounge were pleasant.
Customer service on the airplane was very poor. No smiles, basic niceties from the stewardess. She suggested I had changed my seat when she took my special meal to the wrong seat.
Surprised they didn't do water rounds throughout the flight. When exiting the flight, the air stewardess didn't farewell us. She just looked grumpy and made no eye contact.
Yes, it is a hard job working in customer service. But big contrast to Virgin Australia and QANTAS. Flight from Perth to Brisbane was with QANTAS. Excellent customer service. ""Enjoy your meal"".

"I travelled from Birmingaham uk and connected with SAA in Johanesburg - flight 8110 which was scheduled to leave at 1140 but ended up leaving about an hour late. There were 3 hostesses led by Kanyi(on badge).An explanation and apology were given which we all accepted and we eventually boarded.

My issue started after we were given snacks midway on the travel. After the snacks the hostess came collecting the trash.

She put out her hand for me to collect the trash and hand it to her... but i was slow to understand what she wanted me to do . She stood there not picking the trash and giving me a look which could have cuddled milk.

She then signalled to my fellow passenger to hand over her trash which the passenger did . The hostess then left my trash on the tray in front of me and left.

I was still oblivious about what she was doing and called her back telling her she had forgotten to clear my tray . This is when she rudely told me "" you need to hand it to me! I put it in your hand so you should put it in mine!"" This was delivered with such rudeness and arrogance.

I was suprised that i told her had she asked me properly I would have been happy to hand her the trash but because she was making an issue of it I reminded her it is her job to collect and not mine . She told me she was not going to collect it ...and didnt!! She left me with a tray of trash because i did not hand it to her and she expected passengers to assist her with her job!!

I was really put off by this bad customer care... the lack of respect, the arrogance and contempt. I still have to fly with them to connect again on my way back but will definately NOT be using this airline

"Recent travels to, around, and from southern Africa had me on SAA several times. The flight from JFK to Johannesburg was OK. FAs were pleasant and polite and tried there best to make things right when the IFE did not work at all. The plane was freezing, but a FA got them to turn up the thermostat to a comfortable level. Shorter hops in southern Africa were acceptable. The same CANNOT be said for the return flight from Cape Town to JFK, especially the long leg from Johannesburg to JFK. I have never seen such rude, unfriendly, aloof, hostile-looking flight attendants aboard any aircraft. There was nothing pleasant about any of the four in my section of Economy--no smiles nor any warmth--just cold indifference bordering on hostility. Where does SAA find these people, and why are they hired to work with the flying public? Shortly after takeoff, drinks were served as if the FA was angry, and the ""meal"" (mostly inedible) service was done just as angrily. After the meal was served, FAs disappeared and only reappeared to again perform another grudging meal service for breakfast (also mostly inedible) shortly before arrival. This was the full extent of the cabin crew's involvement for a nearly 16-hour flight. Another point, and I hasten to say that I don't believe in objectifying women in any way. But the cabin crew were all very overweight, and they could not walk down the aisle of the plane without their hips and thighs hitting passengers seated on the aisle, of which I was one. I wondered how agile they could be in case of an emergency. Not to put too fine a point on it, but IFE options were outdated, and the touch screens were unresponsive much of the time. SAA was my fastest option to get to southern Africa, and all my flights were on time. But based on my experience from JNB to JFK, I would not fly them again regardless.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/72/88/20/badbart-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Badbart_9,Badbart_9 wrote a review Nov 2019,Badbart_9,California,64 contributions,51 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r723577879-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Inconsistent airline--OK at times, but when bad, BAD",Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I did not get the coffee in the morning only after I asked and the reply was I have to serve now other passengers. So the service was very poor for the money we paid.

"There are a couple of things about South African Air that make it a MUST  for my husband and I when we fly to Africa.   1.   In economy seating there are only 2 seats on  the window (vs. three).   This makes long distance travel in coach so much more pleasant.   It is just the two of us - no inconvenience of a third person like them needing to get in or out, taking over the armrest, etc.    2.  When you purchase an economy ticket from South African Air direct (unless it is some really discounted ticket) you become eligible to ""bid"" to upgrade to Business.    My husband and I used this process on this most recent trip.  We purchased the economy tickets a year in advance and when we got the email saying we were eligible we looked into it and decided we would be ok in coach.   When it got within a few weeks of the trip and we realized we had over 30 hours of travel ahead of us we decided to give the bidding process a try.   There is a minimum bid and a maximum bid and everything in between.   It gives you an idea of the dollar amount needed to be a weak, good, strong or excellent bid.   You also only bid on the legs of flight you are interested in upgrading.  So for example we were only interested in the longest leg of flight from JFK to Joburg.  We did not mind flying coach on the shorter flight to Entebbe.   That worked out great and our ""strong"" bid was accepted.   This saved us money because of being about to single out certain legs of the flight to go business and leaving the other as coach.   A few days before our return flight we were exhausted after 3 weeks of safari and we decided we ""had"" to be upgraded for the longest leg of the flight home.  We put in the amount needed to be considered and ""excellent"" bid and again were upgraded.   The biggest positive about this - the upgrade option was far cheaper than if we had purchased round trip business class for the trip.   Only one small negative - you don't find out until 24 hours before your flight if your bid has been accepted.  Your credit card is not charged unless your bid is accepted.    I have no experience with how low you can bid and still be granted the upgrade.  I've read a few articles on looking to see how many seats in Business class have sold on the flight and determine if they are likely to sell them all at market value.   Oh one more tidbit, you can enter your bid as soon as you get the email that says you are eligible but you allowed to alter the bid 3 times before the flight.  So like in our case, we had bid less on the return trip initially but a few days before the trip home decided we really wanted to upgrade.  So we went in and increased the bid.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/20/ca/69/islandgirl-bg-fl.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandgirl_bg_fl,islandgirl_bg_fl wrote a review Oct 2019,islandgirl_bg_fl,"North Port, Florida",93 contributions,74 helpful votes,New York City - Entebbe,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r721015217-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Using the ""bid"" process to upgrade",Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I know SAA is awful, but I am forced to fly them as there are no other airlines that fly to Lusaka from South Africa. We waited for more than 90 minutes to board with no word from any airline staff as to why we were delayed, the flight itself was bumpy and I'm pretty certain the pilot was struggling to land as we kept tilting from side to side during our approach and landing.

"We recently visited South Africa on holiday and had two bad flights with SSA. This review is of our return flight from JNB to HKG.

During our original flight from HKG to JNB we sat in the plane, delayed for 3.5 hours as they struggled to compute fuel needs for the heavy cargo load they were attempting to carry. Eventually they had to offload the large cargo payload so that we could finally take off.

Sadly, on the flight back from JNB to HKG, we again sat in the plane on the tarmac, unable to take off due to reverse throttle and engine problems. Engineers worked on the plane for 4 hours while we sat with no entertainment, often without air conditioning. At that point they simply cancelled the flight, put us up in nearby hotel and flew us home the following day.

Our eventual outbound flight departed on time the next morning. We arrived at our rescheduled time in HKG fine as well. Flight was average, seat comfort what you can expect of the older fleet used by SAA. Entertainment system nearly in shambles, similar to our flight from HKG to JNB. Headphones didn't work, touch screen didn't work, remote connection to the system very slow. System crashed three times while watching movies.

In flight meals were ok, better than what we experienced on the flight from HKG to JNB. The curry chicken wasn't bad. Flight attendants were friendly and worked hard during the flight. Can not fault them for their efforts. Luggage made its way to the carousel in Hong Kong in a timely manner.

In the end, two bad flights with SAA on this trip to South Africa, making it really difficult to consider using them again in the future even if they do offer the most convenient flights and affordable seats for travel to southern African destinations from HK.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradJill,BradJill wrote a review Oct 2019,BradJill,"Hong Kong, China",151392 contributions,25150 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Hong Kong,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r720553827-South_African_Airways-World.html,Flight cancelled after we sat over 4 hours in the plane on the tarmac,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On the way to Accra I was fortunate to fly on the plane bound for Washington which had space and a proper in-flight entertainment system. On the way back I boarded a woefully overbooked A320-200 that would be passable for a 1-2 hour domestic flight on this 6 Hour international flight. Apart from the fighting over the scarce overhead lockers - the total absence of inflight entertainment and generally uncomfortable conditions on board there also seemed to be mass confusion as to who could claim which seat. This was truly cynical exploitation of a busy route using a plane unsuitable for this role. I would arguably been even more bitter had I coughed up for business class which was way way off the pace compared to any international carrier. If you fly JNB-ACC please check the plane on the service before booking.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/9d/0a/b1/jimboza.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimboza,Jimboza wrote a review Oct 2019,Jimboza,"Johannesburg, South Africa",150 contributions,127 helpful votes,Accra - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r720361268-South_African_Airways-World.html,Inappropriate plane for a long flight ,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We actually took 3 different flights on SAA. First was actually on their sister airline, Mango, Johannesburg to Richards Bay on one of the smallest planes I've flown on in years - carry on baggage had to go into a closet as there was no space under the seats or in overhead bins, but there was still a very nice flight attendant that served lunch and beverages for a 1 hour flight.  Next, we flew from Durban to Cape Town - much bigger airport, much bigger plane - still a pleasant experience.  Last was a flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg.  Still a very enjoyable short flight, ending in a short walk to the international terminal.Originally booked the flights by phone while still in Canada, speaking to an agent in Florida.  A very efficient and pleasant transaction.  Online check-in for each flight was easy, and since all three flights were within South Africa, security at each airport was relatively quick and easy.  The one negative would be, they do not make annoucements in the airports for boarding - you just kind of follow the crowd.  I don't know what SAA's international flights are like, but for travel within the country, I would recommend them.  Relatively inexpensive too!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/53/06/c2/dusty008.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dusty008,dusty008 wrote a review Oct 2019,dusty008,"Ontario, Canada",145 contributions,80 helpful votes,Durban - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r720014225-South_African_Airways-World.html,Very nicely run airline,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flying is stressful business and first impression plays a very big part.It is not all about arriving safely. Our flight,SA-354 on 16/09/19 was 40 minutes late departing Cape Town for Johannesburg and we where feeling stressed. But as soon as we boarded our flight everything changed for the best and it only got better. The welcoming, inter-action,mannerism and politeness of all the cabin staff wiped away all the stresses.The biggest thanks goes to the Captain for the best takeoff and landing ever and for his excellent communication and for keeping the transit passengers up-to-date on their connecting flight arrangements. When we left the plane we thanked all the crew and told the chief cabin officer to thank the captain on our behalf only to be told that we could thank him directly which we did. South African Airlines should be very proud of the Captain and all his staff of SA-354-16/9/19  and if this is a start of a promotional drive then this is the the crew to billboard the promotion.

"The flight to and from Johannesburg to Heathrow was OK. Last time we flew that route the plane was an aging Jumbo which was awful. These flights were a much newer Airbus 330 which was much better and the in flight entertainment actually worked.

Service throughout was less than average, bad mannered, surly and slow. What absolutely ruined things however was the food on the journey from Jo'berg to Heathrow. Absolutely inedible.

Our agent had booked the flights and we had to fly south from Windhoek to Jo'berg to wait seven hours to fly north again. Not their fault but next time we will go Namibian and take a flight home from Frankfurt.

"It all started quite favourably with a good check-in and published departure time met. However after only a short time the seats became very uncomfortable - very hard seat and head rests in the wrong position for me - this made it hard to rest your head back and caused neck pain.

We were served drinks but unbelievably they had run out of (or had under stocked) tonic water so our G&T's could only be served with 'bitter lemon' - not so good. Later a member of cabin crew made an announcement that a second bar service was imminent but they had run out of most drinks - it may have been easier to say what they did have in stock - never encountered this before on any airline.

The return flight was slightly better in terms of bar stock but as vegetarians who had ordered a 'special meal' we weren't offered wine with our meal. The meals were all very much below par on both flights with the outbound breakfast being inedible - I think it was a traditional South African dish called pap which resembled wallpaper paste with 3 what looked like dates on top - the whole dish was very salty and my wife was forced to eject the unknown object - terrible and not great at 6.00am after a restless night. The breakfast on return was equally 'odd' - spinach, a sturdy tomato puree (quite tasty) with three fried rings of aubergine served with fruit and a bread roll (no butter).

Not the best flight with the cabin crew being just average in terms of making you feel 'special' and looked after. There was no sale of alcohol / tobacco on board.

Ironically we had two domestic flights to/from Capetown on which the service, ambience, snack / drinks and comfort was far superior, it just seemed that the long haul trip was noticeably poor.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/09/84/5b/cartle.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cartle,Cartle wrote a review Oct 2019,Cartle,"Stourbridge, United Kingdom",302 contributions,190 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r719343036-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Uncomfortable, Poor Food and ran out of many drinks.",Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was seemingly no air conditioning or inadequate air conditioning from boarding until after seat belt signs were turned off during flight and then it took over an hour for air to be at comfort level. Even the flight crew were using paperwork to fan themselves cool.

"We recently flew direct with South African Airways from Hong Kong (HKG) to Johannesburg (JNB) for a visit to trip to South Africa.

Flight was booked online, payment processed and flight confirmation email received in a timely manner. Check-in and boarding at HKG were both fine. Unfortunately, prior to take-off, we had to sit on the tarmac for 3.5 hours while crew attempted to calculate fuel requirements, apparently, it seemed we were taking a very large cargo payload. After nearly 4 hours, they decided to unload a considerable amount of cargo so that the flight could depart.

After the long delay, luckily shorter than the 18 hour delay experienced on the return leg of our flight, we were finally in the air. Flight was uneventful. The entertainment system didn't work well, responding quite slowly to the remote control and not at all to the touch screen. In-flight meals were mediocre, neither finished. Cup noodles taken between scheduled meals was best thing served.

Leg space average, seats not as comfortable as what we usually experience with long-haul carriers, resulting in less restful flight. Toilets were in bad shape, being quite dirty and unpleasant on both occasions that we attempted to use them. Upon arrival, luggage arrived on the carrousel in a timely fashion and we were on our way out of O.R. Tambo airport.

In the end, didn't find this to be a good flight in pretty much regard. Sadly, our return flight from JNB to HKG 10 days later was perhaps even worse with a massive 18 hour delay but more on that experience with the next review.

"This was the first time that I travelled with this airline. Seat seemed unusually narrow compared to other airlines with very little leg room. Tray table was dirty with food stains as was the area under the window.

The actual logistics of the service of food and drink was very odd. Firstly, the drinks trolley came around and we were asked what we wanted to drink. I chose a juice thinking naturally that water would come with the meal. About 15 mins later, the food tray arrived - no water. Food was far from anything I have had on airlines like SIA, QANTAS, Qatar or Emirates. Most of it was left uneaten. The same occurred with the next meal, breakfast.

Given that this was an 11hour 15min flight, the air hostesses were very tardy in coming around with any drinks at all throughout the flight. Food was doled out quickly and, it seemed, without much care and attention and not much was seen of them again.

Their domestic service, Airlink is far superior. I went on various Airlink flights ranging from 40 mins to 1 hr 25mins and had far superior food and service. Such a pity. Even their uniforms looked better!

"This was my first trip to South Africa.
The choices are limited if you want a ""direct"" flight. SAA I think was a good choice.
The flight is long, no matter who takes you there, so the difference is the service.
The seats where ok, hard to sleep on them, even when fully recline(bed mode).
The service was very good. The staff was very friendly and available all the time.
They should plan a better menu, choices were limited and 100% of the time they ""ran out"" of the best choices on the menu. I know I did not book a flight to eat but it will be nice to have some choices.
The other problem was the ""entertainment""
TV are old and the image is very poor. They need to either repair the TV's ore replace thermal together.

After 7 days back at home they say they will only compensate with USD 75 daily for 5 days but we have to send them the recieps.

"This is now the second time the crew arrives late. All the passengers arrived on time (2-3 hours before departure, but the crew arrives late (again!!!!!!!!). Giving some feeble excuse about traffic (cry us a river, plan better you @##$$%). This is now becoming borderline criminal to be allowed to happen. The crew were even sporting snacks that they had time to acquire while we waited at JFK, including a father with a tiny infant, nice one SAA (good job!)

If that wasn't bad enough, we get on board and only half the infotainment screens work. Once again, not the first time, the best was listening how the crew lie to the passengers, urging them to press buttons and promising to RESET the system to get it going again, knowing all well that it wasn't going to work.

Come meal time, you were lucky to get your first choice, left alone if they remembered the butter.

I'm gob smacked at the level of their efficiency, why not strip the screens, can the meals and paint the plain in cammo colours, because this is something out of the jungle.

The questions remains, if this is the level of their planning, the extent of their concerns for our comfort, how well are the engine maintained???

"It was a nice flight. It wasn't a long flight.
However when I booked it I personally took too long and so ended up in business class because that was the only thing available.

When arriving at the airport in LVI I thought I was glad I made that mistake as the queue to check in was incredibly long. The business class check in only had 2 ladies in front of me and my friend. However the wait was definitely too long. There were 2 staff members checking people in - well really, only one. The other was doing something else more along the lines of ignoring everyone.
A woman was standing near the queue and asking everyone that got in line with us if they were indeed in biz class and we showed her our emails/online boarding info.

Eventually the lone man helping customers for our area finished and we were ushered up past the two women in front of us in the queue. Apparently they did not have biz class seats but were refusing the get out of the line.

Our check in process was quick and so then we progressed to the next security check and into the airport proper. It was a very simple check in but no special greeting as usually happens with upgraded class seats. No special welcome or lounge information was provided.

The boarding process was somewhat chaotic. If you were boarding first then you had to push past everyone else trying to board but while they were denied boarding because it wasn't their turn yet, they would block access to the service agents trying to find biz class boarders. Basically, you have to learn to be a little bit pushy.

The staff on the flight was very friendly. Nothing that stood out in particular but it was still a nice flight. A short one too. The food that was served didn't look too grand but it didn't taste bad at all.

I would fly South African again if I had the opportunity.

"I chose this flight because it was non-stop to JoBurg, so that was an advantage.  However, the ticketing, boarding process and in flight service is in dire need of examination.  I especially found the upgrade process to business class a bit ridiculous. You are forced to buy an economy seat and bid on the update; you don’t find out if you “won” the bid until boarding.  CRAZY.  On top of that, in advance you are told that you have an excellent chance of upgrade based on your bid amount and then end up not getting it?   The system makes no sense.  Passengers should be allowed to book business class up front without the bidding nonsense.  Also, the entertainment system on the plane was spotty at best.

"I had three flights in all with South African Airways in business class. The planes are older with 2x2x2 seating, I prefer the seating which has individual seats at the side for solo passengers. Having said that the seats were comfortable and lay flat and were quite wide too. They put a cover on them and also gave out quilts when it was time to sleep,and a decent pillow. The service vsried a bit but was generally good but the menus were limited and food not up,to business class standard. I sat next to a man who was South African and he said he would say business class on that airline was equal to Premium Economy on other airlines.

"I am careful to book my trips into the southern cone of Africa exclusively on SAA. To begin with, I just like their fleet of Airbus planes offer a superior flying experience.. The seats are more comfortable than the direct competition and SAA allows for enough space between rows in coach to sidestep the inhuman, sardine effect on competing carriers - you know exactly what I mean.  Next, in my experience SAA flight attendants have always been friendly and customer oriented - no scowls or frowns or attitude. Oftentimes they have expressed a uniquely South African sense of humor which is refreshing. Beverage service on my international flight included wine, beer, and spirits at no extra cost in economy.

We flew business class to SA so we could travel in comfort. The plane was old and the seats were uncomfortable- even though we coul lie right out.

"Like on the outbound journey was the catering again a lunch box with the same range of items. For a four hour flight simply not acceptable, more so as no added purchase option was available.
The E190 on a 4 hour flight is borderline really, given the 2x2 seating, especially when a flight is full.

"The flight was operated on behalf of SAA by SA Express using an Embraer E190.
The typical 2x2 configuration in economy class makes for narrow seats and with the flight nearly full was I in for 4 long hours.
Having flown repeatedly with Ethiopian over the past couple of weeks, where in economy class on the 1 hr 45 min flight to Addis a full meal is served, I was in for a shock when a meagre lunch box was handed out, containing ONE sandwich, a piece of cheese, a bisquit, a small chocolate, some dried fruits and a small piece of pastry.
WHAT? On a four hour flight? This is cutting cost at the wrong end of the stick and for my part I will not fly with them again.
The crew, especially Maxine, was very friendly, their drink service efficient - unlike my last flight with them when I had to hustle for tea - and swift to arrange a refill.
What should be announced on these flights into Johannesburg is an explanation of the procedure for passengers flying on a domestic service to their final destination.
I knew the drill, which is to collect the bags - though labelled through - go through customs and then hand them in again at SAA or in my case Mango. I had to literally run to make my flight, others I understood on arrival were not so lucky.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Sep 2019,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Entebbe - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r709300206-South_African_Airways-World.html,Friendly crew BUT the catering on a 4 hour flight defies logic!,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Oh where to start?! I have flown SAA quit a few times about 15 years ago. It was just a pleasure.
But now, unfortunately, everything has gone down the drain.
1. Online booking and check-in are average. Not great, but it works.

2. The customer service employees are plain arrogant. Do not expect any motivation from them to assist you. If they decide to assist you, one again: do not expect any competence.
Also, CS only available during office hours. Do not try to call them after 20:00

3. The flight was a disaster.
- the entertainment was broken for aprox. 20 passengers
- the food really does not taste good. That is if you were lucky enough to the get the meal of your choice.
- flight assistants once again unfriendly.
- quite a few flight assistants are so obese, that they don't fit in the aisle.

"Our flight to Accra, Ghana, from Dulles in DC was horrendous initially.  The window shades were left up and the air was turned off, so while everyone loaded the plane for a total of probably an hour, we were extraordinarily hot.

I've been on countless flights, though all seasons (from New Orleans, living near Houston Tx) and I've never experienced this before.  The plane was also quite old, business class seats were not well padded.

"My husband and I took our first flight to South Africa with some trepidation. It's a really long flight.
We paid for extra leg room which I recommend. We both could fully extend our legs. Although, I was sitting between people, I could get up and move around without bothering anyone.
Each passenger is given a blanket that's clean and sealed in plastic and a pillow.
Very helpful in such a long flight.
We were served dinner early in the flight. The meals are pretty good. Alcoholic beverages are free.
Sadly, we did not bother to buy extra leg room. What a mistake. 15 + hours is a long time to be squished into a small space without room to extend your legs.

"Had three in-country flights booked with SAA. All three were either cancelled, times changed and/or delayed. Some changes were not compatible with our international flight out of Africa. One meant three hour earlier flight and longer layover, Talking with SAA representatives was an exercise in futility - long hold times, then told we would incur “change fees” if we moved to a different flight. All of this was on our international cell phone calling plan, so who knows how much that will cost?!? We were forced to rebook one flight with another airline and are hoping to get a refund from SAA, but per their email response, they have “high volumes,” so who knows?
Friends in South Africa say the problem is this airline is run by the government so is tainted by corruption and inefficiency and advised us to never book with SAA again.

"Booked my elderly mother on a flight from Harare with assisted travel.  A catalogue of problems from the moment of check in.

The SAA website does not allow you to log miles to another Star Alliance Airline if you have an SAA Voyager number.

"Unfortunately, I use this airline often due to limited choice from Perth. Well, only direct service from Perth is with South African Airways.It will take too much of my time to write all the negatives (only positive is that it's direct), but the biggest ones would have to be the absolute price rip off! In comparison to other airlines taking travel time and Johannesburg airport in consideration (for some would argue landing costs at Joburg push prices up), it's criminally high prices. Consistently around $2000 pp return from Perth to Jhb for 11h flight. Some flights are double the flying time (Perth London or San Fransisco), but at half the price. No calculator needed to work out the crime there. Maybe, if it could be justified by exceptional airline like Qatar, Emirates so on, it wouldn't leave such a sour taste in the mouth. But, there's NOTHING exciting about this airline. I haven't been on one where a great section of inflight TV's are out of order or they try to reset it multiple times. The aircraft usually has very hot and very cold spots. The staff are very loud for an overnight flight, almost like they are outside in the bush somewhere. It's corrupt, we all know that.

"Had an epic awful trip when our flight to Joburg from Dulles made what was supposed to be a 45min refueling stop in Accra but then had mechanical issues. It happens, I don’t blame the airline, overall was handled tolerably as far as keeping us comfortable and informed while on the plane for 6hrs of attempted repairs. Kudos to the captain and cabin staff. Then had to offload to Accra airport and chaos ensued. Miscommunication, confusion, telling passengers different things. Finally got sorted out with tickets that night and arrived the next day, but somehow the system messed up  our return flight tickets. Showed up at the airport a week later to fly home and couldn’t be ticketed, were treated like this was our fault and not their problem, but finally were allowed to board just before doors closed after a lot of frustration. Then we had to get out of our seats in Dakar in the middle of the night to give a boarding couple our seats and initially were told we couldn’t be seated together for the final leg. Had such a great time in South Africa I couldn’t wait to tell all my friends to go, but not on this airline in spite of what looked like a relatively direct itinerary.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraveL1ght,TraveL1ght wrote a review Aug 2019,TraveL1ght,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",51 contributions,29 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r703729706-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Disorganized ticketing and ground staff, cabin staff fine ",Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"South African Airlines or (SA) has the most ridiculous and most insensitive name correction policy ever. I booked a flight and had one (1) letter in my last name wrong, all the other details were correct and they refused to correct it, even within 24 hours if booking. I was informed, rudely, by various South African airways agents, supervisors and booking people that the only way to achieve this correction was to pay for a whole new more expensive ticket. Then wait up to 2 months for my refund, yes 2 months! And pay a change fee on top of all that.

They were not sensitive to the cost of the flight or my financial burden. They did not treat me with respect or even like a human being and did not care at all about anything other than taking more money from me. I will not recommend this airline unless they care enough to actually do something positive and change this ridiculous policy or least better alternative for clients. I highly doubt that based on my experience. Buyers beware! South African airlines believes human beings never make errors in spelling. This is sick joke from a supposedly major airline. It is shameful and extremely disappointing.

"Flying domestically at an extreme cost, with rude ground staff and just unprofessional work.
For being South Africa's main carrier, I highly do NOT recommend tourists to use SAA, even for international flights. A flight for economy can cost as much as €300 for one way in domestic, and that can even be operating Mango.

"There are 2 interesting parts of this flight: first the landing in Wallis Bay, Namibia to refuel about half way through the journey. You don't leave the plane but can observe the Kalahari Desert and the fairly bleak setting of Wallis Bay nonetheless. You set off again after about 20-30 minutes for St Helena. As a remote island, after a long time of flying over an ocean, a brown speck hoves in to view and the plane approaches in an arc, flying in past the rather alarmingly sharp looking King and Queen Rock to land on the short runway in front of the impressive glass-fronted terminal. St Helena Airport is notoriously prone to inclement weather: strong crosswinds and, worse, fog. This can lead to the delay or even cancellation of the weekly flight to or from Johannesburg - though I was fortunate and the landing was smooth and my return flight not affected. There is no in flight entertainment so make sure you have a book!

I have recently done four flights with SAA and 3 were good but one was awful.  It is difficult to judge an airline on one flight.  The type of aircraft is so important.

"Initially,based on all the negative reviews I've seen before,  I was quite skeptical using SAA flying to NY.  Im a frequent  flyer, use to flying with he best like Qatar and Etihad, Lufthansa and BA. I must say I was rather blown away by SAA's service! Last here I flew to China with Qatar and I was NOT impressed! My experience  with SAA was just amazing. Awesome Service, Awesome food and plenty of it!!!!  Yes the entertainment system needs a revamp but its really not that bad. The seats are a bit hard but in comparison with the others its nothing to complain about. If you fly for 16 hours you will be a bit stiff, not much the seats could do about it.

"I went with an open mind, as I have not flown South African Airways in a very long time. I flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg which was fine although I was told that I could not check my luggage through to Washington DC because I had a longer layover than 5 hours in Johannesburg. After re-checkin of my luggage in Johannesburg (which was apparently unnecessary as the Johannesburg agent said it could have been checked all the way through from Cape Town), I went to the SAA lounge. I was quite surprised at the drop in quality, as I recalled the lounge being very nice the last time I was there. The lounge was okay but paled in comparison to other airline lounges. Generally,I did not find the lounge check-in staff very helpful or knowledgeable. In fact, one person was extremely unprofessional especially when I asked about my flight which was delayed because of technical difficulties (the pilot announced a plane change). Although,I was relieved to be on an operational plane as the week before a plane on the same route had an emergency landing on the same route. Of course, I missed my connection travelling on to Canada, and then the rebooked later flight was delayed because of a missing pilot!

I flew one way business class with British Airways and Qatar airways to South Africa and the flight experiences were far superior! I do not recommend South African Airways at all!

Now for the good ..... The cabin crew were excellent, the food was good and the wine list amazing.

"I went with an open mind, as I have not flown South African Airways in a very long time. I flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg which was fine although I was told that I could not check my luggage through to Washington DC because I had a longer layover than 5 hours in Johannesburg. After re-checkin of my luggage in Johannesburg (which was apparently unnecessary as the Johannesburg agent said it could have been checked all the way through from Cape Town), I went to the SAA lounge. I was quite surprised at the drop in quality, as I recalled the lounge being very nice the last time I was there. The lounge was okay but paled in comparison to other airline lounges. Generally,I did not find the lounge check-in staff very helpful or knowledgeable. In fact, one person was extremely unprofessional especially when I asked about my flight which was delayed because of technical difficulties (the pilot announced a plane change). Although,I was relieved to be on an operational plane as the week before a plane on the same route had an emergency landing on the same route. Of course, I missed my connection travelling on to Canada, and then the rebooked later flight was delayed because of a missing pilot!

I flew one way business class with British Airways and Qatar airways to South Africa and the flight experiences were far superior!

"My first time flying SAA Airllink.  Overall the seat and service were fine.  In fact, the food and beverage service is superior to US airlines.  My rating is for the confusing baggage rules on SAA Airlink.  The rules are different between mainline SAA and SAA Airlink.  Before departing the US, I read the rules on the Airlink website and thought I understood the rules.  I am an experienced traveler and have two advanced degrees, so I'd like to think I can read and  comprehend English.  Airlink has a weight concept and piece concept.  I thought the passenger could choose the concept that best served them.  My understanding was that I could check 1 20 kg luggage for free and pay $30 USD for a second 20 kg luggage.  This was spelled out in the section on piece concept.  However, I found out at check in that my flight used the weight concept, not the piece concept.  Therefore, my second 20 kg luggage would be charged $10 per kg x 20 kg.  Additionally the carry on suitcases had a limit of 8 kg.  Anything over 8 kg was charged $10 / kg.  Overall my family and I were faced with over $400 in excess baggage fees.  After 45 minutes talking to the SAA manager at the airport, he did me a favor and only charged me only $200.Please understand the baggage and weight limits before you depart the US or you may be in for an unpleasant surprise.  The SAA and SAA Airlink websites are very confusing.  I can't recommend this airline.  Fly British Airways / Comair if possible.  They allow 2 23 kg luggage.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0d/3d/03/f1/michael-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcN9849AW,Michael C wrote a review Aug 2019,Michael C,"Los Angeles, California",50 contributions,43 helpful votes,Livingstone - Nelspruit,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r697983799-South_African_Airways-World.html,Beware of confusing baggage rules,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

As I heard from other frequent travellers, it really depends on the crew, some of them are excellent but some are very unfriendly and seem to be unhappy with their work. Even flying in business class doesn't mean you'll have a great service, the most helpful crew I've seen aboard South African was at coach class (excellent crew, by the way).

"I am very disappointed with the overall quality and service of the SAA business class flights from OR Tambo to JFK:

1. QUALITY

- The entertainment system glitched throughout the entire flight to JFK. This was not the worst part; it seems the system is somehow linked to the seat recline function, so the passengers' seat function controls didn't work several times throughout the 17-hour flight (for up to 15-20 minutes per glitch period). Some people were stuck in a reclined position while others were stuck upright when it was time to sleep.

- On the returning flight, the TV screens were hardly responsive to touch and were very frustrating to use.

- The seats are hard and uncomfortable. Worse still, if a passenger is seated next to a window, they can't step around or over their seatmate when the latter is in a reclined position. This means they have to wake up their seatmate to go to the bathroom, etc. On Ethiopian Airlines, the seats are soft and wide, and there is more space around and between seats.

- The seat spaces are fairly cramped. For both SAA flights, I had to store my handbag in the overhead compartment for takeoff and landing. On Ethiopian Airlines, there are more surrounding compartments and features (personal coat hanger, etc.) to store a passenger's personal items, as well as more seat features and functions.

- The seat recline function is rickety and makes a lot of noise when in use. Even with customized earplugs, I would wake up whenever my seatmate used her seat recline function. On other airlines, this function is smooth and effortless.

2. FOOD

- On the flight to JFK, they ran out of eggs for breakfast, and it seemed that at least half of the passengers complained about not getting eggs. This has never happened to me before on any other flights, including economy class ones.

- On the returning flight for lunch, they ran out of salmon. (This didn't affect me personally, but did affect my seatmate.)

- On the departing flight, the flight attendant took away my untouched serving of butter and then, when I asked for butter later, said that each passenger is allocated only 1 serving of butter. This is utterly absurd.

- Apart from the desserts, the food is not that much better than what's served in economy class.

3. FLIGHT ATTENDANTS

- For most of the departing flight, there was only one overworked flight attendant serving our section, which meant that the service was very slow. The passenger who I sat next to was equally appalled by the service and noted that after the meal service, the rest of the flight attendants changed into their pyjamas and disappeared for most of the flight. Also, the flights attendants were not always prompt and sometimes forgot to offer hot towels, blankets, etc.

- The same thing happened on my returning flight (though not to the same effect, and I must say that my returning flight was much better in terms of service, quality, food, etc.).

4. LOUNGES

- The lounge in OR Tambo is okay but a little chaotic, and the food looked unappetizing. I spent less than 10 minutes there even though I had over an hour to spare until boarding time.

- The SWISS lounge for SAA business class flyers in JFK is awful. The food was okay, but the atmosphere was cold and, even worse, the staff were rude and distant. I left that lounge very quickly and returned to the main waiting area of the airport.

---

Above are specific complaints, but in general, the business class experience was certainly not worth the price of the tickets.

This information is to inform future travelers with SAA that this is a very real situation that you may experience. Most travellers suffered financial loss due to the over booked flight as there were contractors who had to meet deadlines, missed connection flights and a number of travellers missed working days.

"We flew Economy Class on South African Airway’s Air Link between Hoedspruit and Johannesburg on an Embraer 190, a prop-jet. This late-morning 1-hour flight proved to be a repeat in reverse of the excellent flight we took from Johannesburg two days earlier. Then, we looked forward to going on safari in Kruger National Park. Now, we looked back on sighting the Big 5 and much, much more.

The small plane was clean and appeared to be well maintained. Our seats in the 2x2 configuration felt a bit cramped but were quite tolerable for the short flight. Immediately after takeoff, delightful flight attendants came down the aisle with the beverage service and an offer of a maple Danish or a cheese cross bun. Based on my earlier experience, I went for the Danish and was not disappointed.

Air currents caused occasional bumps, but I never felt uncomfortable. Boarding went smoothly and the arrival process of taking a bus to the gate was orderly with other passengers assisting my husband, who had mobility issues. We left and arrived on time.

The first time, we were re-routed (originally Maun to Cape Town directly, now went through Johannesburg). We were upgraded, and an SAA employee met us in Joberg to shuttle us quickly through customs and out to our onward flight, because we never would have made it otherwise. So as re-routings go, it wasn’t awful. But 5 days later our flight back to Joberg was also canceled. They rebooked us onto a flight operated by Mango (a budget airline). I’m sure that flight cost less, though I won’t see the difference. But we got where we wanted to be at the right time, so again- it worked out fine.

"On July 3, we boarded a brand new leased plane. We thought the flight would be wonderful but it was average. Why?
1.) It took approximately 50 minutes to receive our headphones. This makes no sense since folks from SA already had their headsets onboard!!!!!!!! We are squeezy flyers and should have had our headsets as soon as we stepped on board. I actually had to ask for them.
2.) we did not receive a complementary bag full of ear plugs, socks, tooth brush and toothpaste. Very strange considering we always got that on previous flights.
3.) the customer service on board was not enthusiastic but rather dull. Lifeless. Slow. We used the light to call the stewardesses but they never came. We always had to flag them down when they were walking back and forth.
———-
Although this was a brand new airplane that was clean and had roomier bathrooms; although the flight left on time; although the pilot flew the best flight I have ever been in based on great weather and smooth landing, the customer service made the experience AVERAGE at best for me.

SAA actually has the shortest travel time between Washington DC and Capetown. It does stop for 1 hour to refuel in either Ghana or another place but we don’t get off. Some passengers do disembark and others embark and passports are checked.

"Everyone knows about SAA’s financial crisis from the media and although being skeptical when I purchased my ticket, I was pleased and humbled to see that this crisis was not affecting the service on board my flight.

Service on board was exceptional and every request was attended to with positivity and vibrancy and unlike the snobbish service on some other airline that I have using lately.

"We flew Business Class in an Embraer 190 on SAA’s Air Link between Johannesburg and Antananarivo. This gave us access to the Business Class Lounge before boarding, which was much more comfortable than waiting at the gate. The boarding process, which involved taking a bus to the plane on the tarmac and ascending the stairs, went smoothly. I would estimate that about 90 percent of the passengers on the full flight were heading to Madagascar’s wilderness, based on gear and hiking boots.

Our clean, well-maintained section of the plane had six seats in a 2 x 1 configuration with ample space in the overhead bins. I found the seats to be comfortable with good legroom. The flight attendant was pleasant and attentive. She served an amazingly good lunch. It consisted of delicious-and-tender cold marinated beef, pasta, salad, herb crackers and cheese, topped off with vanilla pudding and chocolates.

We departed on time and arrived early.

Though the plane proved to be small, we found the 2 x 2 configuration to be quite comfortable for the relatively short 1-hour flight, which was totally full. The cabin was clean and well maintained. Smiling, pleasant flight attendants offered us a choice of a maple Danish or cross bun with cheese during the beverage service. I chose the Danish and considered it to be quite good.

"OK, I get it. I understand that measures need to be taken to prevent diseases from being transmitted from some countries to others. But I question whether it is necessary to spray the cabins with the passengers sitting in their seats. This happened before takeoff on our flight between Antananarivo and Johannesburg on an Embraer 170.

A flight attendant announced that this was about to happen and that the spray was totally harmless. But I knew it would aggravate my chemical sensitivities, based on my reaction to this procedure in the past, and immediately covered my face with a jacket. This helped a bit, but my skin tingled for at least an hour into the 3-hour flight. If I had known about this spraying well in advance, I would have boarded with a mask to wear.

We flew Business Class and were the only passengers in the six-seat cabin. The flight attendant essentially ignored us, except to serve lunch. We opted for ostrich, which proved to be tender and delicious. The side salads were also tasty.

Spoiled somewhat by Emirates I tried SAA because they offer the non-stop to Munich. The cabin crew is very helpful and professional ranks top. The meals offered surely can match that one of Emirates in quality though the variety offered there is unbelievable. Also breakfast in the morning and the choice they offer is excellent. My third point: legroom - it's very good (not only sufficient) even for a taller person like me. In summary: I like flying SAA now because I am not just a number but personally attended and the quality of service is tops and I was using SAA already several times.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dietmar035,dietmar035 wrote a review Jul 2019,dietmar035,"Pretoria, South Africa",3 contributions,,Johannesburg - Munich,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r688349143-South_African_Airways-World.html,"good service, meals and leg room",Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I left Cape Town for Jhb then Jhb to Munich on SAA. Sadly I was seated amongst a group of MBA Adult Students who were sponsored to see the worlds top companies in Germany. They were continuously shouting at each other from where they were seated. The gentleman next to me had finished 6 double G&T's and a beer after getting on the plane completely intoxicated. This was in the first two hours of take off to Germany. As I was seated at the Isle he would wake me up until three in the morning to get out of my seat do that he can fetch more liquor. I can't understand how the flight attendants allowed him to consume so much alcohol when they could see he had already far too much to drink. When at 3pm he finally passed out it was over me. The more I pushed him on to his seat the more he spread out over mine and the passenger next to him. I was thankful when morning arrived with breakfast. There was only one option for breakfast with pork in it. I could have opted for Kosher breakfast at booking but I have always never needed to in all my years of flying as two meals are always available on a flight. The plane that we flew on had technical problems with the onboard entertainment system.  It was also an old plane that needed some attention. The plane still had some papers in the seat pouch infront of me. It was not properly cleaned. I tried to book my seat 24 hours prior and after but the system did not allow me to do so. Not a great flight experience at all.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/21/6b/cf/26/karin-i.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karini244,Karin I wrote a review Jul 2019,Karin I,"Cape Town, South Africa",49 contributions,8 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Dubrovnik,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r688329326-South_African_Airways-World.html,My flight on SAA/Lufthansa,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The overall service on board was professional, staff was helpful and friendly.
The flight was clean overall except the lavatories could receive more attention during the flight as it was not very clean.
Meals were also better on the flight and meal options were enjoyable for in-flight meals.
Where I can also suggest a bit of improvement, we were nearly an hour late and were not advised prior to departure that we will be arriving at out destination later then scheduled, a lot of airlines will make up the lost time or at least advise of late arrivals.

"I phoned the Mango/SAA call centre prior to flying to find out baggage weight and fees. They were helpful, informative, friendly and attentive.

I received outstanding service at the Mango kiosk at King Shaka airport. I was served by a youngish, quiet gentleman in either the second or third counter.

I arrived in time for my flight and was checked in for both my Durban and Johannesburg flight by this pleasant young man. He asked my seat preference and if I would like to send my luggage ahead. He did let me know the flight was delayed and assured me I would make my connecting flight. After checking in, I went to the waiting area.

I think the flight was then further delayed because after an hour, the gentleman came and collected me! He put me on the next flight to Johannesburg and resent my luggage ahead.

I had delightful walk without luggage through OR Tambo and a stress-free 17 hour flight.

The American SAA staff at JFK New York were not half as efficient or helpful.

The cabin crew on both flights were South African and absolutely charming and caring.

The food provided on the Mango and SAA departing flights were much better than the food on my return flight from New York.

"Traveled Business Class for 1st time. Traveled with elderly parents, one who needed a wheelchair to cover distance from check-in to the door of the plane. We arrived early and went to the VIA lounge. The attendant took us, left us and came back at the right time for boarding. On board, the crew were professional and very helpful. Food was great, both meat and vegetarian roti options extremely tasty, and for a short flight, was impressive. Drinks were plentiful and were available on request. Crew were very friendly and helpful. The seats were comfortable. On a A319, choose the seats on the left if you are in solo or two people. The seats are in a 2-3 configuration. Bulkhead seats are not problematic as SeatGuru suggests. Maybe proximity to the galley may deter some, but the legroom is just as good as other rows. On arrival, we expected to wait until the other passengers left, but the wheelchair was waiting and we were ushered off with the other Business Class passengers, so no waiting.

"This flight is operated with a new Airbus A330-300. The interior of the business class cabin has been reconfigured and looks great. However the layout has several disadvantages compared to the previous layout. It is a 1-2-1 configuration, so those flying as a couple have to be in the middle. But even then it is practically impossible to talk to and look at your partner. The bed is very narrow, and seats 3D, 5D, 7D, with the seat between two ""blocks"", is VERY difficult to get off when the bed is flat out.

"We thought we would treat ourselves with a paid upgrade JNB-MRU on SAA, what a bad decision!
We were late taking off. I accept there are some things beyond the airlines control, okay. But it appears this was an omen for the rest of the flight.
1. I reported to the flight attendant, I had trouble plugging in the power adaptor. A flight attendant had a cursory look and said it was the wrong adaptor plug I brought (she knows better than her own inflight magazine). I tried a bit longer and eventually got it too work (difficult angle).
2. The headphones wouldn’t plug in. It was only after getting on my hands and knees, I was able to see the socket was out of alignment with the casing and eventually the plug was seated.
3. The TV wouldn’t work despite an in flight reboot from the crew.
4. I missed out my choice for main course, I was handed a brochure stating from time to time this happens, despite only sitting four rows from the front.
5. No wine was served with the meal.
6. The second meal selected, was the most awful chicken I have attempted to eat. I took a few bites, it was truly awful (dry).
7. It was served with unseasoned/unsalted boiled rice.
8. Despite the use of a linen, the meal was served on an airline tray with a paper doily.
9. Asked the male steward what was the name of the island we were flying over (remember I had no flight tracking screen). He replied he didn’t know, well here is tip, make a quick call to the flight deck and find out for your customer.

"We were on one of their new planes from Heathrow to Johannesburg where we changed planes to fly on to Cape Town. Much was made of their new seats. Goodness, they were uncomfortable. There was virtually no padding presumably to save weight. Ever the armrests were so hard that you couldn't stand them for long. I got literally no sleep. Funnily enough, I did manage to sleep on the short flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town on an old plane.
Just a word of warning, but this was my fault not theirs, and a schoolboy error; because Johannesburg is the port of entry into South Africa you have to go through both immigration and customs, claiming your bags on the way, and re-checking them in before boarding your next flight. We made it to the gate with about five minutes to spare but it caused me some anxiety and luckily no big aircraft had landed just before us.
Otherwise a fairly unexceptional flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/b7/a8/a4/mikegosterleymiddx.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeGOsterleyMiddx,MikeGOsterleyMiddx wrote a review Jun 2019,MikeGOsterleyMiddx,"Hounslow, United Kingdom",238 contributions,69 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r683591281-South_African_Airways-World.html,Uncomfortable,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown this route 5 times in economy class. The past 2 trips I upgraded to business class using their online auction tool. I placed a relatively low bid on an upgrade and won.

While I initially thought the price was steep, it is well worth it. For all four legs, I exited the plane feeling rested, relaxed, well fed and ready to enjoy my trip. I never thought I would say that about a 15 hour flight.

The seats were quite comfortable and fully adjustable. The food was top shelf-something I never thought I would say about airline food. The staff were the most competent and professional staff I have ever experienced on a plane.

The lounge at Tambo airport is spectacular. It has a bar, hot and cold buffet, breakfast bar, quiet room, entertainment room, conference room and showers. It made the five hour layover quite pleasant.

"This is a very convenient and quick flight from Jhb to Pmb (1 hour). While it is a bit expensive, it is worth flying directly to Pmb rather than to Durban, and then having to drive along the N3 and dealing with maniacal drivers. The aerodrome (Oribi) in Pmb is a delight and hasn't changed much in the last 30 years. It's small...and one doesn't have to wait ages for one's luggage to be offloaded.

The flight to Gan was the worst that I have experienced. Three of the stewardess were the worst excuse of service providers ever. On board was a family (husband wife an infant and a baby approx. 8 months old) who had a hard time keeping baby quite. The father tried to make his family as comfortable as possible without any help from the stewardess. Just when we thought he had finally succeeded in walks a demon from hell and derides this young man.(early thirties) publically so that even the dead were wakened by the manner in which this woman shouted at this passenger for attempting to make his family comfortable. This happened on 2occassions with 2 different stewardess.  Instead to shouting at this passenger they should have assisted him with his screaming kid. On our return flight was a worse nightmare. We had to sit on the runway for 2 hours waiting for a passenger who was too sick/drunk causing at least 50 other passengers to miss their connecting flights from Johannesburg to Durban and Cape Town. Not one of the crew attempted to assist these passengers who were then stranded in Johannesburg as they missed the last flights  to Durban had left for the night. This had to be the worst treatment that I've ever witnessed by an airline who had no regard for  their passengers at all.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trudant8,Jowie wrote a review Jun 2019,Jowie,,8 contributions,4 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Gan Island,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r682357827-South_African_Airways-World.html,Trip with a nightmare,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"So our flight to Jburg was delayed, apparently fog earlier in the day had had a knock on effect. These things happen, but what annoyed me was the companys attitude towards compensating customers when the delay went over 2 hours. Instead of announcing that customers were entitled to a meal and drink voucher, I had to find out for myself where to obtain this voucher from and because the airline had displayed a delay of exactly 2 hours all afternoon despite knowing full well it was a longer delay, they held off giving out vouchers until it was too late to obtain the meal and drink before boarding began by the time you'd queued and got a voucher.

SAA offer a good service, with the stretch out seats being fairly comfortable and allowing at least a bit of rest. The food on the flight was good as was the service. The negative is the entertainment system as its a bit limited in both movies but more specifically in its movie offering.

"Seating 2 - 4 - 2 across the fuselage meant very little room in which to rest. Putting the seat in recline position impacts immediately on those behind. Once one reclines it is necessary for all to do so. If eating there is no room to recline the seat in front. Foot room is totally inadequate.

The quality and selection of food was very poor, those who didn’t get served early on had no choice whatsoever! The positive was that the food was hot.

Whilst staff were pleasant welcoming us on board but after take off this changed to being dismissive and unhelpful. The food trolleys were stored at the back of the plane and travellers had to squeeze between them to access the toilets or to stretch their legs. The staff made no effort to move them to one side but ensured they were spread out for maximum effective disruption, they often glared at those who dared to try an move them slightly to enable them to squeeze through.

I will most certainly not be travelling by South African Airways in the future and this was echoed by those other travellers in our party.

The crew was wonderful, very attentive service, answered all our questions, and generally made the 15 hour flight enjoyable.  The downside was the use of a dated plane.  The seats were uncomfortable even in full lay down position, the seat adjusters were not smooth working, and the power plugs were either very loose (plug wouldn't stay in) or didn't work at all.  I tried both US and European plug adapters to no avail.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/50/d3/43/jim-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimH652,Jim H wrote a review Jun 2019,Jim H,"Macungie, Pennsylvania",57 contributions,27 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r679287448-South_African_Airways-World.html,Convenient with good service but a dated airplane.,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is a long haul flight, and South African Airways made it pretty good. The aircraft itself is not so cramped, so one can be comfortable sitting in pretty much any seat. Airline policy does not allow items under the seat, and this actually helps with legroom. A couple negatives include ridiculously low resolution on the individual video displays (I skipped their video system in favor of downloaded movies on my iPad), and oddly tight exit row seats. The exit row seats seemed a bit less deep (my legs extended quite a bit off of the seat), and the tray table did not extend very far forward (I am slim, and the tray basically touched my stomach). That said, the good included my ability to sleep eight hours (on a near 16 hour flight back to JFK), and the cabin crew are pleasant. One other thing... you cannot use any electronic device for the final ~30 minutes of any flight. This includes sound-cancelling headphones.

I was pleasantly surprised at the friendly stewards and stewardesses. I paid extra to sit at the exit row for the space so I could work during the flights. Sadly the space was virtually the same as the ""normal"" seating. All squashed in like sardines.

"We flew SAA from NYC to Cape Town (connecting in Johannasburg) and then from Cape Town to Hoedspruit/Hoedspruit to Johannasburg, then home to NYC.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience but felt the planes needed updating (the planes that made the long haul from NYC.  The smaller planes within South Africa were fine).  One monitor was not working properly and I was surprised the airline did not have USB ports for charging devices.  Some of the meals were better than others but either way did not care for the food.  The customer service on the other hand was the best I have ever experienced.  Attendants went out of their way to assist you with anything... even without asking.  I liked the fact that water was readily available for the taking since I get pretty dehydrated flying.  Of note, we were required to go through security yet again just prior to boarding the plane on our return to NYC.  I just purchased water for the plane and was not allowed to bring it on board (as it turned out they offered plenty on the plane anyway... unlike other airlines I have flown... so did not need to purchase).

Wow, what a great experience! The ground and flight crew were friendly, efficient and well presented, and the cabin was very clean, the seats spacious and comfortable. We boarded early and got to Cape Town 15 minutes before our estimated arrival time. Our luggage was out on the carousel in a matter of only a few minutes. Because of the lateness of me being booked onto the flight, I could not specify that I required a vegetarian meal but the crew were very accommodating and gave me a selection of fruit and yogurt.

"This is an email that I sent out at the end of March. It is now MAY 13th...close 2 MONTHS later and I have resent it multiple times to 2 SAA customer service emails, called multiple times, faxed it and still have not yet received a reply or even an acknowledgement!!

I am a Canadian who was on a trip to South Africa for 2 weeks. I had a wonderful time and then my trip ended with a very disappointing experience with South African Airways. I had a flight booked from Johannesburg to London (flight SA 234) with a final destination of Toronto the third week of March 2019. I checked myself in as well as a bag of luggage and went through security. I then went to the gate and the SAA employees at the gate saw me running and said that the gates had just closed at 8:40pm (flight was leaving at 8:55pm) and that they were going to offload my luggage now. The plane was still there and I asked for them to please help me either get on the flight or help me with next steps in getting back to Canada. The employees were dismissive. They were unwilling to help me get on that flight, obtain my luggage OR book a new flight and were extremely abrupt and unhelpful considering that I was in a foreign country alone and according to them ultimately needed to book a new flight for the next day, getting my home 24 hours later than expected. After being re-directed multiple times, I finally ended up at a SAA check-in desk with 1 employee available and the rest of desks were empty. I told the employee my situation and he told me that there was no way to help me out at this point and to book a hotel and come back tomorrow. He also would not help me book a new flight, said it was not possible to get my luggage back at this point and was extremely rude and patronizing in his demeanour. At this point, it was around 9:15pm and the airport had another flight leaving to Europe a few hours later which I was requesting to get on. It was evident he was not willing to help me out at all and made me feel unsafe, stranded and even more worried than I was before. Due to this interaction, I ended up booking a new flight with KLM/Delta to get home promptly and safely which was leaving at 11:55pm to Amsterdam and would have me back in Toronto, Canada the next day as originally expected. I have included both flight itineraries below for your reference and am requesting a full refund for the newly booked flight due to this extremely disappointing and anxiety provoking experience with the South African Airlines Employees.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1720HFtinat,Nic963 wrote a review May 2019,Nic963,"Toronto, Canada",2 contributions,3 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Toronto,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r673752215-South_African_Airways-World.html,No reply to incident for 1.5 months!!!,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The business class flight from  Johannesburg to Frankfurt 17 April was excellent.The return flight from Munich to Johannesburg on the 22nd of April was disappointing.The flight entertainment systems and adjustable electronic operated chairs did not work for the first 1,5 hours.

"After many hours of travel abroad I would often look forward to jumping onto an SAA plane, to seeing familiar faces and to enjoying the comfort of SAA business class which for many years was amongst the best in the world. Regrettably, this was not my experience on a recent return flight. Perhaps it is because I had just flown on a Cathay Dragon flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong on 10 May. The service on that flight was excellent! In particular the staff were polite and pleasant throughout the flight. The aircraft was modern and new. So, you can imagine how contrasting it was to board an SAA flight on an old aircraft that was already delayed, and to be greeted by glum faces. The pursor in particular looked grumpy. He refused to take my jacket indicating that other staff would do that. It was rare to see him smile for most of the flight. Other staff tried hard to please but the passion was just not there. I wondered if these were people just there to earn a living on an airline that is enjoying less and less support in recent times. Low staff morale was evident in comparison to other international airlines. The competition is fierce with Qatar, Singapore Airlines, Emirates and others leading the field. Yet, SAA prices are higher than their superior competitors!

There are only 3 toilets in business class and towards the end of the flight I was not allowed entry to a toilet in the front section. The grumpy pursor explained that it was blocked for crew.... however shortly after I was directed to the two occupied toilets at the back, 5 other foreigners were allowed access to the front toilet????

My breakfast was served very differently from previous flights. The tray with yoghurt, cereal and fruit was not served at all. Instead, i received the main course only. A croissant was served but without jam. I had to ask for items that previously were done automatically.

Needless to say the Hong Kong flight arrived late in JHB, the luggage arrived late and I had a few minutes to race from the international terminal to domestic to board. There was no place for my hand luggage which had to be sent to the hold. Probably because other passengers had been allowed on board with more luggage than is allowed...My checked luggage is in JHB. I am still awaiting its arrival, hoping it has not been pilfered at JHB international airport. Strangely these were not my experiences or concerns in Shanghai or Hong Kong airports where everything worked seemlessly! Such a pity that SAA is failing to save itself at one of the darkest moments in its economic history!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander816691,Meander816691 wrote a review May 2019,Meander816691,,57 contributions,38 helpful votes,Hong Kong - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r673404081-South_African_Airways-World.html,Bad Attitude at an altitude is harmful to airlines,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I flew from Perth to Nairobi via Johannesburg in business class and perhaps we have been spoiled by the service and aircraft on south East Asian Airlines. The food was mediocre, the flight attendants simply going through the motions and the aircraft, A340, was just about ready for the grave yard. I would suggest paying the extra and travelling for a longer time on one of the middle eastern airlines. SAA has fallen into a downward spiral in the last 10 years or so.

"During my just completed two month trip to Abu Dhabi, Oman, France and the USA, I flew with many of the big name carriers. My last flight of tge trip was with SAA.  What a pleasant surprise! Friendly ground staff with easy and effective boarding, departure on time and arrived ahead of schedule in a sparkling  clean Airbus,  very professional and hospital cabin crew that really cared for the passengers, great food and drinks served with stuke and a smile, real steel cutlery and not the cheap nasty plastic stuff I got on most of the other carriers.  The flight was smooth and the cockpit crew communicated well (and just enough) with the passengers.  Even the toilet paper was folded into that triangular end shape as they do in the better hotels.  To top it all each passenger got a socks, eyepad and toothbrush kit before takeoff.  Quality blankets and pillows together with a wide selection of movies and music made for a fairly  good  nightrest.  And all of this as an ordinary economy class passenger......  well done South African Airways.  After not flying with them for many years, they will now be my carrier of choice and I can highly recommend them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dkat777,DeonK@777 wrote a review May 2019,DeonK@777,"Johannesburg, South Africa",12 contributions,5 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r672640476-South_African_Airways-World.html,What a pleasabt surprise.

This is the most direct flight from SA to the USA.  Business class seats are very expensive and no longer represent good value for money.

The service was awesom! After take off we were served drinks and them a very tasty meal, followed by breakfast about two hours before arrival.

"Very, very poor customer service. Not one of the cabin crew had a smile, no interest in conversing with their passengers. My husband had to get up twice in the night to request a drink of water, the second time he was stretching his legs and was told to return to his seat as the steward wanted to sit back down to sleep!!
Never have I experienced such hostility from cabin crew from any other airline. Food was typical airline food, edible. Drinks were offered during 'waking hours'. Noone checked on passengers through the night. No duty free offered during the flight. They were the cheapest airline at the time so I guess you get what you pay for.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmacZ220DR,Emma C wrote a review May 2019,Emma C,So Wales,41 contributions,7 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r670891846-South_African_Airways-World.html,Awful,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was our return flight to Australia from South Africa. The flight to South Africa was 11 hours and very tiring (impossible to sleep). This return flight was scheduled for 9 hours - already looking good with a shorter flight time. Although the flight is not as long, it is still generally tiring since the flight leaves 9pm (South Africa time) and lands 6am (South Africa time) in Perth.
Like all airlines, a few days before departure SAA offers you to make a bid for an upgrade to Business Class.
This has always been a 'bucket list' for us (having never flown anything other than cattle class in the past) and we decided to make a bid - which was accepted. Hooray!!This was such a suprise for my daughter who was so excited with everything - not only the extra leg room.
Being offered champagne or orange juice when you first take your seat is a nice touch. After drinks are served, meals quickly follow. Meals are served as entrees, main and dessert.
Service is sensational and the food is well presented and reasonably good. We loved every minute of it.
Off course, having a bed that reclines is wonderful.
Breakfast was served about 1 1/2 hours before we landed in Perth.
The added bonus was that we were through customs in no time at all - a good experience all round!!!

"We were sent an offer to upgrade to Business class on our trip.

Our experience to Nairobi on SA184 was wonderful. The airport lounge at OR Tambo was great; the air steward on the flight was phenomenal and attentive the entire flight; he couldn't do enough to keep us comfortable. We had napkins on the trays to Nairobi and immediately when we were finished with our trays they were cleared and we were offered top-ups to our glasses throughout the flight.

The only issue was that there was no power in our row and so the earphones did not work so we could not watch the movie which was really a minor issue.

Flying on SA185 back to SA was totally appalling. We arrived at the airport at 13h30. We eventually went into the normal queue as Business Class was so slow. We were informed at the check in counter that the lounge was at gate 17, then gate 4....we eventually bought a packet of crisps and coffee at Java and proceeded to Gate 13 for check in at 14h50. On arrival at Gate 13, the priority desk was not manned and we had to stand in the normal queue for check in.

Boarding was meant to be at 15h00. We boarded at 15h15 with no-one indicating that there was a delay.

We were served once with no tray cloths and had to ask for top ups of drinks and apart from the initial service, we had no service from the attendants who sat talking and packing their bags..They also just left dirty trays on the side.

Since 19 March, still no satisfactory response after numerous e-mails and calls.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Collarsen,Colleen Larsen wrote a review Apr 2019,Colleen Larsen,,1 contribution,,Nairobi - Johannesburg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r670452507-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst Upgrade and Customer Experience,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have not flown with South African very often.  But I will definitely travel with them more. They are a great company.  They offer LOTS of options and times.  I have traveled a fair amount this month.  11 flights 15 days.  5 different airlines.  South African topped the list.This particular flight was FULL.   But the desk was great to keep us updated.  Both of our flights out of Johannesburg were delayed and running late.  I feel like they are just layed back at that airport.  The delay was over an hour and a half.  But the crew did everything they could to make it as good of an experience as possible.  Once we were boarded.  I was impressed.  Seats were larger than some.  The crew is amazing.  They WORK hard.  Even on our short hour and half flights they fed us drinks and snacks.  Snacks on some airlines is a small pretzel or treat which I usually decline.  This airline FED you.  A snack was a nice little crossiant with cheese and offered drinks generously.  This impressed me.  Seemed like they car about their customer service.I will definitely fly them more.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/08/2d/f6/trudi-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrudiH522,Trudi H wrote a review Apr 2019,Trudi H,"Rexburg, Idaho",199 contributions,17 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r670249170-South_African_Airways-World.html,Fabulous South African Trip,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A busy route, with only one carrier. The plane was not that old, but the seating and entertainment were straight out of British Airways in the 90s. Very limited movie and TV selection. Very narrow seat beds. Limited food choice. Poor service from cabin staff, with the purser sarcastic and verging on rudeness to some customers.

"We would definitely fly with SAA again.  We flew London to Livingstone via Jo'burg and return.  Everything was very punctual with smooth connections.  The return flight from Jo'burg to London was very impressive, the aircraft was an A340 and the seats and leg room were the most spacious we have experienced in economy.  It was a very comfortable flight, even managed to sleep a rare feat indeed!

"My wife and I arrived at O R Tambo Airport in Johannesburg via a connecting flight from Skukuza Airport in Kruger National Park.  Since we already had boarding passes issued at Skukuza, there was no check-in procedure at Johannesburg for the flight SA571 to Durban on 23rd March 2019.  Johannesburg Airport has a large food-court with restaurants from most major food-chains. We had lunch here since we had ample time before our flight scheduled to Board at 1625.

Legroom was adequate.  No screens.  The flight was not quite full.  After safety instructions, the plane took off smoothly on time at 1655.  Flight time was announced to be 60 minutes and the flying altitude 32000 ft.  The snack served was a sandwiched bun with a drink.  The flight landed smoothly on time in Durban at 1755.

"This was our first flight to South Africa. On our way to Cape Town, we flew from IAD to CPT with a fuel/clean up stop in Accra, Ghana (45-60 min). From Accra we flew another ~6 hours to Johannesburg where we deplaned, re-checked our bags, passed through customs, and then got our transfer flight to CPT. The plane we flew in from IAD to Jo-burg was new, had a lot of room and had an area in the bulk head where parents could attach a supplied crib for their babies. I thought that was a nice perk. Each seat had inflight entertainment and US plug ports and USB ports to charge phones. Our flight attendant, Nomsa, was extremely courteous and kind. She was with us from IAD to Accra before a different crew boarded in Accra.

Our return to the US was good as well, however we were on a more dated aircraft. The airline entertainment was finicky, though we managed to get through a movie. There were no ports for charging. Each time SA catered to my diet and were able to server vegetarian/vegan meals. I did put the request in prior to the flight, however. As with most airlines, if you don't make the request ahead of time, you can't guarantee they can meet your dietary requests. I also appreciated the goodie bag in economy all flights (outbound and return) that included socks, earplugs, eye covers, and a toothbrush and toothpaste. They also had pillows, blankets and a headset for all economy travelers. All staff were courteous and helpful. If I fly SA again, I'd just want to be sure to be on a newer plane due to the inflight entertainment and lack of USB ports.

We also reserved bulkhead and exit row seating in order to get extra leg room.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayLeadsOn2way,wayLeadsOn2way wrote a review Apr 2019,wayLeadsOn2way,"Raleigh, North Carolina",183 contributions,37 helpful votes,Washington DC - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r667230291-South_African_Airways-World.html,Overall good experience IAD to CPT and CPT to JFK on return,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We try to fly Star Alliance where we can and a planned holiday in Zimbabwe and Botswana. All flights were business class.

We left Auckland on SA7061 to Perth on 3 March (operated by Air NZ), followed by SA281 to Johannesburg. The plane for this flight was dated. The seats very uncomfortable, the inflight entertainment almost non-existent and unwatchable on screens of poor quality. The flight crew were not friendly and service was perfunctory. The meal service was barely edible. During the 6 hour layover at OR Tambo International Airport we used the SAA Lounge. Staff in the lounge were surly and unhelpful. The food service was minimal.

On the return journey, the flight from Maun to Johannesburg was pleasant and the cabin crew attentive and helpful, as well as apologetic for the fact that the flight was delayed.

It was difficult to imagine that the return flight from Johannesburg to Perth could be worse than the flight to Africa. But it was. For all of the reasons above. And more.

On both flights the business class cabin crew we came into contact with were all men. They appeared to be lost somewhere in the 1960s regarding attitudes and service of female passengers.

We fly frequently in business class on Star Alliance and other airlines. The overall experience with SAA was not at a business class level. The cost of the flights was also well in excess of flights of similar duration on other routes.

We had a wonderful holiday in Africa and have already made plans to return. We will not be returning with SAA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJB9193,PJB9193 wrote a review Apr 2019,PJB9193,"Auckland, New Zealand",44 contributions,28 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r666748837-South_African_Airways-World.html,Perth to Johannesburg Return - don't do it!!,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have never come across a more unprofessional, inefficient airline in my life. After having unplanned surgery days before my flight, I couldn't make my flight. As a result, (and including the travel insurance which I bought) I could not change my flight without paying the entire fee of the flight again and could not cancel my flight and get a refund on my booking. After calling in and being on hold, I spoke to an extremely rude and agitated woman who did not understand - and could not answer - my basic questions. I was told that if I were a gold-card member that I would be able to change my flight but as I am ""just"" an economy member, there is nothing they can do for me. After asking to speak to a manager I was put on hold for 30 minutes and eventually decided to write this review. SAA are crooks.

"South African Airways offers the fastest and shortest flight to Africa from New York. I toured Namibia in March. I flew from JFK to JNB (15 hr) then JNB to WDH (2 hr). Other airlines just take way too long to reach Windhoek. Although my 2 flights were booked separately, they were easily linked when I checked in.  My luggage went directly to the final destination without having to go thru the immigration/recheck-in process which is a nice benefit. I flew economy to JNB. The seat was comfortable and came with a travel pouch which is nice. Food was ok but the entertainment system (hardware) was horrible to use. Took 10 minute to navigate each time, can tell it has some ages, both remote and touch screen were not very sensitive. I flew business class on the way back using their step-up upgrade program. The flat seat was very much needed for a red eye flight. Seat was very comfortable and I had a good sleep. Food was ok.

"SAA seriously needs to review its training policies and take a page from Singapore Airlines since they are both in Star Alliance. With SIA despite having flown economy numerous times, I can safely say, they are still VERY comfortable. Alas none can be said for SAA. The seats are cramped and the cushioning on the seats are thin, making any form of rest impossible.

The inflight entertainment touchscreen display was unpredictable, requiring numerous taps on the screen to get it to respond, or not at all. It is a very frustrating experience. Friends of mine who were seated in front me, could not get their screens to work at all, and when they raised the issue with the flight attendant, they merely shrugged and apologized, and that was it. Too bad seems to be the silent communication coming from them. When I had a similar experience on SIA a few years ago, they not only moved my seat to a working monitor but also gave me vouchers to use with their shopping service.

The flight attendants were pretty sassy and not in the cute and fun way. Most seems to be stressed and frustrated, and they rarely smile. When my friends and I compared notes, we all agree that the crew seems to be an unhappy lot.

Food wise, it was nothing to rave about. In fact, they announced the menu options available, and the cargo load of their availability. I.e. Vegetarian is 10%, chicken is 40% and beef is 50%. So if you are vegetarian and did not indicate so prior to boarding, good luck. While this is not entirely a deal breaker, it feels like a lack of effort compared to other airlines who will go all out to get you the meal you want, some even improvised to create something just so they know their passenger is fed. Not SAA.

Another problem is the lack of options. SAA only has business and economy for the JFK flight. It will be nice if they can invest in creating a premium economy class that is less than business but more than economy. This is because the price difference between economy and business pretty extremely.

On the flight back, the entertainment system did not work, but after 2 weeks in Africa without watching television, I did not miss it much.

"My SAA experience has to be seen in the context that they only provided the last leg of a Star Alliance/Egyptair flight from Cyprus to Cape Town via Cairo and Johannesburg.This review includes time in both JNB and CPT airports where what went wrong was, strictly speaking, a matter for the airport not the airline. A national airline such as SAA does however have a lot of power to influence things. They do not bother!

JNB is the only airport in the world of which I am aware which will not check your luggage through to final destination. I need a wheelchair. The driver had to push me and all of my luggage between terminals. 1 star!

Insanely, there are separate wheelchair operations for the international and domestic terminals at JNB. I Was delivered to the domestic terminal by the excellent assistant who met me from the plane. I then had to wait 45 minutes before there was another wheelchair available to take me to the lounge. 1 star!

Business class on the domestic flight to CPT was excellent. 5 stars!

CPT has a large number of female wheelchair pushers. They are very good. Nelson Mandela would have been proud. 5 stars for supporting diversity!

The SAA return from CPT to JNB was 90 minutes late. There is no excuse for that on a short flight on the natlonal airline between the country’s 2 largest cities. Despite similarly good service on board to the 1st leg that merits 1 star!

We were promised that, as there were 17 passengers transferring from SAA to Egyptair that Egyptair would wait for us. Remember that both SAA and Egyptair are Star Alliance members. They did not do so. They left on time. All 3 wheelchair passengers missed the flight despite the pushers running the whole way, as did 4 others. 1 star!

Egyptair, illegally, left for Cairo without offloading the luggage for the 7 people who had missed the flight. It took 5 days for my luggage to get from Cairo to Cyprus. Minus 10 stars, though for Egyptair not SAA.

It took till 1AM for the excellent SAA employee who was left to sort out my affairs to do so. Money was no object. There was no Egyptair flight the next day. She booked me on a business class one way flight from JNB to Larnaca in Cyprus via Dubai on Emirates. Not cheap. She also booked me into the most expensive hotel at JNB, the Intercontinental, which is only 50 metres from the front door of the terminal. 5 stars!

SAA still managed to mess up every piece of paperwork they could.Just one example, when I tried to check in on Emirates, I could not do so. They eventually discovered that SAA had booked me 2 separate flights on the same plane from JNB to Dubai and nothing at all to get me from Dubai to Cyprus. 1 star.

Lots of 5 stars and lots of 1 stars. The only fair overall rating is to split the difference and give the overall experience 3 stars!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bifrons,bifrons wrote a review Apr 2019,bifrons,"Paphos, Cyprus",277 contributions,165 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r664292091-South_African_Airways-World.html,FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My daughter was advised not to fly back to Australia after a serious bout of gastroenteritis. After an appointment with our family GP she was told that due to her temperature and frequent need to use the lavatory on such a long flight it would be advisable to delay her flight back by at least 24 hrs if not 48. After countless phone calls to SAA in Johannesburg and at reservations SAA at OR Tambó International Airport, we were given numerous different suggestions as to what to do. Eventually after no luck and different advice, my daughter went to the airport and was treated with the utmost contempt. Not only did they reject her doctor’s letter and proof of antibiotic medication and other bought, they did not want to let her on the flight and could not ensure where her luggage would arrive! I am absolutely astounded after being told by our doctor that she should under no circumstances fly as a risk to herself and other passengers, that her letter was totally disregarded and she was treated with contempt. This treatment is totally unacceptable and I will not rest until further action has been taken to ensure it does not happen to other poor sick fliers. This was the email I sent to customer service at SAA and have had no reply at all.

"For some reason I did not get the direct flight from Cape Town to Mauritius so had to go via Jo'burg. Out of these four flights 3 were on time and 2 benefited from tailwind. Economy is never pleasant but a smile from the crew would help. I don't recall a single smile from anyone on all 4 flights. They performed their duty but without any enthusiasm or élan. I was even asked to put the trash into the trolley myself (it was my neighbours). the tone was arrogant and condescending. Really unnecessary especially if they are trying to grow tourism in RSA.

Our flight was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately the good business class service provided by the staff is let down by the older style cabin.

In our case we were transferred out to the charter flight hangar at 5:30 in the morning where we arrived to pitch darkness and had a 5 1/2 hour wait before our charter flight out to the game park.

"Flight SA 8404. Check in was done by a very friendly stuardess but there seems to be a Constant confusion if Star Alliance baggage allowance apply or not. Carefull when you come from Europe or elswhere you can easyely fall into the baggage trap. If you come with a Business flight and you stay a couple of days for example in Johannesburg and you want to take a flight to other Locations in South Africa, then you pay exorbitant for over weight luggage. South African Express or Airlink which one Books through South African Airways are not respecting Star Alliance baggage allowance. If you want to Travel with the same luggage through South Africa and you have even two suitcases you came with, the you pay ridiculas amounts for exess luggage.

"I often used SAA (at least twice a month) 4 years ago and it was one of the best airlines in the region. This time round the seats were in bad condition (paint was scratched), and they were extremely close together. Flying to Lusaka there air hostess was very unkept and very loud spoken. On the way back the steward was very professional and friendly. And the aircraft was newer, leather seats or at least they looked like leather. The food was not good but the wine was enjoyable.

"There was a pact of salami on my husband's seat. No, seriously there was! When he took it to the steward, she shrugged and took it from him. It wasn't the best start and
not being able to adjust the temperature at my seat didn't make things better. The narrow, hard seats didn't help either. When the person in front of me tipped his seat back the t.v. screen was so close that, even with reading glasses, I wasn't able to focus.
When an announcement tells you that dinner is being served and that it your first choice is not available you'll enjoy your second choice just as much, you can't help but feel that you're not going to get what you want. And we didn't. Actually we didn't get our second choice either and felt very lucky t that there was anything available.
I have no idea where the cabin crew disappeared to between 11pm and 5am but I couldn't get a drink.

"Flew Heathrow to Johannesburg return on this airline economy class. The seats had no padding and after only an hour was suffering severe discomfort in lower back. The headrest was too high to comfortably rest head on and angled so that it pushes head forward, I am an average height person. Very little legroom and when passenger in front reclined seat the tv screen was about 4 inches from my face. Food was well below average and announcements were made that if our first choice meal wasn’t available then the second choice would be just as tasty!
Found the cabin crew sullen and unhelpful, it seemed that they wanted to get the service over as quickly as possible so they could turn the lights off and go and sit in the back and do nothing.
Partway through the flight I walked to the rear to request a bottle of water - the crew member was sitting with her eyes closed and when I made my request she rolled her eyes and sighed.
Towards end of flight the rubbish in a huge plastic bag was outside the toilet and passengers were having to push past it or step over it to go into the toilet.
Not once during the night did a crew member walk the aisles to check passengers were ok or needed anything.
Breakfast was served about 90 mins before landing with nothing to drink until about 20 mins later.
I would not recommend this airline and certainly won’t be travelling with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliajyne,juliajyne wrote a review Mar 2019,juliajyne,"Halifax, United Kingdom",28 contributions,13 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r658796481-South_African_Airways-World.html,Never again!,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew out of Buffalo to JFK on March 1st to catch a flight to Johannesburg then in to Livingstone. I knew going in that we were on an older plane going, but I did not expect it to be as bad as it was. We were delayed out of JFK for no apparent reason which meant we had to run through the Johannesburg airport to catch our connection. We barely made it. For the first hour of the long haul flight it was ok. Dinner was served at noon and it was delicious. The flight attendants were kind and courteous. No issues there. Once we got past that is when it took a turn. The seat was like sitting on a piece of wood with no padding and the seats are very narrow. I’m not a huge guy but not a little guy and I was getting squeezed by the arm rests the whole time. It was impossible to get comfortable sitting back in the seat because my tailbone was on fire. When the person in front of you reclined any prayer of leg room went out the window. I ended up using my neck pillow on the seat as a donut to sit on, it was that bad. About 6pm local time EST they shut the lights off and “put everyone to bed” then they came around 8 with a dried out half sandwich for dinner. That was the last time we saw a flight attendant until breakfast. If you wanted something to drink you had to go find a sleeping attendant near the galley to get it. It was impossible to stay hydrated on this flight. The entertainment was horrible! The touch screen was as responsive as a gen 1 iPad and the selection was awful. I could only watch Invictus so many times lol. Breakfast came around an hour before the flight ended and seemed decent but I was so sick at that point from lack of sleep and dehydration I decided throwing up in the bathroom was a better option. Once we made it to Johannesburg the flight on SAA from there to Livingstone was fine. Nicer plane, smooth ride, no issues.

The return trip home to Dulles from Johannesburg was a bit easier. It was a newer plane and had a better entertainment system. The seats were a bit more comfortable but the cabin temp was all over the place. Neither of the planes had individual vents or any charging ports at all. Luckily we had battery packs with us.
The operating procedure for the attendants was the same, there for a bit and then non existent. About the middle of the night I asked for water and they were out with 5 hours left on a 17 hour flight. How do you run out of water?

Overall, my mission trip was amazing, but I will avoid SAA at all costs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/05/6c/3f/michael-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truetopath,Michael D wrote a review Mar 2019,Michael D,"Lake View, New York",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Buffalo - Livingstone,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r658213896-South_African_Airways-World.html,Horrible flight experience,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The cabin crew were really good. Food fine. The hectoring by the passenger instructions were unfriendly and unique to SAA- I fly a lot, no one else has such a threatening manner, told like a child to do up seatbelts on empty seats, store plastic carefully, etc..

Then the secondary screening at the gate - not sure why it is even necessary, as my bag had been screened twice within the previous two hours, but when a person there says my see through plastic bag is not a Ziploc and I must go and buy one and come back later - when that bag has been though Sydney Heathrow Auckland etc. , that is ridiculous.

"Most of the passengers of this flight were African Anericans returning from a cultural event. The east Asian attendant aggressively started a confrontation with a young man because he assumed that putting his phone in airplane mode was sufficient before take off, she wanted him to turn the phone completly off. She spoke to him in a way that was very condescending from the start, and as others tried to kindly assist she began doing the same to everyone, saying things like ""Where I am from we understand/do..."" She eventually threated to have ppl arrested if they didn't have their phones off. We requested a different attendant for our section and it was granted. Such a bad ending to an awesome trip.

"Chose to fly South African for the first time when we usually fly either BA or Virgin. Very comfortable business cabin and pod with a good layout and good in-flight menu and food. Service was attentive and helpful. The cabin crew really make the difference as on the outbound flight SA235 on the 12 February the cabin crew were lethargic, disorganized and lazy. The 'commander' on this flight was a master at sleep disturbance with unnecessary announcements. However, on SA234 on the 6 March we had a 'captain' and he and his crew managed the flight in an excellent manner. Will most certainly choose to fly SAA again with fingers crossed that we don't get the lethargic, disorganized and lazy cabin crew - perhaps SAA will have identified them by then and retrained them?!

"My trip to SA in 2018 was a little bit decided on the spot, and unlike the yesr before, the budget didn't allow me to fly with BA in wt+, and SAA was by far cheapest when i booked, so i gave them a go as they looked ok fron pictures. Via munich outbound on their 330-200, boarding was a breeze. Seats i thought was on par with other economy-offerings out there, I'm 6'2. The only thing on this outbound flight was the temperature onboard, it was way to chilly. Many of the passengers were freezing. Flying in from Norway in November, i luckily had some warm clothing to put back on
Other then that, a pretty eventless and smooth flight all the way. Homebound I flew via London, wich meant their brand new 330-300. Ife-screen bigger and better, seats to me felt more comfortable. Temperature on this flight was good. Food and drinks and service i found on par with other airlines in economy.

"We flew long haul (about 10hrs) from Australia to SA and back.

Pros: The staff were great, very efficient and professional. Meal services and cleanup afterwards were executed perfectly.

Cons: the entertainment system was quite faulty on both flights, for both of us, which I suspect is because the aircraft are clearly quite old and worn. It was difficult to get sound on the entertainment system, the plug had to be held in a magic position. The choice of movies etc was also pretty small.

Our flight home from Johannesburg was one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. We had booked and paid for extra legroom seats which had been confirmed prior to leaving Australia. On boarding we were seated in a bulk head row that had less than normal legroom due to the nature of the bulk head. We complained prior to takeoff and nothing was done to move us. After takeoff we were offered two seats in the back row of the aircraft despite there being many vacancies further forward in the aircraft which by this time people had taken over and were sleeping across. My partner took the backseat as he was unable to move his bad leg in the allocated seat and needed to be able to stretch his bad knee. I however couldn’t stay in the middle seat between two very large people and returned to my allocated seat.  There were four of ya travelling together and only 1 of the four video screens worked on a 10 hour flight - unacceptable. There was very little water or fluids on offer during the flight. My husband was constantly bumped by the flight attendant as he moved from the galley with little apology.

The captain made an announcement that they would set the temperature warmer but it was still very cold inside the plane. I then asked the hostess if there was not a blanket that I could buy or if she can give me any cloth to cover me. I had cold fever and was shivering. At this point Craig Groepes were shouting across the aisle  that I should not harass his staff. He then came to me and said the airline would contact me. I told him that he was very unprofessional by shouting at a passenger  in front of other passengers and that I am going to report him for what it is worth. He just kept on telling me sarcastically that I should enjoy my flight. It was the worse flight of my life and I had to go to the doctor directly after we landed. I had severe fever and had to stay in bed for longer than a week. Needless to say, SAA never contacted me. I also just want to mention that after millions of miles in the air this was the first time that  I had a problem with crew members. I also have to mention that this was my first trip with SAA in many years because of their poor service. I plan never to use them again. When I told my doctor about this poor service, he told me that he also never use them because of their unprofessional service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/58/9b/7a/louw60.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louw60,Louw60 wrote a review Feb 2019,Louw60,"Hermanus, South Africa",6 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r655176637-South_African_Airways-World.html,Unprofessional uncaring cabin crew,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We chose South African Airline because the flight schedule and price fitted best. After reading mediocre reviews, we were a bit sceptic, but it turned out to be a quite good experience. Flight was pleasant. Staff was very friendly, seats comfortable with decent leg space, food surprisingly good. True, the aircrafts and rhe entertainment system are a bit dated, but we'll maintained and not (yet) outdated.

We would happily use SAA again. It is not as good as it was 12 years ago, when we flew SAA for the first time, but it is much better than it was 6 years ago.

The flight crew were friendly and efficient but the food was very average, nowhere near the standard of meals served on most major airlines. Both flying to Jo'burg and returning to Perth the video system did not work so we were unable to watch movies. One good thing was that the flights left and arrived on time so it was not completely negative. However, if and when I fly again to South Africa I will be booking with  another airline rather than having to put up with SAA again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/31/48/ad/ouestmj.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ouestmj,ouestmj wrote a review Feb 2019,ouestmj,"Perth, Australia",143 contributions,115 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r652680435-South_African_Airways-World.html,Take a cushion to sit on,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"What a pleasure writing to you 😊

I believe in giving credit when credit is due. People always have the means to complain about service but never really complement on good service.

I flew SAA on the 18th of January 2019 on flight SA372 from Cape Town to Johannesburg on very short notice as my father suddenly passed away in the Free State.

When I boarded the plane, to my utmost astonishment, I was the only passenger on the aircraft, that made me smile from a day that was dreadful...

And then... The service I had received from the staff was super! (Senior Purser, Vusi Lunga and his assistant) - picture attached- They had found out of my dad's passing in some way and all came and gave their condolences. Even the Captin over the intercom gave his condolences.

I was so surprised at the attention to detail that I had been served with. The host that that served me, when placing the napkin down, made 100% sure that the logo faced me, the softdrink I received had the logo facing me and even the glass was presented in line with the napkin.

The friendliness and passion that I was served in was immaculate! I've been working in hospitality for many years, and I pick up on small details that people usually miss, but not on this flight.

It was the most pleasant 2 hours of my day and I would really like to thank each and every person that was on that flight to make it so spectacular!

I have never flown with SAA yet, but after this experience, you can be guaranteed that you have a regular passenger that will be using your services, and I will tell everyone about the great service!!

"The check-in area was confusing for first time users.  The lounge was very nice and had a great selection of foods and drinks and extremely helpful staff, but that is where the good bit ended. boarding staff were not very helpful or friendly and it was quite a shock to walk into the cabin, with most of the seats looking tired and worn the seat in front of me had bits of padding hanging out. The carpet was worn and in desperate need of replacement. The so called entertainment was a T.V. on the bulkhead two rows in front, which you could not hear or attempt to see.  The fold out foot rest was very difficult to use and it took two people pushing it to get it back in when required  No earphones or earplugs meant a very noisy flight staff seemed very disinterested in the passengers. The cold drinks were warm and the coffee was not nice at all.  Could not wait to get off the plane, but to add insult to injury one of our cases had been damaged in transit (handle completely ripped off and missing.  A wheel hanging off and totally useless)  went to the baggage area only to be told that we had to claim it on our travel insurance and the best they could do was give us a report number.

"This was our first time flying SAA ever, from what I have heard they are great for affordable flights to and from South Africa as well as within SA. If that is your only concern you are 100% set to go.

For those of you whome like travel comforts, this may not be the airline for you. Prior to our travel I researched SAA quite a bit, their website boasts luxury and creature comforts even for economy passengers, what we received for both 14+ hour flights was horrendous:
1. there were no USB ports to charge your phone, so attempting your own audio without a portable battery is out.
2. The screens were older than most of the passengers, remember the old screens you have to look at from just the right angle to see the picture, yupp that is what you get; on a plus side they do have updated movies but that was about the only plus. (We Traveled in Jan 2018 and had access to titles like Dead Pool 2, Crazy Rich Asians, Darkest Minds etc.
3. The seats were so dated they still had a dual port headphone jack so you are not able to use your own to watch said movies, and the arm rests only went up about 3/4 of the way, so if you want to snuggle up to a traveling companion or stretch across multiple seats to sleep, good luck there as well.
If you are thinking in participating in their step up Program to get into business class, I would caution against it, here's why - I requested the link be emailed to me because we were undecided on if we were going to upgrade our seats. We had a total of four with SAA and decided to bid to upgrade the last two legs; two hours from Cape Town, and 16 hours from JoBerg to JFK. I submitted the request and provided my card details as required and throughout the whole process was promised no charges would be taken unless the upgrade was processed. Turns out to be 100% false.
While traveling in SA from the states my mobile service was not great (getting multiple emails at once even though they were sent at different times), so I sent the email with my request and was advised should we receive the upgrade we would receive a confirmation email and our card would be charged. Upon arrival at the airport I had not received and email yet but was able to login to my account and see my card had been charged. I thought great! Better seats, maybe better screens, for sure at least a USB port to charge my cell.
We arrive to the check in counter and low and behold they had taken the money from my account but REFUSED to give me the seats, the reps at the airport stated we have to contact customer care becuase even though they can see the chrage on my statement that says SAA Step Up Program, it has to reflect the change in their system. So after 30 minutes on hold we gave up our fight in fear of missing the flight and decided and email to SAA explaining what happened would get the refund processed and ensure no similar issue for the longer flight. Again, unfortunately we were 100% wrong upon check in we were told again we only had economy seats even though I showed the rep my statement showing the $3000+ chrage on my card. We were told we were out of luck because customer service was closed and would have to wait until they open, which just so happened to be while we would be in the air.

So as a cautionary tale be careful in setting your expectations, they are not likely to meet them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dlav2,WorldTravler wrote a review Feb 2019,WorldTravler,"San Antonio, Texas",3 contributions,3 helpful votes,Johannesburg - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r650414175-South_African_Airways-World.html,Most Outdated Airline I have ever been on.,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The SAA business lounge at Johannesburg airport was appalling!

Rather fly with another airline, so you will at least get a more pleasant stay-over at this airport.

The personnel are talking extremely loud with each-other with little regard and bluntly ignoring travelers trying to get some rest.

I asked for decaf cappuccino and VERY small sachet of instance cappuccino was stuffed into my hand!!! When I asked that I rather be served with a normal cut of cappuccino this African woman look at me in a very irritable manor, turned her back on me and started to make the cappuccino. It was then slapped down onto the counter in front of me, again.. ignoring me as if I do not exist.

There could not possibly have been any kind of supervision there, because I cant think for a minute that that kind of behavior will be allowed. Unless the supervisor was in on it??

The service during flight was acceptable but I have experience better service on most other airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/a5/27/d5/kobus-v.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kareeblom,Karee wrote a review Jan 2019,Karee,,5 contributions,,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r648784367-South_African_Airways-World.html,Flying South African Airways from Johannesburg to Mauritius - Return,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

SAA gets better and better and this flight was an absolute joy. Eleven hours in the air is not exactly anybody's idea of fun but South African make it as painless as possible.

"I am an avid traveler and understand that there can be issues that pop up while flying. I have never experienced anything that has ever led me to write a poor review on TripAdvisor before. However, I recently used SAA's services for flights between Lilongwe & Cape Town and then Cape Town to Entebbe...and these experiences we're not just the worst flying experience...but my worst travel and customer service of my life. I had multiple issues along the way and when I approached, called, or emailed SAA about trying to get them fixed I was met with hostility. Never once was there an apology, explanation, or fix to any of my issues. I had so many problems I don't have time to address them all. But it started with SAA losing my babies carseat, stroller, and crib...and not being able to replace them. As you can imagine, this presented multiple challenges...including even getting ourselves to our hotel (without a safe seat for our baby). I had used SAA pretty frequently in the past (over ten years ago) and always had pleasant experiences. We love visiting South Africa, but if this is what it takes to get there I would at least recommend flying other airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidsI6663QM,David S wrote a review Jan 2019,David S,STL,25 contributions,3 helpful votes,Lilongwe - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r648358640-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst Traveling Experience I've Ever Experienced,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We travel a lot, to all corners of the world, and its always business class so we have experienced the offerings of many airlines and frankly our experience on SAA 308 was not good.

To those who commute from North America to South Africa and vice versa haev all experienced the nightmare of 2 nights in the air regardless of class traveled. Only 2 airlines offer a one night optoin - SAA from the US and KLM through Europe. We have done the latter and it a very good connection, excellent experience and equipment. This time we opted for the SAA option flying from Dulles.

Our flight from Toronto was delayed and we were the last to board after a mad scramble across the airport. Luckily the flight was delayed by 45 minutes so we were not too embarrassed. However that was where the service problems kicked in and let the airline down badly.

Despite the delay, we were not offered the customary champagne nor the hand towels. Sounds silly and a bit snobbish but we pay a premium for the creature comforts. After take off, the pilot came over the intercom system and welcomed passengers and invited us to sit back and relax and enjoy the flight. It seemed the flight attendants took the matter to heart for it was almost 1 hour before the first drinks arrived. Having been through what we endured, it seemed like an eternity.

The meal was very good and we managed to catch an hour's sleep before we landed in Dakar. After 90 minutes on the ground we were airborne again but since we were exhausted we fell asleep before take off.

We awoke 3 hours into the flight feeling rather hungry. When we asked after the breakfast service we were advised that we had missed that and would have to wait for the snack just before landing - however feel free to help yourself to the crisps and cookies.

That was my last international flight on SAA, from now on in will be KLM which offers only 1 night in the air",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/a1/b8/da/brian-e.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianE91,Brian E wrote a review Jan 2019,Brian E,"Toronto, Canada",214 contributions,122 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r648272609-South_African_Airways-World.html,Disappointing Business Class on Flught from Washington,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The crew was very friendly and accommodating. They made 16 hours feel like 6. The cabin was clean and didn't have a smell which is always good. The seats are really basic size now extra legroom either. The flight from JFK I sat in the back by the bathrooms and it got annoying when I tried to sleep always hearing the toilet flush or the crew in the galley. There is no wi-fi which made this journey very long. There is some old in-flight entertainment. the movies and shows were old but if you never watched them it was okay. The food was regular airline food, nothing spectacular, nothing seasoned. They did have vegetarian options available and served dinner, snack and breakfast.

"WORST AIRLINE EVER! DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE. I PAID and additional $1,340.00usd FOR A BUSINESS CLASS SEAT - Booking JM4CYU and the seat was broken. I had to sit up in a broken seat that was more then flat for almost 16 hours!. Not only did the flight attendant, Lebon and the pilot said i would get a full refund to write a letter. WHich i did on September 27, 2018 and called many people there including Anay Miller - Manager of Support Services, e-mailed over 40 people at the company, including Julia Serafim - Manager of Customer Service Recovery, but they offered me, half of what i paid for the upgrade. in addition to: 1. The saa lounge in jfk was dirty disgusting, bugs flying around on the food, the glasses were not properly washed and the showers were boarded up. (i failed to take pictures because i was hoping that this would be the only issue i would have.

The business class flight from JFK - JNB on 9/11/2018, seat 6D:

The chair was not working properly. I told the stewardess and they rudely ignored me. Not all of the footrest buttons were working and the massage did not work, i was able to get the bed to go from sitting, to cradle to laying down

The economy class flight from VFA-JNB seat on 9/23/2018, seat 49K:

served lunch and there was a black hair in my pasta. I have light brown hair - If you like hair in your food, fly this airline.

The business class flight from JNB - JFK on 9/23/2018 seat 7A :

The whole wall was filthy with visible something or other all over it. I told the stewardess and he gave me something to clean it off.

The center top was filthy

The seat was literally falling apart, dirty, and the leather was wearing away

My seat did not work at all - pay for a seat that turns into a bed- so you can sleep for 16+ hours, and you get a broken seat and NO REFUND!

"The plane was delayed for 2 hours, and then when I went to the boarding gate, it had been delayed even more.
The stairs to the plane are so steep, and so difficult to climb, that I had to get assistance to climb (yes, literally climb) up them. I only had a small overnight bag with me.
The plane was almost empty, maybe a dozen passengers, and I asked the stewardess if I could change seats.(all the passengers were put together in the middle of the plane, 2 in each row) but she said I could only change after the plane had taken off, as the weight had to be evenly distributed during take off. I may be a couple of kgs overweight, but am not huge, and argued with her that my weight would not make a difference, but no, she would not let me move.

"Checked-in at JNB with a few hours to spare. Travelling as part of a Group Tour but the others all in economy class. After check-in, went to the (rather average) Business Class Lounge and relaxed. The flight was due to depart at 1010hrs and boarding was supposed to begin around 09.40. At the required time we began to make our way to the gate, but noticing that the 'Now Boarding' sign was NOT displayed, we took our time. The gate was downstairs (a bus to the aircraft) and as we came down the escalator the sign above the gate began to show ""Boarding"". As we approached the gate - passports and Boarding Passes in hand, the gate attendant turned the sign to ""Closed"" and turned around to physically close the gate. Even though we pleaded to be allowed to board the waiting bus (our fellow group members were onboard the bus waiting to travel to the aircraft), the female attendant simply said ""you're late, flight is closed and your bags are being taken off"". This despite the fact that the clock in the departure lounge clearly showed the time to be 1005 - 5 minutes before the flight was due to close. Over the course of the next few hours we had to make several phone calls to Australia to try and get help. SAA were only interested in letting us travel 24 hours later - which was not an option for us as the group were due to leave Nairobi for a game park early the next day. So...we had to travel on an Air Kenya flight - economy class - and spend more than AU$700 per person for the fare JNB-NBO. A complaint has been made to SAA and has been acknowledged (more than 3 months ago) but we have heard absolutely nothing from them since. However, we HAVE heard from various sources that they often close the gate early to try and retain an on-time departure record. All-in-all the attitude of every member of staff we encounter that day was appalling - nobody seemed to care and nobody wanted to even try to help. We will certainly never consider flying with South African Airways again.

"Just have to tell this story about the service from an SAA agent on our recent trip to South Africa.

It was my 10th time in SA. I’m an American married to a South African, so we come home every year to see family and friends. We booked our air flights on Expedia, and found ourselves at the Cape Town airport (CPT) on January 5th, headed back to JNB, with an itinerary that read “Hahn” as the airlines. I quickly realized that there is no such airlines. We asked for help and were told maybe it was Mango or Safair, but after going to both of those airline counters, we were told that we were not booked on either airline. We did not know what to do. It was 5:00 AM, and we were meant to fly at 6:40 AM. We decided to ask a woman at the SAA counter, if possibly we were on that airline. Sadly, we were not… but what happened next was nothing short of amazing!

She took it upon herself to figure out what had happened to our reservations and what flight we were on. I handed her our itinerary and my phone (which had info on it), and she took off, literally running around the airport, trying to find a solution. We watched with tired eyes as she ran from one end of the counters to the other, inquiring with multiple airlines. Meanwhile, we were losing hope, and believed we would simply have to buy new tickets, and try to take it up with Expedia when we returned to the USA.

After about 15 minutes, she returned with a printout, and like a miracle, had FOUND OUR FLIGHT!!! We were in fact flying on Safair, but not until 8:35 AM. Being both tired and stressed, I burst into tears of joy. She’d saved us! And, we weren’t even flying SAA!!! Who would help a customer that was not even their customer?

I thanked her profusely and asked her to write down her name. If I am reading it correctly, her name is Gloria Julius. She is clearly great at her job and customer service, and we would love for her to be acknowledged, recognized, and maybe rewarded by SAA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnd643,dawnd643 wrote a review Jan 2019,dawnd643,"San Francisco, California",12 contributions,7 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r646852542-South_African_Airways-World.html,Amazing Customer Service,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We like flying South African Airways as we are Star Alliance gold members.  We were disappointed when we booked an SAA flight to George that none of our Star Alliance Gold privileges applied to the code share Mango flight.  This was the whole reason for booking on SAA and not one of the cheaper airlines was that we wanted the extra weight allowance for our suitcases that the Star Alliance privilege would give us.  Unfortunately even though you book SAA, the flight is actually Mango and their rules apply.  This also means no access to the SAA lounge.  We flew with golf clubs and when you book on SAA, because of the code share you cant add extra luggage pieces to the online check in on Mango. (If you book direct with Mango you can).  This means that we had to check in at Mango, go to another counter to pay the overweight on the luggage and then come back to the Mango check in again.  It seems like the process just needs to be reviewed and fixed otherwise people should just book directly with Mango as there are no benefits to booking with SAA for Star Alliance customers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahL8335,Sarah L wrote a review Jan 2019,Sarah L,"Arlandastad, Sweden",12 contributions,10 helpful votes,Johannesburg - George,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r646499617-South_African_Airways-World.html,Code share with Mango needs improvement,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Horrible airline.  I have never flown with this many restrictions before. No under seat luggage. Blankets and pillows cannot be worn or used during take off or landing and once again cannot be placed on the floor under the seat in front of you. The seats cannot be booked in advance which is a big deal for my husband and I. He is very tall and literally cannot fit in regular seats. So we have to book bulk head or exit row in advance. The seats were the most uncomfortable airplane seats I have ever sat in.

"We were skeptical when we learned that our return flight from Frankfurt was on an SAA fllght, but we were nicely surprised with the good service we received.  I am not sure if the good experience was directly related to the excellent guidance of the head steward in charge, or was it due to a new strategy to improve service on board all SAA flights.  We could immediately tell that the person in charge was experienced, professional, organised and very efficient.  The food was also very good.   Tasty and well prepared (for airline food).  The serving of food and drinks were quick.

"Staff on the plane are friendly so I can't really complain about the flight. Not the best current and up to date entertainment system, but this is a minor issue in the greater scheme of life.

The ground staff on the other hand, especially at the ticket desk, leave much to be desired. SAA changed our connecting flight through Sao Paulo so that there was an hour to catch our connecting flight to Johannesburg. We previously argued with SAA over the phone that this change was unreasonable and that something would go wrong, but they insisted that this was the only flight they could change us to.

We arrived in Sao Paulo from Buenos Aires (yes - that flight was delayed), had to run to get through security to reach our next flight, and of course, upon landing in Johannesburg, our bags were still in Sao Paulo. Not the end of the world, as we were arriving back home. We were told the bags would be delivered to my office the following day.

Despite several phone calls the next day, in which I confirmed on two separate occasions that my address was in Durban and SAA confirmed both bags were safely in customs in Johannesburg and would be on the next flight to Durban, during the third phone call, I was told that my bag was on its way to Cape Town and that they cannot locate my husbands bag. Yet two hours earlier, I had confirmed the address and SAA had confirmed both bags were in Johannesburg. SAA then explained they could not initiate the track and trace process for my husband's missing bag until 7 days had passed. This makes no sense when SAA has confirmed that they themselves cannot locate my husband's bag.

The worst part of this experience is the attitude of the Sales Desk at Johannesburg International Airport. When the ground staff informed us at Johannesburg Airport that the bags were still in Sao Paulo, they advised that there were available seats on the earlier flight to Durban, and that we should speak to their ticket department about moving our domestic flight earlier due to the inconvenience of losing our bags. The staff member and her supervisor at the ticket sales desk were probably the rudest people we have come across at SAA. They both refused to make eye contact with us when we explained our situation and wanted us to buy a new ticket (despite the later flight we had tickets for being more expensive than the earlier flight). The supervisor rudely told us that if we had an issue we should call the customer complaints hotline, and that they would contact her and she would still not put us onto an earlier flight as it was against SAA's policy.

After giving up and swearing never to use SAA again, we walked to the check in counter where we chatted to the staff there. Well can you believe that they took 30 seconds to listen to us, informed us there was a plane leaving in 20 minutes, called the employee at the gate to check if there were remaining seats, printed our new tickets and told us to run to catch the flight (at NO extra cost). Instead of the staff at the ticket desk arguing for 20 minutes about paying for a flight in 2 hours time, they could have provided great customer service in finding a solution and given us more than enough time to catch an earlier flight instead of again having to run through security to catch a flight.

All in all, very mixed feelings about SAA. Their ground staff need to be properly trained on how to handle customers, though to be fair, the staff at the check in counter were great. As South Africans, we were rather embarrassed with the calibre of people representing our national airlines to visitors, especially when things went wrong. As for the mystery of the missing bags, we will have to see if we ever get them back!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McTravellers2011,McTravellers2011 wrote a review Jan 2019,McTravellers2011,"Umdloti, South Africa",15 contributions,6 helpful votes,Buenos Aires - Durban,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r645135836-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Friendly staff on the plane, rude ground staff, lost luggage.",Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Was flying from Seattle to Gaborone using SAA. Checked in 4 bags of excess luggage from Seattle on the Jet Blue airline. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Got to New York and had to get a boarding pass for the remaining leg of my travel. South African Airways staff at the ticketing/checking in counter in New York was horrible. My carry on was over the limit by 1.1kg and for some reason this woman thought that was a license for her to eyeball me and give me the most stinking attitude.

"Made a booking with SAA about 6 months ago for a return flight from Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. 10 days ago I realized that I wouldn’t have enough time to catch the outbound flight since I will be arriving in Johannesburg on an international flight from London only an hour and a half before. Changing the outbound flight to a later one that day turned out to be an absolute nightmare. Contacted SAA via E-mail and Facebook to see what my options are and how to change this flight, both recommended for me to call their call centre. I replied saying that it is very difficult for me to call them since I am currently on a trip in South America and asked if someone could please solve this via e-mail. Finally someone responded saying that if I didn’t change this flight beforehand I would lose the inbound flight as well. By now, changing only the outbound flight, is more expensive than booking an entirely new one!!!!! Booking a new one would mean however that I’d lose the originally booked return flight. So I decided to change it online and pay the difference which is now already half the price of the original ticket, then however the website tells me that it is not possible to change this flight online and that I have to contact their call centre. I have spent the past two hours trying to call their offices in Brazil, Chile and Argentina with no reply. Finally I found a telephone booth from where I could call to South Africa and spent 8min on the phone explaining what had happened, with absolute no care or acknowledgement from the agent of the trouble I had gone through to change this flight. I am extremely disappointed with SAAs customer service; I have not only wasted money, but also over a week of my time trying to change a flight, which should be something very simple. Don't put on your website that customers can change flights online when this is clearly not the case!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509alinaf,Alina F wrote a review Jan 2019,Alina F,,5 contributions,5 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Bloemfontein,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r644363421-South_African_Airways-World.html,Changing a flight = nightmare,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is a continuation of the review - “Friends don't let friends flySAA.""

A Customer Service representative responded (Dec 6) saying South African Airways is customer centric organisation and assured me that my concerns were being attended to. As a goodwill measure for my inconvienence SSA offered offered 10 000 bonus miles in a Voyager program (Star Alliance membership required).

I replied (Dec 10) after having determined that 10,000 miles would do nothing for me. I stated that in order to be of any benefit I would have to fly any of the Star Alliance carriers to build up more miles. Mind you, I am not regularly in South Africa so an SAA Voyager account would be worthless to me. I concluded that this kind of compensation was not a ""goodwill"" compensation for me. I requested financial compensation for the cost of premium seat assignments purchased from Virgin Atlantic Airways which were forfeit as a result of SAA's misrepresented departure/arrival delays.

South African Airways Customer Service has not responded to my Dec 10 notification, nor my Dec 20 or Jan 2 reminder to the company that I remain prepared to consider, and expect a forthcoming financial compensation offer from South African Airways for reasons specified in previous correspondence.

This is a vivid example of Customer Service NEGLECT which permeates through and is endemic within all levels of South African Airways. Let me repeat - “Friends don't let friends flySAA.""",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/9c/87/ef/mark-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markcE6070WI,Mark C wrote a review Jan 2019,Mark C,"Falmouth, Massachusetts",13 contributions,7 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r643242002-South_African_Airways-World.html,SAA Customer Service Atrocious,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

However I need to add , that this was due to bad weather and heavy traffic in Johannesburg, which delayed our departures from Lusaka and Ndola respectively. Service on flight has always been good.

"Never in my life have I had luggage lost on a DIRECT (no layovers) flight. Flight was delayed 3 hours (because of weight issues), and they asked 30 people to give up their seat on the plane. After getting the 30 volunteers, they said “just kidding, you all can get on” and then they finally let us on the plane. When we arrived in DC, we all waited at baggage claim for about 45 minutes until a representative came to let us know that the SAA crew took all our luggage of the plane WITHOUT letting us know.

We then had to stand in a long line to fill out a claim, and when I got home I realized the representative at the kiosk spelled my home address wrong, which was supposed to be used to deliver my luggage.

"We departed from O. R Tambo on SA2970 to Gan in the Maldives at 9pm South African time on the 15 December 2018.  The flight took approximately 6 hours 45 minutes. On board we were served supper and drinks at 10pm.  We had ordered a special meal, but were told that due to the change in flight time, the airline was not able to provide the special meal and we had to be satisfied with a vegetarian meal.  My advice would be to bring your own meal as the plane food is dreadful.  We arrived in Gan at 7:00am local time.  Prior to arrival we were not served any breakfast on board the aircraft.  On our return flight on SA2971, we departed from Gan at 23h50 on an Airbus A330-200.  On entering the plane there was a dreadful mould like smell emanating from the air vents.  This continued throughout the flight.  A light snack and drinks were served an hour into the flight.  We arrived in South Africa at 03h00.  Again no breakfast was served on board the plane.  On both legs of the flight the in-flight entertainment did not work, but luckily I brought a book to read.  This was by far the worst flight I have been on.

"Flying SAA from London Heathrow to Johannesburg return was a wonderful experience. The new Business Class seats and layout on the A330-300 is excellent. Spacious and with all the facilities. It was really the crew that made the overall experience as well since they are friendly, relaxed, caring and helpful.
The shared United lounge at Heathrow Terminal 2 is very good and so was the SAA lounge at Johannesburg Oliver Tambo airport.
I have flown on may airlines business class and Emirates and Qatar are at the top. SAA is also up there now and I would definitely fly with them again.
The only let down was Terminal 2 at Heathrow which is very poor at catering for disabled people and those needing assistance.

"In the last 15 years that I have been flying SAA have seen a noticeable decline in both quality and consistency, For this flight the aircraft was old, the seat 'lumpy', the food unappetising and the service 'varied'. There are still some charming and real characters in the SAA staff who manage to make the airline shine (but also many others who don't)  but this can not gloss over the decades of mismanagement the airline has experienced. On another recent flight I had to clean the seat I was allotted before sitting down (spilt drinks by previous occupant), which was obviously missed by cleaning crew.

I will make sure that I never fly on a SAA A330-300 again, it seems that SAA have forced in a few extra rows of seats by cutting the legroom of economy passengers.

"SAA is lagging in upgrading their fleet, and the age shows in business class on the long-haul from JFK to JNB.  The configuration in business is 2-2-2, with lay-flat seats that lack privacy and are not very comfortable for sleeping.  Service is spotty, and our crew rushed to get everyone fed immediately after takeoff, cleared things quickly, then largely disappeared until roughly 90-minutes before landing. Food was also mediocre, and below par with other major airlines. SAA can do better, and our return trip took us from JNB to Heathrow on their updated, reconfigured business class (1-2-1), which was very good indeed.  Given the airline's financial woes, it's unclear when and if this will occur.

I needed a 2nd for my daughter and eventually the crew roused himself to open a door where there were a whole tray of chilled waters?

"I made my booking on a flight from Johannesburg months in advance. When the time came, I was denied boarding because they were overbooked and they offered to put me on another flight 4hrs later.

I refused, but this time they insisted I couldn't board and said they were authorized to overbook. The inconvenience to me and my plans was not their conce even though I explained it. One other time on the same route,someone else was assigned my seat number. I have lost faith in SAA. Their customer service also leaves a lot to be desired.

"This is a special charter flight arranged for the season, terminating mid January 2019. First we were told that the 7 hour flight had become 8 hours as we were refueling in Mauritius. The flight would now leave just after midnight rather than a 7pm checkin. This was about 2 weeks prior to departure after connecting flights had been booked.

The online check-in did not allow me to choose my seat, so I landed up at the back of the plane although there were several free seats, even rows of 4 that were empty. I immediately noticed the familiar fresh air nozzle above your seat was missing on this plane. Soon it became extremely hot. I noticed all the TV screens in the seat backs were hot to the touch. They must have been on for some time. I would recommend not sitting in the back 1/4 of the plane as the cabin gets noticeably cooler the more you move forward. That leg took about 8.5 hours. The return journey via Dar took closer to 10 hours.
At the back you are also woken by the noise of every passenger requesting service, using the service button. Finally in inflight announcements appear to set for the hard of hearing and the captain's were the worst, blasting you with high volume interference/rasping sounds.

"I cannot complain about the flight and service thereon.

A box with literally 2 or 3 slices of meat, a salad that would not be to everybody's taste and a tiny desert is not a meal I would expect on an international flight at those prices.

Management and Administrative staff/procedures however, deserves a massive toffee on this one: I booked a flight for my wife to join me on my most recent rotation in Namibia on 27th October for a return flight leaving 5th Dec and returning on the 20th. Cost was almost R6,000. Shortly thereafter on the 14th of November, I was forced to cancel and asked for a refund. My refund would be approximately R4,300 but the part I had a problem with is how long it takes to get the refund. I was told that it would take up to 21 business days!

As it was a bit chilly while we sat waiting for departure we covered our legs with a blanket to be told that we couldn't do that as it was a hazard (never have I been told that either). The films were on an ongoing rotation so when we wanted to watch a film it was where ever it was in the loop.My major complaint was how unfriendly, non-smiling and non-attentive the steward crew were (we went to and from Melbourne and both flights had unfriendly crew).

"I was in Portugal and had to get back to DC at sort of short notice and the only flight I could get that would allow me to lie down overnight was from Dakar, Senegal. The TAP flight from Lisbon to Dakar was reasonably terrible and I didn't have too much hope for the rest  The Dakar airport was newish but very confusing.

"First issue - apparently there's some problem with SAA, so we couldn't use the TSA pre-check security lines. Second - I used United miles, so wasn't able to pick a seat, much less pay to upgrade to a seat with more legroom,  I ended up 2nd in in a 4 seater, with my friend in the aisle which would have been hideous had the seat between me and the other aisle seat not been empty. The seats were hard and small and uncomfortable.  Maybe they'd be ok for a short flight, but 14 hours??? And then the entertainment options were dismal - and to add insult to injury, there weren't any outlets to charge ones own devices back where they put us.

OMG.I complained numerous times, SAA never even responded, some of the planes are old and broken. If you have any other option even me, If I have to pay more I will pay it and fly another airline. The food is boring, and they serve all these westernize food which most of the passengers are not used to, so all that food gets dumped, wasted in the collection bin.....it's a sin.......It's a typical airline that's bankrubt and there is no money to even clean it inside,......i wonder how good they service these planes.............is there money for that???????????",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/8d/e1/42/cobus-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C0busC,Cobus C wrote a review Dec 2018,Cobus C,"Lusaka, Zambia",45 contributions,7 helpful votes,Lusaka - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r640199702-South_African_Airways-World.html,SAA has gone so backwards........Disgusting,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have not flown with our local airline outside of Africa as I have felt for years that they have not kept up with the excellent service reputation that the airline used to have but, due to the fact that SAA offered the shortest flight to Peru, I booked with SAA. Coming on the heels of a flight to the USA with Emirates and a flight to China a few years back on Cathay Pacific I was really hoping that I wouldn’t be disappointed but sadly I was. The aircraft is showing its age with technology issues and no USB charging abilities. The seats are really narrow. The inflight entertainment system glitched out on a few monitors and after rebooting the system, my monitor and others passengers monitors were no longer working. Fortunately I had my Kindle and iPad to provide my own entertainment. The refreshments offered are meals and accompanying beverages only and you have to go to the back and ask for anything else as the call buttons either are not working or being ignored. By the time I finally went to the back I was told the chocolates were finished. One of the stewardesses was not as slim as most are and she kept bumping passengers as she made her way up and down. On the plus side, the flight itself was smooth and faster than other airlines that go via Europe on the outbound flight with a 2 hour layover in São Paulo. The return flight however, has a 12 hour lay over. Thank goodness I have access to a private lounge! Would l fly SAA again? Highly unlikely. They just do not provide comparative service and would do well to send their cabin crew on Emirates flights to see how it should be done.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/b1/42/4b/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheronA_12,Cherondie wrote a review Dec 2018,Cherondie,"Mokopane, South Africa",112 contributions,61 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Lima,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r640198365-South_African_Airways-World.html,Disappointing customer service,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from Heathrow to Johannesburg and back in the aft cabin of an SAA A330-300. I have never experienced such restricted legroom on a long-haul flight. Even our domestic flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg on an A340-300 had at least four inches more. Further, this was a night flight which drove a lot of people (but not us on principle) to recline their seats. This means that my knees are rammed into the seatback in front and there is a gap of less than six inches between the seat back and the fixed aisle armrest. Squeezing my 18 stone frame through that with weak knees was a nightmare.

We paid £80 extra to choose seats . The flights weren't full and people were moving around the cabin to get better seats than we'd bought. A total waste of money. I also found the E-Bay style auctions for business class upgrades totally bizarre.

"We have literally not even taken off yet and I am writing this review - and I can guarantee I’ll be ready to write another one when we touch down.

I am regretting this decision to fly SAA already. Never again, though sadly I have a feeling I’ll never be returning to my homeland of SA ever again following the ANC’s decision today to write land grabbing into the constitution.

Only positive: this is one of the only direct routes from Australia to South Africa

The rest:
Outdated planes - entertainment is pathetic. You have your own screen but a selection of a whopping *sarcasm* 4 channels are unable to stop/start entertainment, it just runs continuously from some main system. How 90’s is that!?

Push back was already 35 minutes late (scheduled departure at 23:45) as we finally pushed back from the gate the engines cut and an announcement made that something to do with the ‘reverser needing to be unlocked’ wasn’t working so we would have to go back to the gate and have a technician look at it, which may take 30 minutes - we are already at the 20 minute mark and there are still number ours technicians running around with flashlights tinkering is with right engine - which is not a pleasant thing to look at or think about.
I know for a fact this plane has been sitting around at Perth airport all day today - why were these checks and tests not conducted earlier today!?

There are numerous kids on this flight already overtired and agitated.

An air steward repeatedly announcing that passengers need to use the toilets in ‘their class’ and that premium toilets are for ‘exclusive use’ for premium passengers... which is all obviously fine, just ironic considering this day and age’s sensitivity to ‘class’ and the fact we’re travelling to South Africa where ‘class’ is a concept you get murdered over.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyfionna,christyfionnaa wrote a review Dec 2018,christyfionnaa,sydney,20 contributions,5 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r638609418-South_African_Airways-World.html,SAA going downhill as is the whole country,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bought through Expedia a South African Airways flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. It was operated by their Low Cost carrier Mango. Double checked the booking to be sure it included free baggage allowance. Check in was smooth, no problems with the free checked bag. Flight took off on time. Inflight, the aircraft seats were clean. And we were allowed a free meal - we just had to show the crew our boarding pass (it must have indicated something) then they let us select from the menu anything worth up to ZAR70 - this got us a sandwich and a packet of nuts and a drink! The landing was smooth, our baggage came out pretty fast, it was overall a good experience.

"LETTER SENT TO SAA
RE: DaicyDemas@flysaa.com, AnnetteWolhuter@flysaa.com
Dear SAA Manager(s),
My wife and I had an unfortunate experience flying SAA Wednesday November 28 (SA362 CPT-JNB).
THE EVENT
As managers you are certain to be aware that the inbound flight to CPT was a delayed departure from JNB on the date specified. While on our flight outbound (delayed 1 hr +6 min), the captain explained on the public announcement system that the delay was due to the aircraft experiencing a FOD (foreign object debris) event earlier in the day which required the replacement/repair of an the engine. He added that the flight crew had been “playing catch-up” all day. It’s therefore reasonable to expect SAA flight managers were fully knowledgeable of the compounding delay impact well before the SA362 flight crew announcement to passengers.
Regardless of the delay flight SA362 was to absorb, gate representatives of your airline assured my wife and I, as well as other connecting customers, that JNB flight connections would be held for connecting customers. This was confirmed by all customers negatively impacted customers at the International Transfer desk in JNB. As you are surely aware, the International Transfer desk is where the unfortunate waylaid customers receive vouchers for unanticipated accommodations and for further ticketing of alternative outbound flights.
After speaking with SAA representatives at the International Transfer desk, my wife and I were given hotel accommodations, food vouchers for the night/morning and a piece of paper that we were to present to a British Airlines representative at the International Transfer desk the following morning to secure boarding passes for the morning flight BA50 (JNB-LHR).
We arrived at the International Transfer desk at 5:05 AM (BA50 scheduled departure time - 8:40 AM) thereby allowing the required 3 hour international check-in time. Unfortunately there was no British Airline attendant present. We communicated this to the SAA representative and she allegedly tried to call British Airline. She informed us, after 10 minutes hidden from the counter that she was unsuccessful. We receiving no further assistance nor any situational advise from the SAA staff. We decided to race to the BA ticket counter in the main terminal to present our piece of paper received from SAA the night before, to obtain boarding passes for Flight BA50. We arrived at the BA check-in counter 5 minutes after the gate was closed (7:45 AM).
The British Airline representative informed us that we were required to have boarding passes 1 hour before departure. We explained that we attempted to obtain boarding passes at the International Transfer desk as instructed by SAA at the International Transfer desk the night before. We explained that a British Airline representative was not there. We were then informed that the only time a BA representative would be scheduled at the International Transfer desk would be in the event another air carrier communicated and coordinated an international customer’s need for a re-booking on a BA flight.
We then returned to the International Transfer desk where we were instructed go to the SAA Ticket Sales desk back in the main terminal. Upon our return, we were offered only a SAA flight to LHR. After 1 hour we were issued boarding passes for the SAA flight from JNB-LHR and instructed to retrieve our own luggage from BINAIR, and that we were responsible for re-checking them onto the JNB-LHR re-assigned SAA flight. We also received meal and day-hotel vouchers from SAA Ticket Sales representatives.
I retrieved our luggage from BINAIR after a 4 hour wait for BINAIR personnel to find our luggage in the airport baggage storage basement. This confirms that it’s reasonable to believe SAA had NO INTENTION to transfer our luggage to the morning BA50 flight.
While at the hotel, browsing the internet, I found our originally planned Virgin Atlantic Airline flight (the day before) was scheduled to depart only 5 minutes after the scheduled SAA departure from JNB-LHR. I was never told of this at the SAA Ticket Sales desk, nor were we offered this option for ticketing re-assignment.
Fully understanding this situation, I explained to the SAA representative at the Ticket Sales desk later that afternoon that we had paid for ‘premium economy” seats on Virgin Atlantic from JNB-LHR. We requested from the SAA representative at the Ticket Sales desk to re-book us on the Virgin Atlantic flight to LHR. Mind you, we had already checked with Virgin Atlantic regarding availability of the flight scheduled to depart 5 minutes after our assigned SAA flight. The BA representative (on the opposite side of the main terminal) informed us that the flight was wide open! Yet, after informing the SAA representative of the BA availability, SAA refused to accommodate our request due to (ask explained by the attending representative) the extreme inconvenience and extra work such a modification would require! Furthermore, even though the cascading effect of the SAA delay was not our (the customer’s) fault, absolutely no compensation was offered for the Virgin Atlantic ‘premium economy’ costs.
CUTTING TO THE QUICK
The unfortunate fact is that CPT South Africa Airline gate personnel were either misinformed by supervisors/managers or knowingly misrepresented information to JNB connecting customers that had connecting flights. It’s quite clear as an industry practice that air carriers not part of the SAA “alliance of carriers” have no obligation to delay scheduled departures for delayed connecting customers from another carrier. Yet, SAA totally misrepresented this fact likely knowing full well our connecting Virgin Atlantic flight to LHR would not delay for us.
Once at JNB, my wife and I, were assured at the International Transfer desk passage a BA flight the following morning. It’s suspect that SAA representatives even made an attempt to make necessary coordination/communication given the British Airlines representative response the following morning.
The proof is clear that SAA had no intention to ticket us aboard the BA50 flight since our luggage took 4 hours to retrieve from the bowels of the airport storage by your contract baggage carrier (BINAIR).
The denied request for re-booking from SAA to Virgin Atlantic (originally scheduled the day before - & on this particular day having known availability) becomes an obvious “POUCHING” maneuver by SAA. Then there is the issue involving the refusal of financial compensation for the cost of premium economy class seating on our originally scheduled flight with Virgin Atlantic.
The practice of LIES & DECEPTIONS demonstrated by South Africa Airline during this unfortunate experience thrust upon numerous connecting customers seems representative of a company-wide standard operating procedure that permeates from top management down.

NEXT STEP
I was employed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for 34 years. I’m well acquainted with air traffic, airport operations and various authorities that would have a keen interested of the sub-standard professional practices of your airline. If SAA wishes to avoid further duress beyond a mere customer’s complaint, I will entertain any mitigation efforts.
Happy Holidays,
Mark J. Cool

"I've been reading the reviews for the last 9 months of this airline because I booked a tour package and this was the airline they use. Based on reviews on Trip Advisor I was dreading it. To my surprise, it was actually very good.

Flew economy from JFK to Johannesburg. Flight was on time. Gate agents were friendly. I made a $1500 bid to upgrade to first class but was rejected even though there were empty seats.

I see complaints about seat quality, but what economy seat for 15 hours is going to be comfortable? Good leg room. No power source.

My monitor worked through out, however it's old and dated. Grainy and older movies. Knowing the monitors didn't always work based on reviews, I loaded up my phone with movies and brought a power brick charger. I just ended up watching my phone's movies. The woman in front of me didn't have a working monitor. Be prepared and plan ahead.

Flight was smooth until we reached Africa, then it was a little bumpy. Service was ok. I'm not looking for a whole bunch when I travel. Attendant did make a small snide comment about my luggage storage when we were getting ready to land, but I'm going to let that pass, as for the the whole flight they were efficient in their jobs.

Breakfast was tasty but the vegetarian dinner was not. It's an airline so I don't expect much.

From JHB to Cape Town I was upgraded to First Class with SAA's step up program for $70. Much nicer. I laid the seat down and slept for two hours. Service was better but I slept through the meal they provided.

Coming back to JFK my bid of $1500 was accepted and I flew first class. Much nicer seat, better service, better food. However, the pilot warned us it would be bumpy when we took off. Smooth for 90 min then bumpy for the rest of the trip. Nothing terrifying, but enough were I couldn't sleep. So I really couldn't enjoy the lay flat bed. Monitors did go out for a bit on take off and they had to reboot the system, so I just went to the phone again for entertainment.

The Premier lounges in Cape Town and Johannesburg were both great.

Bottom line is this: the flight is long both ways. Get yourself mentally prepared for that. Bring back up entertainment. Try to bid up if you can afford it. They got me from NY to Africa and back safely and on time. That's what counts the most.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/23/2b/79/bill-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M608JAbillc,Bill C wrote a review Nov 2018,Bill C,"Los Angeles, California",49 contributions,31 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r636512720-South_African_Airways-World.html,Not a Bad Experince,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew to Cape Town in November, the checking in simple and boarding the plane was efficiently done. Flight took off on time. The seat were reasonably comfortable. The inflight entertainment was slightly limited but there were 3 movies I hadn't seen , so sorted. The flight attendant were ok . Not many smiles though. Dinner served was edible as was the breakfast.
Only thing we didn't like was the flight stopped at joburg, where we had to collect our luggage, go thru passport control and then check in again for Cape Town flight and go thru security again . It took almost two hrs from the moment the plane landed to be at our next gate.
I don't know why our luggage wasn't transferred directly onto the next flight as it was on return flight. I would fly again with SAA

I have a business interest in South Africa that causes me to make the trip from the U.S. at least three times a year.  I choose to fly on SAA out of Washington Dulles.   The other options are SAA through JFK (Just an awful experience) or Delta out of Atlanta.  I will only fly Delta as a last resort.  It is too expensive even though a shorter flight length because it is non-stop to Joburg while SAA stops in either Dakar or Accra.  Delta tried to garner favor with the liberals by irrationally announcing that they will no longer fly African hunting trophies back to the US.  Pretty lame!  They refuse to understand that African hunting safaris are the prime revenue source for conservation and anti-poaching efforts.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/7f/avatar066.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhV2343GA,davidhV2343GA wrote a review Nov 2018,davidhV2343GA,"Westlake, Ohio",38 contributions,9 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Washington DC,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r636365195-South_African_Airways-World.html,U.S./ South Africa Connection,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The direct Flight from JNB to JFK is the most practical and quickest way to travel from Johannesburg to New York, the flight is quite pleasant and does not feel as long as it may sound (15 hours), its feels like a little bit longer night than usual. You leave Johannesburg at 9pm local time and land in NY at 7am (local time) the following morning.
The SAA cabin is a bit dated on our return flight, I had problems with my in flight entertainment, no sound and touch screed did not work. There is no USB charging stations, in most if not all competitors doing such long range flights this is provided as standard. This is a big negative SAA can do better.
The food and beverages was std and comparable to most competitors, cabin crew friendly and helpful.

"It took me 7 years to convince my mother to come for a visit here in Melbourne, she is not keen on flying, and made it clear that should she come, she will only travel on Qantas and not on SAA, so after 7 years of begging her to come, she agreed. We then booked her ticket on Qantas to travel from Cape Town to Melbourne, and she was very happy, but since Qantas does not fly to or from Cape Town, that part of the flight would have to be on another partner airline, which turned out to be SAA.
So, yesterday afternoon my mother departed from Cape Town, nervous but excited, so all seemed to be well, however this morning around 4am I got a call from a very distress mother, calling from Jo’burg and informing me the flight from Cape Town to Jo’burg got delayed, and as a result she missed the Qantas flight to Sydney, but SAA offered to put on the next SAA flight via Perth, at first my mother refused, but after some convincing I managed to get her to agree, my mother handed the phone to the SAA lady who informed me of the new flight details, I took the opportunity to ask her if it would be possible to upgrade my mother to business class, but the lady told me they can’t, since now they are already supplying my mother with a replacement ticket at their cost. We agreed and the SAA lady proceded to book the flight to then realize that my mother’s suitcase was left behind in Cape Town, so not on the flight with my mother, as you can now imagine, my mother was now very anxious, distressed and upset, she will now arrive in Melbourne without her luggage, and not knowing when if and at all it will arrive. I will probably have to take leave from work tomorrow to take my mother to the shops to go and buy some clothes and basics she might need, I am sure SAA will not compensate me for my lost income.

All I can say is, if you are thinking of flying to SA, dont use SAA !, and if you fly with Qantas to Cape Town, insist the book you on British Air (Comair), spare yourself the hassle and stress related with flying SAA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/d2/90/69/summie-summie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summie-Summie,Summie wrote a review Nov 2018,Summie,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",9 contributions,3 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Melbourne,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r635507472-South_African_Airways-World.html,"BE Warned anybody thinking of travelling to South Africa on SAA, think TWICE-the wheels are for sure coming of !!!!",Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was a return journey LHR-JNB-HLE-JNB-LHR. It was booked as a through ticket with South African Airlines, though the JNB-HLE leg is run by the 'wholly owned subsidiary' SA Airlink. There is one flight scheduled each weak, on a Saturday. It turns out 'scheduled' is a rather fictional term. Because they have a monopoly, it is a very expensive flight.
St Helena airport has been described as 'the world's most useless airport', and, despite lovely character of the island, and the friendliness of its residents, this statement is sadly true. If you actually get here on the outbound leg, you seem to have very little chance of getting back again. What are called weather delays are frequent, leading to cancellation. While the weather may be the case at the point of cancellation, further attempts to make the flight then happen at 3-4 day intervals if you are lucky, and this time separation is not due to weather, it is due apparently to the fact that Airlink have very few pilots (4, possibly 5) who are capable of landing here, and not enough planes to schedule a flight as they are occupied elsewhere. Thus, after 3 days, another flight was scheduled, but it was cancelled while en route as well. I am still here, with another attempt scheduled 3 days later.
What they then don't tell you is that when you have an onward connection , because it is a 'weather' delay, they can charge you a hefty 'penalty fee' (c. £400 to London) for the privilege of re-arranging the longhaul flight that their own failure has led you to miss. This is even the case if that filght is with South African on a through booking. If you are with another airline then you will have to buy an entirely new ticket most likely, and if you need to travel urgently (as you are already a week late) this could cost you over £1000. If your rearranged flight from St Helena is itself cancelled, as happened this week, you may then get hit with yet another penatly fee, and in principle it seems this could happen again and again, as admitted by the agents here. Given this, how you are meant to be able to secure a confirmed long haul return booking without hundreds and potentially thousands of pounds in costs is unclear to say the least.
Airlink use an agent called Solomons in Jamestown, and even if you have booked with SAA or your own agent, you will hear nothing from them, even when they have your e-mail and phone as part of the booking, as Solomons seem to think they have the right to take over everything. SAA will not respond to e-mails either (phone reception is almost non existent and v expensive on St Helena), and if you can manage to get into their website (limited web access too!) to confirm, check in, etc, no mention is made of this payment, and nothing you can do reveals it, even though the site says you have a confirmed ticket and no outstanding payments. Requests to their agent or to Airlink directly for a printed/e-mailed invoice stating and explaining the cost are met with blank stares. Despite the size of the bill, credit card use is almost non-existent on St Helena - you can pay by faxing a long form to S Africa and hoping, and may also be asked to send photos of both sides of your credit card - in the UK this request would be illegal, and obeying it would void all your rights to credit fraud cover from your bank!! In short, in a week of delay and despite multiple requests, SAA or Airlink have failed to contact me, other than sending one generic e-mail telling me the details of the first re-arranged flight, AFTER that flight had itself been cancelled!! Having cancelled their flights, their website is not updated until several days after, which then means even if you can speak to your airline (including SAA itself) about re-arranging your long haul flight, they will say they can do nothing until they can see that the flight has actually been cancelled.
In short, Airlink, and their relationship with their parent SAA, is a complete and utter dogs dinner, and their 'service' is non-existent. It is perhaps no wonder that it seems to be strongly rumoured that SAA is close to going under. What they are doing appears to be on the borderline of, if not actually, fraudulent
All this is a great shame for St Helena, as the island is beautiful, very friendly and has a lot to offer the more adventurous traveller. However there is no point even thinking you might come here unless you have a 1-2 week buffer after your planned return to take account of the high risk of getting stuck here..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/8b/59/86/polarbug.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polarbug,polarbug wrote a review Nov 2018,polarbug,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",177 contributions,110 helpful votes,"St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha - Johannesburg",Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r635076949-South_African_Airways-World.html,Do not attempt this journey unless you have days or weeks available to be delayed,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We booked our flight to Mauritius with South African Airways. The flight is operated by Air Mauritius. CHECKED in with a South African Airways lady who didn't even acknowlege us. We knew our luggage could be a maximum of 23kg. When she weighed our luggage she said it had to be 20kg because of the air Mauritius plane and stated we would be mad to pay for extra luggage. Upon realising we booked with SAA she said 23kg is ok.  Then sniggered when she said the flight is very full and we can't sit together.

"I took a round-trip international flight from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.  The flight was only one and one half hours.  The time flew by.  The seats were very comfortable.  The seat belt is longer than most other airlines.  There are no in-flight movies, which was a downside, but the flight was short.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  The bathrooms were a bit cramped, but it is a plane.  On the return flight from Zimbabwe, some type of insecticide is sprayed throughout the plane to kill any mosquitoes that may have traveled in your bags.  We were told the odorless spray is harmless to humans.  However, if you where contact lens or have sensitive eyes, you may want to close them during the spraying.

"Our flight from Perth to Johannesburg was uneventful, but we flew at night and our bedding was thrown at our feet in a plastic bag with no help to put it in place. (We were flying Business Class). However it was the return journey that annoyed me.  In the middle of the night I jammed my finger in the toilet door because it had been folded back and was hard to close.  With split skin and blood dripping I went to the two flight attendants nearby who looked at it and offered a band aid - no disinfectant etc.  Later on in the night when the band aid needed changing I approached the head flight attendant requesting a new one, and she said ""I'll search around in my bag and see if I can find one"".

"Had booked the vacation of a lifetime on #FlySAA @FlySAA for me and my family to South Africa and Ghana.  My family bought some very expensive business class tickets on SAA for travel this December.  Very soon after the purchase I got diagnosed w a brain tumor,  had brain surgery and was ordered not to travel.  South African Airways literally told my husband and me, over the phone, I ""would have to die for them to refund the cost of the tickets"" - over $22,000. I've provided a letter from my neurosurgeon and made several requests for a refund. They have yet to respond. I need the funds now to pay my medical Bills and I need to focus on recovering and living, not fighting a heartless airline. To add insult to Injury, they said they would charge a $2,000 change fee for me to rebook a future date.

"Seats were very tight for the 14.5 hour flight.  The flight was not full.  However the airline  was seating people together and those that flew alone were getting four seats together while couples and pairs of people were seated in only two seats together.  In fact, my husband and I asked for a row of four together and they would not give it to us.  However, several single persons in front  and behind us were the only ones in the row and were able to spread out over four seats; and we paid the same as them.  In addition, a few of the stewards were nasty.  They only had beer and wine for the long flight.  The food was not good and did not look appetizing.  Not a great experience traveling with South Africa Airline.  And neither the way there or the way home was the flight filled.  They literally could have given everyone two seats if they had planned it out.  Or put larger seats in the plane for such a long flight. My entertainment TV did not work on the way there and my husbands sound did not work on the way back.

"Terminal 2 at Heathrow has no dedicated SAA lounge but there is a choice of four or five affiliated airline lounges. The ones in Departures B, closest to the gate, are Singapore Airlines or Air Canada.
Embarkation was straightforward and cabin crew pleasant and efficient. My request for sparkling water however was met with ""I am afraid we cannot open the bar until after take off"". However a bottle did miraculously appear a couple of minutes later.
The new seating on the A330-300 in business class is 1x2x1 so all seats have direct aisle access, a big plus. The seat itself is roomy and has adequate storage for small items but I put my shoes in the overhead bin. SAA provide a small mattress which provides some support from shoulders to hips, a very nice duvet and a generous pillow for when you turn the seat into a flat bed.
Downside of this seat is the limited adjustment of the backrest when seating.
SAA do not allow passengers to access the IFE until some point after take off when cabin crew decide to switch it on. I found that the choice of entertainment was very limited, nothing like as good as Emirates.
Food comprised of dinner and breakfast. Dinner was surprisingly good but breakfast a disappointment although on the return breakfast was not too bad.
Drinks service was good and cabin crew excellent.

"The A340 has surprising leg room in economy.  We are not tall, but could stretch our legs fully with room to spare.  The seat configuration is 2-4-2, so we find the two seat - window and aisle - the most comfortable.  The seats are rather comfortable.  Comfort is paramount on these 15 + hour non-stop flights.  The flights left on time and arrived on time.  The cabin was kept at a comfortable temperature, and even though both flights were more than 2/3 full, they didn't feel cramped.  I am miserable on long flights because sleep just won't come.  On these flights, I was less miserable than most.  More than half the flight to Johannesburg, and all of the flight to JFK, were in the dark.The cabin service is where SAA falls down big time.  About an hour after takeoff, they served the evening meal - nothing spectacular - but edible.  Then, nothing until about two hours before landing when they served another passable meal.  For the ten hours in between meal services, I think the cabin crew got off the airplane and went to a party.  Maybe a max of two crew members were anywhere around.  To their credit, there was always bottled water, apple juice, and light snacks on the counter in the galleys.  For those lucky souls that can sleep, it made no difference.  The other downside was the somber nature of the cabin crew.  I think they trained with some of our domestic airline crews. In flight entertainment is okay - games, movies, and a moving map that is discouraging to watch,  Suggestions:  If you fly economy, and want to go non-stop to South Africa, this is a good choice.  Take some snacks, a good book, I tunes, or something to pass the time.  I recommend compression stockings.  They really help with long sits.  Get up and move about.  The aircraft has two aisles so you can make a circuit.  Be courteous to the people ahead of you - don't kick the seat, or bounce stuff on the tray table.  When you recline, do just one notch so you don't compress the passenger behind you.  South African customs/immigration is a snap.  When you get back to JFK, be prepared to walk a long ways to get to customs.  Go to the bathroom on the plane before you land.  I think JFK is the pits, but you're stuck with it if you use this flight.Enjoy!

"My experience with SAA in my travels over the years has been a positive one. The service of the staff from ground staff to the cabin crew is always pleasant. I especially appreciate the airline advising passengers via sms of any delays relating to their flights. This feature came in handy once when I was running late for my flight back to O.R. Tambo.

"I was a bit concerned about other bad reviews on SAA flights, but I've got a nice surprise.
This flight was the first of two long-haul flights from Australia to Brazil. Travelling with my baby daughter (7 months old) and wife, heavely packaged, I couldn't book basinet seats prior to check-in. SAA online website and call centers are not helpful.
In the ground, SAA crew was very helpful and attentive to us. They have pre-selected a basinet seat. Actually they have locked the 4 middle seats to the 3 of us, which made our flight extremely more confortable. Luck was in place. It was possible due to a not fully booked flight.

The A340-600 is already already tired. Old seats and entertainment, but does the job. The food was more on the OK side, nothing great, nothing too bad. Water bottles available on demand was also great.

It was a nice flight and a surprise to not having a scary flight as many other reviews pointed out.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thiagofrs,Thiagofrs wrote a review Oct 2018,Thiagofrs,"Dianella, Australia",31 contributions,12 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r627818226-South_African_Airways-World.html,Nice flight and great crew,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We asked the ticket counter lady if our pre-booked seats were the exit rows that we bought prior to our flight & she assured us that they were exit seats.

She told us we could notify the airline to see about a refund of the price paid for the exit seats.  However, one of the flight crew actually went & checked and secured for us the exit row seats that we were expecting (they were open seats).  The airline had actually changed the plane type for our flight so that was the reason for us losing our exit row seats. Kuddos to that airline crew member.  The crew on this flight was excellent!

"I have flown with many airlines and currently hold gold membership with three large popular ones; just to give you an idea of how much time I spend in the air. For interest sake SAA isn't one of these. I have flown internationally with SAA business and economy class about 20 times now, and its fair to say if you rate Singapore Airlines a 5 out of 5 for service then I would peg SAA at a 4. Their service is prompt and friendly. They don't leave the meal trays in front of you for ages like QANTAS. They are quick to hand out food and drinks and again to clean it all away so you can get some sleep. Their staff are professional, friendly and service oriented. You don't see them standing around having a chat to each other. They are either serving or walking the corridor to be of service.

"Flew home from Safari via SAA from Port Elizabeth to JFK; flew from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth on September 30, 2018 and SAA lost our luggage, delivering it more than two days later with no excuse or explanation.  As of today, claim for delayed baggage (we needed clothes and hat for safari) unanswered but passed from one office to another denying it was the correct office.  Called several times, got people to promise return calls, but of course, no return calls.  After 16 days, FINALLY got an email essentially asking me to start all over.On October 4, on flight 0203, a total disaster.  First, moved departure gate at last minute resulting in significant delay, so missed connection at JFK.  Went through additional security (all passengers) TWICE, with no explanation for the duplication.  On board, ac broken, but apparently heater worked fine.

The flight attendant at the beginning of the flight talked about Mr Mandela and respect. Steward Dane Boyson has none. Very dissatisfied with the service. Also my in flight tv was not working and they did nothing to assist. I’ll fly Delta next trip!

"As we all know seat space is minimal. I am only 5'3"" and my knees were close enough to the seat in front of me that I had to twist and turn like a contortionist to cross my legs. You will also definitely know your neighbor much better after the flight because seats seemed to be very narrow. I heard tall and large people had problems. Aisle seemed very narrow, also. It was about a 17 hour flight so they did give us compression socks, eye covers and toothbrush/paste. They give you a lot of food during your meal. It was just ok. You get a main dish, crackers/cheese, roll/butter, salad or fruit and a dessert. We stopped to gas up in Ghana and we're not allowed off of the plane or in the aisles. They came on and cleaned during that hour. Also, they walk up the aisle and hold this canister which sprayed something into the air. It went straight up not at us. Not really sure what that was. One thing I wish is that the seats have a little more cushioning. Our butts were extremely sore. All in all it isn't a fun trip because of the length.

"We'd booked for our Namibian holiday about 12 months' previously.  When we arrived at the check-in counter two hours before the flight, we were told that they were very sorry but SAA had overbooked and 8 passengers would not be going on that flight.  We were two of them.  The young man whose job it was to deliver this news was very kind and polite and helped us phone to cancel that night's accommodation in Namibia, and took us to the branch office of our car hire place to sort that out.  He also gave us two vouchers for R3000 (AUD$300) to be used on a regional flight within a year, not transferrable, and probably completely useless to us, and a magnificent R70 each (AUD$7) for food and drink for the 12 hours until we could get on a plane.  To be fair, we have flown on SAA many times and this has never happened to us before.  The fact that we had flown with them many times and were members of their Voyager Club should probably have given us some sort of precedence, but perhaps they don't consider loyalty important.So, a warning to all those who think that because their ticket says 'confirmed', it's only the ticket that's confirmed, not the seat on the plane.  In all other respects, SAA has been quite reliable and on time, but when this happens at the beginning of a holiday, it leaves a bad impression.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraw555,Barbara W wrote a review Oct 2018,Barbara W,"Brisbane, Australia",19 contributions,14 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Windhoek,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r623651181-South_African_Airways-World.html,Dumped,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flying South African airways started off as a pleasant experience. The airplane for the international leg of the journey looked new and clean. The air conditioning and cabin pressure felt very appropriate and natural.

The entertainment system was modern with good options. I like the fact that they had few fairly recent and good quality Nollywood movies. There's room for increasing the number of movies though.

The airplane used for second leg from Joburg to Cape Town wasn't so new and had a central entertainment system with just one movie showing. But hey, it was just for 2 hours...

The food served was the usual airline food. Not the best, but fills the stomach.

On my arrival in Joburg, there were arrows and instructions leading local transfers to go get their bags and re-checkin their luggage. On getting my luggage, the cover had disappeared and my luggage had a bit of scratch.

On my return journey, no such instructions or arrows were available. I confirmed from the airport staff at OR Tambo if I had to fetch my luggage and re-checkin; they checked my tickets and said there was no need. But lo and behold, my luggage didn't follow me to Nigeria. When it was tracked, it turned out it was still at OR Tambo. This got me really angry. I got back the luggage after 2 days....The lock had been tampered with and the luggage now looked ugly with scratches and dents.

The eventuality of my return journey sort of destroyed the earlier good impressions which the airline had given me.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/d3/16/b6/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammylex,Sam O wrote a review Oct 2018,Sam O,"Ilorin, Nigeria",135 contributions,78 helpful votes,Lagos - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r623029272-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Great Flight experience, but luggage cover disappeared + Luggage not automatically rechecked in for local transfers",,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First of all, we found the cabin crew great on all 3 flights to Jo'burg via Victoria Falls, keen & wiiling with beaming smiles. Unfortunately, the food was uniformly poor on all 3 and the standard of the aircraft was as bad. Our long-haul from Perth to Jo'burg had no entertainment whatsoever as the system had broken down - not bad for an 11-hour flight. The flight to Vic Falls was uneventful but the return from Kasane started an hour late because of a faulty aircon fan and was then grounded because of the fan & replaced by a substitute plane 5 hours later.

"Saa airlink are the worst to fly with and their service is terrible. My fiance and I had just got married and we were going on honeymoon to the victoria falls via bulawayo, we go to the gate just one and a half minutes after the bus had left the gate to go to the plane. We had checked in on time and were having a meal and got to the gate by 11.23 and the bus had left at 11.21. Our flight was only scheduled to leave at 11.45 so we werent even late for our flight and the lady at the gate did not want to help us whatsoever, she just kept saying 'youre too late and your ticket is forefeited and theres noting i can do about'. We asked her to call another bus or we could jump on another bus going nearby our plane or another car going to the plane and the lady did not want to even try or attempt to help us. When we went to the airlink office to complain about this the lady said if the other lady by the gate wanted to help she could have, she could have requested another bus or vehicle to take us to the plane as we were not late for the flight.
She spoiled our honeymoon and felt no remorse, I will NEVER use saa or airlink ever again and I will make sure all my family and friends know of this.

The planes compared to other airlines are very old. Staff are shocking. In flight they are in scruffy fleece tops. They are not keen to serve. Offer one round of drinks dinner and then if you want anything you have to go to the galley where you are greeted by rude staff. Smiling is not something they do. I’m sure they leave the seatbelt light on all night so they cannot serve hot drinks. Breakfast comes without juice or water. Coffee is only served after breakfast. SAA should be considered a low cost airline because they are certainly no frills. They do not charge a low cost fee.

"I must admit; I was very apprehensive about flying SAA across the Atlantic... However, my flight turned out to be one of the most enjoyable flights in years!

It all started in the airport where I had a great meal in the FNB Slow Lounge. Not the airline's lounge, but if you can get in. It is really good with fresh food.

Note that this flight is on the A330-300 which is MUCH better than the A330-200 that SAA operates.

As I boarded the aircraft, I was welcomed by the air hostess. She took my jacket and offered to hang it up for me. Smiles all the way.

The new seats a superb! Everyone has isle access due to the 1-2-1 configuration, so no bothering the person next to you. Each seat is designed like a cubicle which offers greater privacy than your standard seat. There is also plenty of space next to the seat on the arm rest where you can store your belongings. The seats include good space on the side where you can keep your shoes and other goods. The screens are big and have both a remote and a touch-screen options and the seat is a complete lie-flat seat.

The service on the flight was possibly some of the best that I have experienced as an adult. The cabin controller made one feel that there was nothing that you could not have. Foor example, the wine selection; I could not decide which wine to have, so the stewardess said ""why decide? Lets do a wine tasting and then you can choose""? So she brought 3 glasses and poured the options that I was considering. From there, I could decide which one I wanted with lunch.

Granted, it was a day flight, I still got a good rest in. The food was good and there was plenty of mineral water (I flew with Emirates in June and they tried to ration me on the water- I drink a lot, but you would expect them to have enough for the few people that do drink a lot of water). I had about 2.5l on the flight.

A note: There was a bit of dirt that was not cleaned under the remote in the arm rest. Small things like that can be quite irritating. And if you are going for a 100% great experience, then 99% would be a fail (Management Theory of 99%)

The pilots were also great! What a smooth landing.

Upon disembarking, the said stewardess thanked every single passenger in the cabin personally and by name! And when I saw many of the reactions, I knew that I was not the only one to have had such a great experience.

Value for money- it was also a super option!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeC7105,Mike C wrote a review Oct 2018,Mike C,,96 contributions,25 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Sao Paulo,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r622032772-South_African_Airways-World.html,One of the best experiences!,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The problem was SAA’s policy of overbooking.
The booking was made and paid for months in advance for a very special occasion.

Suffice to say they could not get onto the flight and were put on a much later flight which went via Madagascar. They arrived in Mauritius late evening.

"Our first disappointment was being told that Premium Economy didn't exist with SAA notwithstanding the fact that this is what we paid for and had written confirmation.  The flight was cancelled after we sat for 4 hours on the tarmac in Johannesburg.  We were initially told that we would be fed a meal before disembarking the aircraft and that there were no accommodations available.  Interestingly enough, we had our meal and then were told that we would be put up in a hotel but needed to report back within 5 hours to see what flight arrangements could be made.  A restful nap we did not have, to say the least.  After checking back in we were offered a letter confirming the overnight flight stop with a 25% discount on our next flight with SAA only and no code shares valid for 12 months.  This is the second time we've been ""stiffed"" by SAA and are not likely to avail ourselves of the offer.  Once on board a newly constituted flight, SA9260, we thought that arrangements would be made by SAA to inform its code share partners that passengers would not make their connecting flights.  Obviously, this was not done because when we arrived in Frankfurt, Lufthansa and Air Canada were surprised to learn of our misfortune and made sure that we were accommodated for the night and rescheduled our return flight to Vancouver.  I'm not sure why SAA is part of the Star Alliance when it does not offer the same levels of seating class and service as its partners.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikekliman49,mikekliman49 wrote a review Sep 2018,mikekliman49,"Vancouver, Canada",5 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Frankfurt,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r620013268-South_African_Airways-World.html,A Nightmare in Johannesburg,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We took this flight booked as a ‘block ‘ book as we were on a tour. We flew Economy and are fellow travelers were all seated together in the last 20 rows of the plane. We wer in a Airbus 330. The flight it’s self was good, and on time. The crew was very attentive to us, meals served were as good as aircraft food can be. Water was offered to us all during the night with one of the crew quietly walking past .
Sleeping on the plane! Well that was not easy to do, the limited amount the seats can recline don’t help, but they could not recline any further due to the small amount of keg room between seats (I’m not tall and I had problems). When the seat in front of you was reclined that was it you felt trapped and very, very difficult to get out. On the isle seat you could lift the the arm rest but sitting on the window, not at all easy.
My recommendation if at all possible is to try up grad when you do a night flight, 11 hours sat in a cramped seat is not easy",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7182ZGcatherinew,Catherine W wrote a review Sep 2018,Catherine W,,1 contribution,,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r619907790-South_African_Airways-World.html,Over night flight to Johannesburg,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"SAA uses the A340 for its over 16 hours nonstop flight from JFK to JNB - I don’t understand why they aren’t using better planes in such long flight - it should be the A380 or at least the 777 as most airliners use.
The return flight was the same but this time scary and very bumpy ( a lot of turbulence) .
The business class is very old fashion , old seats and very crowdy cabin. It isn’t comfortable at all !
The service was good as well as the meals served.
The lounge at JNB was also good.

The staff was very accommodating and made the overnight flight quite comfortable. They were constantly serving us dinner, drinks, and more. Because the flight was an overnight one, we were supplied with blankets, socks, tooth brushes, toothpaste, as well as eye masks....in the economy section!

The aircraft was a new one, with comfortable seats with adequate leg room. It was equipped with very good entertainment options like movies, games, etc. that also made for a comfortable flight.

Because there was a stop in Accra, Ghana, the original flight staff changed. The staff was not as attentive as the original one, but there were no problems and we made it to Johannesburg without incident.

I would definitely recommend South African Airlines to anyone traveling to Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALMtex,ALMtex wrote a review Sep 2018,ALMtex,"Houston, Texas",19 contributions,6 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r618664777-South_African_Airways-World.html,First Flight on South African Airways,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have to admit I was disappointed with SAA. The aeroplane between Heathrow and Johannesburg is fairly new with the cabin nice and clean and some of the nicest economy toilets I’ve seen in a long time.

However the seats are really narrow and the legroom probably the smallest I’ve ever experienced in long haul. It’s so small that even as a size 10 I felt like I was constantly touching the gentleman in the seat next to me which made me feel very uncomfortable. I couldn’t get comfortable at all as the area is so tight. Having taken an overnight flight both ways this really had an impact with the least sleep I’ve had on a flight in ages.

The pros are you still get an amenity pack with eye mask, socks and toothbrush & paste which was good and something you don’t get on a lot of airlines these days.

Although the cabin crew offer plenty of drinks before and during dinner service including bottles of water, which is great, they offer absolutely nothing again until breakfast. Therefore there’s about 7 hours with no access to drinks unless you go to the crew area or press the service button so I was very dehydrated at the end of the flight.

I don’t think I would chose to fly with SAA again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/7e/avatar065.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinelM3107CL,Caroline L wrote a review Sep 2018,Caroline L,"Stamford, United Kingdom",42 contributions,26 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r618651415-South_African_Airways-World.html,Least legroom I have ever experienced long haul ,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It seems the flight was full.  Too full for a stewardess passing through economy to head to business class?  perhaps.    I couldn't tell who is there to help in which class.  Maybe they need uniforms to distinguish who and who is not working in economy.  I only needed help putting my 2 carry ons above since the spaces around my seats (a and c) were already taken by others.   The lady shooed me and said a quick no, no, no.  What does that mean when I am simply trying to keep bags put up? We could have been giving water throughout since it was a 10 hour flight.   they did not walk through the aisles every 2 hours to give water.  One had to go to the back and get it or push that annoying button to ask for water.   If they would just follow the protocol that BA does no one would have to walk to the back or bother to ring a bell.and last but not least,NO LANDING CARDS WERE GIVEN 1 HOUR BEFORE LANDING.  tHIS MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.    there ARE ONLY 4 TABLES INSIDE THE AIRPORT.   if WE HAD BEEN GIVEN THE LANDING CARDS INSIDE, WE WOULD HAVE FILLED THEM OUT PRIOR TO GETTING TO THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT INSIDE THE AIRPORT.    wHO IS IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THIS???

"Due to the fact that this was a code sharing flight with Lufthansa I was not able to book my seat for free more than 23 hours before the flight (something you can do if you fly with SAA). Luckily the flight was rather empty and I had an open seat next to mine – giving me personal space on this long flight. Food on this ten hour flight was of a high quality, especially breakfast: a choice between a warm and continental breakfast.

"Ok the flight was delayed with 14 hours. That can happen. I’m flying business class and than you expect some extra services when delays are happening. Well NOT. Don’t count on this airline. They have no idea what service is. They seem to have organized hotels. But we never got there as nobody and I mean nobody could tell us where to go. We went from travel ticket to check-in to counter and counter. Got send from a to b to c. Did t get the needed hotel name (got 2) no support nothing. Ended up in the wrong hotel. Lucky they had a room so stayed there. But as I noticed already with the flight this airline doesn’t know what service means. AVOID THEM. Not worth looking at when you want to fly. Spend a bit more and fly a descent carrier.

"On a recent flight from JHB to PER there was no air flow in the cabin. For the first few hours we sweltered, but then got cooler as we increased elevation. However there was still no circulating air. When I and others expressed concerns about the lack of air flow attendants said ‘oh there is air’ and other excuses when we could all feel that there wasn’t. People were getting upset and children were crying because they were so hot. The food was also terrible and like what you would expect from the 80’s.

The only advantage to SAA is that it flies direct from Perth to Joburg. Personally I can’t wait until they go out of business and Qantas takes over this route. If I ever have to fly to Joburg again I am seriously considering flying the Qantas Sydney flight - adding 12h onto an already long flight is worth avoiding the dangerous conditions on SAA.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooBoo108,BooBoo108 wrote a review Sep 2018,BooBoo108,Australia,60 contributions,50 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r617973173-South_African_Airways-World.html,"No air, crew gaslighting passengers ",Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I discovered this flight by accident and it turned out to be a gem of a find. Usually, traveling from Accra Ghana to Washington on DC involves a lengthy and cumbersome trip through Europe that risks baggage loss or delays since one must change flights in Europe. The direct flight on South African Airways from Accra to Washington’s Dulles International Airport cut down the travel time and eliminated the need to change flights on the way. Because the flight departs Accra late at night (11.35pm), I slept soundly for most of the trip, especially as there was very little turbulence. The plane was sparkling clean and big and the seats were comfortable . Inflight Service was excellent and food and drinks were plentiful and of high quality. My biggest complaint is the price.

"No air conditioning available on an 11.5 hour flight to Jo’burg from Perth, and the same on the return flight. I can only assume some sort of economising by fuel efficiency. Both the economy cabin and business class were so hot that customers spent all flight complaining to staff. No sleep and wet with perspiration. An extremely uncomfortable flight. I called for the Senior Purser to express my horror at the conditions and she stated that they are having difficulty with this particular type of plane. The A340/360 ? Other flight staff gave different stories. After being assured that the temp had been turned down there was absolutely no change in the cabin temp.
Add to this the loss of my suitcase for over 24 hrs on arriving in Zimbabwe from Perth. With no confidence in the SAA Staff at Zimbabwe Airport I held grave fears I would not see my suitcase for the remainder of the trip.
Also to be notified 60 mins before flight at Perth that there would not be any on screen entertainment available at all and to head back out of the International Terminal to the Newsagency to buy your entertainment for the flight! My husband was horrified.
On return to Perth I advised the one SAA employee of the horrific conditions on the return flight. She replied to me “ It’s not a life or death problem”. I hope nobody had contracted a highly contagious serious disease in Africa on that flight. The environment was rife for spread of all sorts of contagions.

As part of a large social group of frequent travellers in their 50’s, with money and time to travel well,I will be advising them never to set foot on an SAA flight. Returning from Perth to Melb on a Virgin flight was an immense relief, and a pure quality experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/94/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnOCG,Anna OC wrote a review Sep 2018,Anna OC,"Surrey Hills, Australia",2 contributions,2 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r617580474-South_African_Airways-World.html,Lack of confidence re safety and very poor service quality.,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight was delayed from Harare to Johannesburg yet I had a connecting flight to Luanda on the 13th of September 2018. I was assured that I would be given good preference on arrival in Johannesburg for me to be rushed quickly to my connecting flight. However on arrival I had to run like a mad person as SAA did not give me any preference and only to find the gate closed, due to the excessive running, I had an acute asthma attack and had to sort myself out and no assistance from SAA, I then went to their transit desk that booked me in a small uncomfortable hotel at the airport.  I was meant to catch a flight to Luena on the 14th of September at 5am and obviously I missed that as SAA only left Johannesburg at 9am.  I slepl without my bags and was assured thatthsoe bags would be in Luanda on the 14th.  When I got to Luanda, there were no bags.  I failed to have my meeting and I spent 2nights with no changing clothes, lotions, my medication etc which was in my bag. Only got my bags when I decided to check before my departure and ws told they had reached the airport late night of the 15th.  I took them and checked them in to go back to |Harare and on arrival in Harare I didnt have the bags They were missing again. only got a call on the 17th noon that the bags had been found.

"We were on the 16h30 flight from JHB to PLK. The Captain welcomed us on board and mentioned that we will be flying to Polokwane in the North West province. We all know that Polokwane is in Limpopo province. We thought it was a slip of the tongue from the captain. Again when we landed he said welcome to Polokwane in the North West province. This generated a great laugh from all passengers. I hope the SAA give their staff a brief geography lesson as this information could have affected international travellers who would have panicked and thought they were on the wrong flight.

"Having finished out four week vacation in Africa, my wife and I flew from Nairobi to Amsterdam and then from Amsterdam to Seattle. The flight from Nairobi on South African Airways (Business Class) was the worst we have ever experienced. It started with my wife's request for a blanket before takeoff (we both were experiencing colds at the end of our vacation) - the attendant told me to look in the overhead bin and I explained that I had already done that. He left and returned about 5 minutes later, and literally threw two dirty blankets at my wife without a word..... and he rapidly moved on. Shortly after takeoff, my wife attempted to recline her seat .... it would not budge. We requested assistance - the same flight attendant arrived and told her she didn't know how to recline the seat ..... he made an attempt and failed .... he then walked away and did not return. Later in the flight, while serving meals and beverages, we were told that they had run out of food.

"Our flight was due to leave Hoedspruit at 2.30pm.  Reception at our Game Reserve rang SAA at 9.30am to check the flight was still operational (apparently they need to do this on a daily basis as SAA is so unreliable).  Advised everything was in order we left and drove to the airport, checked in and deposited our luggage.  At 2.15pm we were advised the flight was delayed at least 2 hours.  This caused concern as we had a connecting flight to Dubai departing at 7.10pm.  Given that the plane was now not leaving until 4.30pm – plus a 1 hour flight – plus waiting for our luggage to be unloaded – plus getting from the domestic terminal to the international terminal and checking in – we were really worried.  The staff at Hoedspruit advised us Johannesburg were aware of the situation and ground staff would be waiting to assist us.At last we arrived at Johannesburg, were ushered off the plane and onto a bus for the ride to the terminal.  Half the passengers were on the first bus and the other half waited for a second bus.  The second bus arrived and the rest of the passengers boarded and the bus left.  What were we doing? The bus driver was chatting to a friend!  In the end the passengers started to yell at him to stop talking and get us to the terminal – a few passengers actually approached the ground crew and told them to get the bus driver to stop talking and get us to the terminal.We finally arrived at the terminal, retrieved our luggage (at this time I noticed the black strap around my suitcase was missing but as we had to rush to make our connecting flight I didn’t give this much thought).  We literally ran through the airport to the international terminal, checked in, lodged our luggage and arrived at the boarding gate just in time to join the queue to board.  Yes, the gate had opened and boarding had commenced – we were very lucky. Our Emirates flight left Johannesburg on time. When we arrived in Dubai and retrieved our luggage I found the black strap from my suitcase inside the suitcase.

"Our first flight from Cairo was due to depart at 10.50pm on Sunday. Two weeks before our vacation began we were advised this flight had changed from 10.50pm to 10.30am the same day.  This caused problems as we had already booked a day tour in Cairo (non-refundable).  Our options were to take this flight, leave a day earlier or leave a day later.  None of these options were suitable to us – we couldn’t leave a day earlier as we were still on tour in Egypt, we couldn’t leave a day later as our South African Safari started that day, so we were left with no alternative but to accept this change.  Unfortunately, this flight had us arriving in Johannesburg at 6.30pm and our connecting flight didn’t depart until 9.50am the following morning – which meant a 16 hour wait in the airport terminal after an 8 hour flight (as well as the 3 hours at the airport required before check-in) a total of 27 hours on the go!.  Our travel agent contacted the SAA representative and tried to obtain some sort of contribution to an overnight hotel or even a meal voucher.  Advice came back that no contribution would be considered however if we didn’t want to accept this flight SAA would issue a full refund without charging any penalty fees.  Great Customer Service – NOT!We found a hotel near the airport (at our own expense).  The following morning we arrived at Johannesburg Airport – our luggage was unloaded from the Shuttle Bus and a man in a blue uniform and wearing a lanyard around his neck with a sign “Porter” took our bags and asked what airline we were travelling with.  He then took us to the SAA check-in counter.  After checking in he then told us there was a 200 Rand fee for taking our luggage and assisting with the check-in.  Obviously this is a scam however we didn’t know it at the time so we reluctantly paid.  After talking with other people we were told this is a common scam conducted at the airport and even though the airline staff are aware of this, they (or any security personnel) don’t do anything to stop it.  OK, we put this down to a learning experience for us.  Our flight to Hoedspruit was due to depart at 9.50am.  We arrived at the gate at approximately 8.45am.  Looking at the Airline Departure Board we found our flight but the notice next to it said delayed til 10.20 so we went and had a cup of tea.  Watching the Departure Board all the time the notice still said delayed.  After 30 or 40 minutes we went back to the gate to wait.  There was a ground staff member sitting down using her mobile phone (obviously something very important like Facebook or twitter).  Two (2) other families arrived at the gate and we started talking about the delay.  After a while I approached the staff member regarding the delay and was told the plane had departed on time.  She further advised Johannesburg was a ‘silent’ airport with no boarding announcements and that she was screaming (her word) for all passengers to board.To cut a long story short, we were told our luggage had been removed from the plane and we would need to claim it and then re-book another flight.  We would also need to pay for either an upgrade or a new ticket.  When we protested that it wasn’t our fault as the Departure Board still said the flight was delayed we were told we shouldn’t be looking at the Board as the departure time was on our boarding pass. Seriously? We travel extensively so I feel we can speak with considerable knowledge and experience when we say the Departure Board is used to convey information to passengers such as flight delays, change of boarding gates etc.  To have a staff member tell us we shouldn’t be looking at the Departure Board but just our boarding pass is ludicrous! Now, we have re-claimed our luggage, gone to the desk and re-booked the next flight to Hoedspruit, paid a nominal fee (thanks to the gentleman at the ticket counter who was the only staff member to offer any form of courtesy and customer service) we have again checked in and dropped off our luggage and proceeded to the departure gate even though we had a couple of hours to wait.Boarding time arrived and we were told the plane had been delayed 15 minutes, (we didn’t even bother looking at the Departure Board).  Another 20 minutes passed and we were ushered to a waiting bus to take us out to the plane.  On to the 2 buses we crammed (6 seats and 80 passengers) and stood there in the heat (15 metres away from the air-conditioned terminal with plenty of seats) for another 30 minutes.  At last we left – drove to the plane, boarded and flew to Hoedspruit!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G5375TVsuem,Sue M wrote a review Sep 2018,Sue M,"Gold Coast, Australia",500 contributions,174 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Hoedspruit,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r617479221-South_African_Airways-World.html,Rude Incompetent Ground Staff,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I recently flew round trip from Kennedy to Johannesburg on SSA.  The first thing I noticed was the lack of an overhead air vent. I hadn’t realized that the constant air flow made flights much more comfortable.  Without the air the cabin was much warmer and stuffy.   The second thing missing was a charging port.  In this day and age  I would have thought all long haul flights would have charging capability for the passengers. Other than those missing features the flight itself was fine.

The flight was poor...the food was mediocre to say the least. The entertainment was at best below par for an international airline. Very outdated and very few selections that were of any quality. The big kicker for me was that for a flight of this duration the staff didn't do anything to clean the bathrooms/toilets they were dirty about 3 hours into the flight and got worse as the flight went on. Have flown many airlines on different routes around the world and always the crew clean the bathrooms around half way through a flight.

"Was on a recent flight from JFK to JNB and was surprised (and disappointed) to find that there was NO power supply at all in economy class (neither USB nor regular plugs) and no wifi. I was headed to a conference and had planned to finalize my presentation on the plane but my laptop ran out of power. I asked a flight attendant to plug it in (they have plugs in business class, and it wasn't full) but they rejected me. It also meant that my phone was not adequately charged when I landed in JNB so I had difficulties calling an Uber. I'm surprised that this day and age an airline can get away with that.
Additionally: the aircraft was OLD; the seats were very hard. The entertainment systems barely worked -- I assume this is a pattern based on others' reviews and their per-emptive announcement to ""be patient"" with the technological glitches before anyone had access to the system. (Remember: 15-hr flight where you have to use your own tablet/phone cautiously because you cannot charge it.)
The aircraft had also not been properly cleaned -- when I put down my tray table, it was sticky and had crumbs on it and there were crackers between my seat.
The upside: I had an empty seat next to me, so I was able to spread out a bit.

"WORST flight in recent memory. The plane was old and in need of refurbishment. No outlets to charge gadgets, plus no outlets at the gate (where we were penned in for security screening purposes) led to everyone being in a mood most foul. The flight was THREE hours late leaving Joburg so they could try to get the entertainment system working. They even talked about us switching to another plane which would have been a nightmare. Eventually they got the entertainment system mostly working, and off we went - finally. My seatmate had business meetings in Dakar (our connection) and we were so late, he and his colleague nearly cancelled them. They groused that the airline is in bankruptcy (true?) and is the worst. I believe them. Bad as all this was, the worst part was the crew on the first leg. Surly and rude; I've never encountered a crew so dreadful, and I fly a fair amount. The lead in economy class barked at us over the intercom periodically, commanding us to SIT DOWN NOW! and other charming, customer friendly admonitions. At some point in the middle of the flight, I woke up parched and realized I needed water to take my medication. I wandered back to the galley. I asked the flight attendent who was working our side of economy. She looked at me blankly like a deer in the headlights and did not respond. That left Mr Charming to bark at me: ""GO SIT DOWN!"" No water of course. He then came on the intercom to yell at everyone that the seatbelts sign was on and to sit down. This was not a flight with much if any turbulence; I think they just mainly used it to manage us. There was another flight attendent who was wearing so much after shave you could smell him from the far aisle of the plane. I cannot tell you how happy I was when we finally landed in Dakar and this cranky bunch deplaned. The last leg was relatively uneventful. Once I got back, I emailed SAA customer service to tell them my experience with the flight crew. I've been back nearly three weeks and have heard ZERO from SAA. Guess this is how they operate?

Over 10 years we travel this very long flight every year but the comfort of the seats is getting worse every year. No upgrade of the seats has been done in all these  years. The food was terrible which is a first time for me. The crew was very pleasant. The cabin was like a freezer and nobody would do anything about it despite many complaints.

"The way there was fine other than they ran out of one of the meal options a few rows into serving and we were near the back. The SAA desserts are really forgettable. The children received their meals first and had more than enough which was helpful.
On the return trip to Johannesburg, a number of TV sets were not working and, despite resetting the rows, it they did not work. The maintenance crew needs to check these on aircraft. The plane was generally clean and we were served well.
I can't rave about the flights but there are no major concerns either.
Their flight times in and out of Mauritius are much better and preferable to Air Mauritius.
Because we were flying with very young children, the staff were always very helpful in assisting us to the front of the check-in queue to make boarding easier and that was appreciated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristiL87,Christi L wrote a review Sep 2018,Christi L,,23 contributions,5 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r615612979-South_African_Airways-World.html,A means of transport,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently had a series of three bad experiences on Mango Airlines owing to undue delays in departures, one after the other. I therefore decided to use SAA instead, at higher cost. After three subsequent SAA flights I was very satisfied. They were on time, comfortable seating and legroom, pleasant experience altogether. Until today's return flight (Monday 10 September 2018) from Durban King Shaka to OR Tambo on SAA flight SA578.

I had already checked in 24 hours ahead of time, online, for convenience to airline and myself. I arrived into the terminal building at Durban King Shaka 30 minutes before departure, when flight boarding had only just started. Hastily made my way through Security checkpoint and towards the departure gate (A10). Upon arrival at the boarding gate, at seventeen (17) minutes before departure time to be exact, I found to my utter surprise that the gate officials were packing up and closing the gate! They claimed that I ‘was late’, and that boarding was complete - even if I had been already uploaded, and in time, arriving seventeen (17) minutes before scheduled departure time at the gate. They said that I had been offloaded from the flight, and that my boarding pass has a note (in FINE print) that the airline closes the gate fifteen (15) minutes before departure.

IF there was such a stringent and inflexible rule for whatever reason, I, for one, have never seen it rigidly applied in all of my multitude of flying experiences, locally and worldwide - not with me nor with anybody else.

1. There was no notice to me at the pre-Security checkpoint where my boarding pass was scanned into the system, i.e. that I must rush, or that I am at risk of being offloaded.
2. The SAA ground staff gate officials said that I will have to go back through Security and purchase a new ticket. This was the last SAA flight for the day so it would have had to be another airline.
3. They did not even make the slightest of attempts to call for an exception with the specific SAA flight controller or the commanding officer of the aircraft, to still allow me on the flight. There was AMPLE time to accommodate me (even as a last remaining already-checked-in passenger). If they had done that, the flight would still have left on time (even ahead of time if that is what this was all about).
4. I was forced to back-track, back through Security, and buy another ticket from Mango, on their last (and reportedly fully booked) flight to OR Tambo. They kindly assisted and managed to somehow get me a seat, although I had to pay full ticket price.

My questions are simple:

1. WHY? Why would SAA treat their customers who has a fully paid and valid ticket at ca. R1200 cost (one way), and who are already checked in, in this manner?
2. How did my arrival at the boarding gate, seventeen (17) minutes before scheduled departure time, inconvenience the flight, its passengers or its crew? It would have taken me one (1) minute to get from boarding gate to aircraft door entrance.
3. Is this where SAA’s customer service levels and standards have dropped to, i.e. to NOT go the extra mile when customers need it most?

I will be putting in a claim to SAA to recompense me for my financial loss and this highly unsatisfactory, unfair and quite arrogant treatment. I will wait to see how they respond, before I decide to fly with SAA again.

PS. I have learned that Mango Airlines has since upped their game and are mostly back to on-time departures again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/03/23/55/andrelombard.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreLombard,AndreLombard wrote a review Sep 2018,AndreLombard,"Pretoria, South Africa",106 contributions,29 helpful votes,Durban - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r615548818-South_African_Airways-World.html,Be warned!

"This is the first flight that I've done in which stewardesses spent their time to chat with each passenger in such a warm way. They literally greet each passenger and talked with them while serving for foods. Not only formally greet them with a smile.

I asked to move to an empty row to sleep, and when I woke up, they made sure that I had a good sleep (Of course I did).

I didn't request for moslem meal, but I don't know how they always offered me it. This is such a big surprise for me in which I'm really grateful.

The short flight from Johannesburg to Maputo was also nice. In a 45minutes flight, I got a halal sandwich? Just Wow ^^.

"For a long flight, the trip was remarkably easy. The service, food and wine were all fantastic and were highlights of the flight.

The seat was a standard business class size seat which fully reclined and had more adjustment options than I knew what to do with. There was a plug for charging devices, an adjustable reading light and an optional privacy divider between you and your neighbor. Passengers are also provided with a kit with toothbrush, hairbrush, lotion, ear plugs, eye cover, etc. It was comfortable enough and a long enough flight to get at least a reasonable amount of sleep.

On the downside, it is a bit of an older plane, so the entertainment system is dated and I noticed some people having difficulties with the functionality of their seats.

Bottom line: If you are looking for a new, luxurious plane, this flight is not for you. However, if you can look past the older equipment, the convenience of the direct flight and the excellent food and service make this a great option.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/57/1f/c8/kristin-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127kristinl,Kristin L wrote a review Sep 2018,Kristin L,"Morristown, New Jersey",12 contributions,,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r614722224-South_African_Airways-World.html,Convenient Direct Flight,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flying from Auckland to Johannesburg via Perth means there is no realistic choice of a service provider. The SAA ticketed journey was significantly cheaper than Air New Zealand or on any of the other routes available.
The equipment was the Airbus A340 and the business class cabin is configured in pairs of seats. It offers a lie flat bed that is not as comfortable as those on the Dreamliner or 777 but I did get some sleep. The meal served was a bit below par for a business class service but was edible and served its purpose.
Similarly, the staff were friendly and obliging but I felt that they lacked that extra factor that one expects flying at the front of the plane.
Overall though, the crew were courteous, the aircraft was clean and modern and the flying crew were very good, way more communicative than on other airlines.

"Traveling economy on South African Airways (SAA) was great. It beats United Delta and other American carriers. The big thing was great leg room compared to the US Carriers. The staff were polite and service great and with a smile. The baggage was handled without incident. Food was per economy standards.
Flight both ways was punctual. Restrooms were clean.
Please keep in mind it was about a 15 hour flight both ways.
Direct flight was attractive as there were no layovers.
Airfare was cheaper than Delta direct

No outlets in economy for charging laptops etc.

Another advantage was that on the way back from Kruger Nelspruit airport out bags were directly checked in to New York as we had a layover of 6 hours before we took the flight back from Johannesburg to New York.

There are lounges on Johannesburg airport where you can pay and spend time includes food, drinks etc.
Frequent Flyer miles. SAA is part of star alliance and the mileage can be obtained on United Frequent Flyer program.

All in all for economy SAA was good value.

We left London late (French Air traffic controllers strike). Captain on flight was very good at keeping everyone informed of what was going. I did wonder why the problem had not been sorted before the flight was due to take off? Air Stewardess in Economy was very unfriendly. After we managed to take off I heard her comment she was “so tired” it was the beginning of the flight!!! They served the drinks and meals. No smiles or friendliness. I have never seen such grumpy staff (fly with different airlines 5+ times a year). Our return flight was slightly better. We were put on standby. Having booked 10months in advance. When we reach Jo’berg Airport. We were told as a family we could not sit together as we hadn’t booked in. We had tried to book in twice 24hrs before & Victoria Falls Airport. They managed to check us in as 2 and 2 (family of 4). It was the best they could do.

"The flight was pleasant. Everything went according to plan from the moment I checked in till I reached my destination. The staff was friendly , helpful and efficient at the check in counters, boarding gates as well as staff on board.The breakfast meal that was served was good. The staff was very caring and patient as passengers have their different quirks and needs.  I enjoyed being able to enjoy in flight entertainment on the screen right at my seat - games, movies or music, while on board. I dont always get to experience that on SAA. Most times its a screen above where you have to crane your neck, and watch a generic show only at certain times of the flight. So that was a plus on that specific domestic flight. I wish it could be so on all flights. Where you as the passenger could choose your on board entertainment from the selection of SAA. The legroom could be greatly improved.

"We had a 2 hour layover in JNB and missed our flight due to delays and poor instructions my SAA staff. Our JFK-JNB flight was delayed by nearly an hour. The pilot insisted this was unusual and here was nothing they could do but in looking at flight stats, it’s obvious that this flight is often delayed.

We didn’t “make up the delay in the air” and were promised that ground crew would be at the plane to assist those of us with connections. There was no one there, or along the customs route sonwe continued to the luggage drop off where they refused to take our luggage and directed us to the SA Airlink desk upstairs were we waited, watching the minutes tick away until we were called to the ticket agent only to be told that since we had our boarding passes they should have taken our luggage downstairs or allowed us to carry our luggage on since we only had 35 minutes to make our flight at that point. Now we had 20 and could try to run. Which we did, and the bus to the plane had already left and the gate was closed.

We ended up having to go back to SA Airlink and rebooking.

We had 5 domestic flights during and all closed the gate 15-25 minutes before the flight to load the bus, all flights were half empty, all served a light meal, even for flights that were only an hour. Special meal requests were not honored and no gluten free meal was provided for my travel companion. The provided meal was reliably delicious (roti, sandwiches, chicken salad etc). Seats were small.

SAA did not honor seat requsts booked through their codeshare partner (Jet Blue) and we were stuck in middle seats for the way home. Jet Blue connecting flights were delays because of weather on both returning and departing flights, weeks apart, so I would recommend the IAD-JNB route instead.

"I flew in a window economy class seat from Sao Paulo to Johannesburg. This was an 8.5-hour flight, on an Airbus A330. The seating configuration is great, with about 76 percent of the seats being with window or aisle seats on this long haul flight. With the window seat, I was able to lean against the window and got some sleep. Usually, I prefer aisle seats, but often I get awakened by people going down the aisle and bumping into my leg, arm or shoulder. Being a Gold member of the Star Alliance air travel program, I received complimentary priority boarding, which gave me a good opportunity to store my backpack and arrange things for the flight. I selected the airline primarily for the flight duration time, price, my experience flying with South African Airways, and the benefits of flying with a Star Alliance, airline partner. The flight attendants were friendly, attentive, helpful and delivered satisfactory in-flight service.

"South African sent us an offer to upgrade our two hour flight for which we paid about $120 per person. We figured we would do this as we didn't know the Windhoek airport and it could make it easier for us. When we got to the airport, they were offering the same upgrade for less than half the price. We stood in line for over two hours because they said they were taking care of the flight to Cape Town and couldn't check us in. By the time we went through immigration and security, we couldn't use the lounge as there was no time. Upon boarding the plane, we were asked for our boarding passes at least 3 times by different agents. My husband helped me carry up my bag as we had to go up some stairs to board and because I have a bad back. As soon as we got to the door, the agent there started shouting at my husband to show him his boarding pass. He told him he knew where he was seated. He had two bags on his hand and couldn't take the boarding pass out of his pocket to show it for a third time. Keep in mind that before going up the steps we had just shown the boarding passes to another agent. He was so awfully rude to us that other passengers seated in business class told the agent to calm down. Unfortunately, he was the flight attendant for business class. We had requested vegetarian meals months before but because of this so-called ""upgrade"" done a few days prior, they had not brought in our vegetarian meals to business class, so we were left without meals as well. It was a very unpleasant ""business class"" experience especially with the rude flight attendant shouting at us in front of other people. That same night I emailed South African's customer service.

Schedule - The flight departed and landed on time.

Attendants - Very friendly and helpful. It did seem like they were having a private party in the galley in-between meal times - some were quite loud about personal topics such as their sexuality which I felt wasn’t very professional - maybe that’s just me.

Food - Average but the attendants offered a second helping of the main dish (first time this has happened) so I was able to try both meals.

"Our little family had a fantastic trip on SAA. Soon after boarding the stewardess explained to us that our infant was too big for the basinet, but she did so in such a professional and caring manor. She then said that we must not worry, but that she is going to find us an extra seat. Luckily the flight was not full and she found us a row of 4. So our little one spread across 2 seats like a queen and slept for 10 hours. This left us to relax and enjoy a glass of wine and a movie. SAA’s new plans are also very comfortable, they feel like they have extra leg room and the TV screens are a big improvement. The food was OK, but its airline food and no worse than other airlines.

"Swiss Flight for 2 persons in Business, both Star Alliance Frequent travel members of Miles and More for many years, origin in Malaga – Zurich – Johannesburg – Victoria Falls, and return same airline and Star Alliance. One person has to continue his journey to London - Bogota – Pereira at arrival in Zurich.
The flight down to VF was excellent and we really enjoy our well organized trip and holidays. The nightmare stared at the return flight:
• Same conditions and same Alliance StarAlliance. At the airport after check in to Johannesburg, SA 040 following to the Check in employee was on time so we checked our Luggage to be send trough to Malaga.
• All of the sudden SA040 was shown as Diverted in Transit area, but no more comments
• No further information for more than 2 hours, no airline employee to speak with no info, Passenger where obliges to get out of the Transit area and find out at the StarAlliance airline what was going on, but with chance you got a smile and a quick response, “ I am not in control of the Situation, Johannesburg is taking care, so please wait…..” after 3 hours the information that the flight will arrive at 16.00 h and will depart around 18.00h, our connecting flight to Europe gone.
• Finally we are allowed to eat something after several trips through customs, security checks and Airline office
• At 18.00h the Airline lands, at the same time all passengers are requested to join the gate for an important information, Airline employees announces that the company has send a smaller plain and 48 passengers must stay in the city, the remaining will be sorted out to take the flight to Johannesburg.
• We were lucky, as our agency in Spain did arrange for us an option with KLM from Johannesburg to Amsterdam the same night, to continue to Zurich, but as we lost the connections we were oblige to stay overnight in Zurich, one person had to head to Rome – to go to Malaga, the other on luckier as he could change his flight to the next day to Pereira via London.
• Our luggage arrived one with the passenger the other one 7 days later in Malaga.
• No employee from Swiss, was able to arrange any hotel, nor any cover on first necessary hygiene items nor in Johannesburg, nor in Zurich.
Claim Case no. 1807-LX-12684 is still open since over 30 days. After several correspondences to Swiss no answer, just a word saying that they passed the claim to their Sub contacted company South African Airlines, member of StarAlliance.
The delay and the consequences, including telephone charges to Spain in order to change tickets, hotels, first hygiene items, one exchange clothes, Euros 1.484,60 not counting the Daily for 2 lost days at 250 Euro for 2 persons 1.000 Euro. Only the tickets alone in B-Class over 5.900 euro.

The claim is very well based: European Airlines have alliances, agreements within Europa and other the world. If you purchase a ticket with Swiss, Lufthansa MEMBER of STARALLIANCE, is the ORIGIN company in charge for delays, substitutions, claims, etc.
In our CASE no. 1807-LX-12684 Swiss and STARALLIANCE is in charge but still try to avoid the problem passing the matter to their partner company. After many claims no one is moving.

"We traveled from the United States to/from South Africa on South Africa Airlines.  While this is a very long flight, we were pleased with the service of the SAA staff and crew.  The food was good, the flight attendants respectful of people attempting to sleep, and we were kept well hydrated.  I had two minor items that bothered me - 1) the airplanes cannot hold enough fuel to do a non-stop, so we stopped in Ghana on the eastbound leg and in Senegal on the westbound leg.  These stops were only about an hour, but generally chaotic.  For some reason, they feel compelled to completely clean the plane when its on the ground (despite the fact that 90% of the people are still on the plane), and then the interior is fumigated.  2) the aircraft we were on did not have any USB ports at the seats.

"Flew from Fankfurt to Johannesburg in July and found it to be an average experience.
Staff is professional and handled the food and beverage service effeciently and still provided good service.

Flight was an Airbus A340-600 so not exactly the newest model. The entertainment system was old with a 4:3 monitor and the old remote (with the phone on the back).
Content was limited but up to date.
Since this was a night time flight, this didn't bother me too much.

The seats were quite wide and had a good amount of legroom so I was able to sleep during most of the flight (I usually have a hard time sleeping in flights).

"SAA is in the process of upgrading their long haul fleet and currently operate a really good, brand new, Business Class product from JNB to Washington D.C. Which I am dying to try!

I booked a last minute Business Class rewards ticket through United. What I love about this flight is that it is the only nonstop direct option from JNB to JFK. I take this route a lot to visit family in SA. Although, usually via London, Amsterdam or Paris. So to jump a direct nonstop flight back to NYC was a real treat!

Checking in at O. R. Tambo is awesome! There is a private “Voyager Platinum” checking in desk that I didn’t even know about. My driver from the Four Seasons dropped me there. What a lovely surprise.
Security and passport control can be busy, but this was smooth today.
The Voyager lounge is huge and offers a decent selection of food and refreshments. I grabbed a quick bite and a glass of bubbly before boarding. Boarding for the USA can be complicated but today it went seamlessly.

The Business Class seats on this A340-600 are in a 2-2-2 configuration. Which can be tricky if flying solo - which I was. I had selected a center aisle seat, ensuring I had direct aisle access and avoiding having to jump over a sleeping stranger. Or worse, have them jump over me.

Let’s be clear this is an older seat. But it does lay flat and it has plenty of room. There was a really cool Brazilian lady seated next to me who worked for the UN and we ended up having awesome conversation!
The food was decent - not remarkable. But most importantly, I had a great night’s sleep. A solid 8 hours. Which on a 15 hour flight can make a huge difference. I’m 6’2” and always appreciate a good night’s sleep on a plane! The entertainment system is really outdated and low quality. Which is a drag.
I fly Virgin Upper Class, Air France and KLM Business Class to and from South Africa a lot. These are great products - but for a direct nonstop flight.

"The selection and quality of the SAA entertainment is atrocious. You will spend over 16hrs with limited selection,  terrible TV screens, and the even worse picture quality. One expects much more from a national airline which monopolizes most of that route and is always busy. Between the captain and crew,  messages are repeated several times which makes one think that they do not work as a team.  At some times,  an announcement cut into another.

"Booked on domestic leg to Joburg on business class and it was great. Booked Cape Town to Hong Kong return via Joburg. Got a notification of a flight change that the return flight from Hong Kong was a day later. Trying to change my domestic leg (same airline, different ticket!) was a nightmare. Got it sorted but pointed out that it was a tight connection in Joburg on the return flight where you have to clear customs and immigration first. True as bob, our departing flight from Hong Kong on 26 July took off almost an hour late because they were refuelling and the hostesses had a debate about a fire extinguisher with ground staff. In this time, before take off, the aircon was off in 33 degree heat/himidity, and people were starting to sweat; waving our emergency cards to cool down.  I missed my connection in Joburg by 20 minutes because the ground staff don’t care and even though I ran to get through customs and the next check in, waited forever for my luggage to come off the belt.Then I had a 6-hour wait at the airport to get my next flight and although the delay wasn’t my fault, just got a meagre breakfast voucher.  Although I have a Voyager Premium credit card and the delay from Hong Kong wasn’t my fault, it seemed that some business class seats on earlier flights to Cape Town were empty but I was still forced to kill 6 hours to get the flight home...Customer service by this airline is non existent and even their response on social media channels is non existent.

30 minutes into a 3 hour flight the pilot comes on and informs us they didn’t shut the baggage door properly and we are to spend the next 2 hours flying around in circles burning off fuel so we can land within weight limits. Back on the ground for a few minutes and then off again. No apologies. Approached crew to see if we could inform next flight to Perth that we would be pushing it. Asked we could get off the plane as priority to make flight. No. On the ground we were told you must stay the night and when insisted on running to the gate to try our luck they were no help at all. No informing the gate that we are runnng through the airport We made it just as they were closing the gate. Will our bags make too?

I am a very experienced traveller. This was a trip back in time to 10 years ago. Surly staff. Inedible food. Seats that didn’t work. Small scratched screens. Speaker jack only worked in one ear. 12 movies to choose from. Entertainment system that started an hour into the flight. And turned off an hour out.

"We were amongst the unlucky ones getting into the chaos at the Munich airport last Saturday (July 28). Originally we were scheduled for Vienna, however, all flights were cancelled and our luggage was unloaded in Munich. We decided to use a train back home and asked that our luggage be brought to the home address as it was not possible to get it directly at the airport.
Instead of sending the luggage by one of the flights directly to Graz (several flights per day) the baggage was sent to Vienna - were it still is (August 2).
I spent many phone calls to Lufthansa and South African airways in Germany, however nobody was responsible, and no help was offered. Each service center provided other numbers to contact, and these numbers were either unavailable, or did not respond, or were simply phone numbers which did not exist.
Finally I got an information of the lost-and-found center at the airport in Graz - the only one trying to help.
It seems we are only money-providers for some airlines, but not valuable customers. In addition South African could not provide boarding passes fro the flight to Vienna - and this is the reality of the so called ""star alliance"" .

"Our flight from Johannesburg to Perth was not a happy experience, despite being in Business Class. The seats are very old fashioned, and while they recline - with difficulty - they are not very comfortable; the overnight bedding, while clean, did not improve the comfort - and we had to set it up ourselves as business class crew did not bother (plus we had to fold it away prior to arrival). Food was very disappointing - a dried out salad for dinner, wine was Ok, breakfast most disappointing with tasteless egg offering (the chakalaka beans were the sole redeeming factor). Even worse was the coffee on offer - obviously instant coffee of a type not seen in Australia since about 1978. Service was woeful with trays being thrust upon you before table was set up; minimal empathy with passengers, and no understanding of modern service expectations.
This leg of our flights (commencing on 26th July) contrasted with SAA flights to and from Dar es Salaam on which the service was very good, and the food and wines on offer were very acceptable. Our initial flight from Perth To Johannesburg (27th June) featured OK service, and good food and wine.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parkes199,parkes199 wrote a review Aug 2018,parkes199,"Melbourne, Australia",6 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r601961464-South_African_Airways-World.html,Patchy service and the cabin crew from hell,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is the second time I have travelled to Africa on SAA, and this time around was much like the first. Friendly staff, cramped uncomfortable seats (economy).
What on earth gives with those armrests? It only folds to the vertical, so once folded up, it's even more in the way than if it was left down! The seats are designed by Recaro, but clearly the designer never actually sat in the seat. They are rock hard, narrow even for my skinny butt, and poorly shaped. No footrest either.
I can put up with most inconveniences on a long flight, but those seats take the cake. They are truly awful. Arriving at my destination with a sore back, and butt is not my idea of a good time.
Having said that the staff are friendly and courteous and do their best.
The cabin is not cleaned properly; I found filth in the recess where the remote control goes. The toilet had brown stains under the seat.
The inflight entertainment is basic and old fashioned. No USB for recharging devices.
I love Africa and plan to travel there again in the future, but next time will be with a different airline.

"It was the first time I flew with South African Airways and will surely be the last. At check in I wanted to upgrade using my STAR ALLIANCE frequent flyer miles with Turkish airlines however South African airways wouldn't let me as I was told that I had to call the secondary star alliance airline 48 hours in advance to pre book an upgrade. Something which is annoying as they come under one umbrella of star alliance. The staff were really rude and Jo'burg desk. Expect no smiles and attitude. Next I checked in and Mande my way to the gate where the gate staff check documents and take a picture of your passport again very rude staff and have an attitude. If you ask them a question it is a bother for them to answer. The staff seem not to care and take pride in their work and deliver a below average service. Once that hurdle was crossed I proceeded to the aircraft and sat on my seat. During the 11 hour flight I only was spoken with one member of staff who was doing the meal service other than that when tried to speak with them you only get one worded answers. The crew were extremely loud and seemed to be having their own party in the rear of the aircraft.

"As a Physically Challenged frequent flyer I was forced to choose SAA as my prefered airline EMIRATES, was too expensive due to me departing at the start of school holidays (SAA 316 departed 22 June 2018 ).
Returning home i was boarded virtually last whereas other airlines normally board their assisted passengers first. This is ludicrous as when boarding last we struggle to place our luggage close at hand.
Never once was I asked if I required assistance from any of the Airport nor on-board Staff.
I generally never eat on board and when flying EMIRATES they will ask you why you not eating and Diplomatically offer you a snack or fruit but never on this flight. The snack offering was poor and as South Africa produces world-class fruit its strange I could not get an apple or any fresh fruit. As for the UAE yoghurt offered, it was terrible and meant to taste like strawberries which I could hardly taste.
Whilst taking a walk around the plane after flying about 6-7 hours I saw a staff member emerge from their upstairs sleeping area in his pyjamas and proudly walked around in the galley. This is UNPROFESSIONAL to say the least.
I've decided in future never to fly SAA again and choose another date irrespective of the price.
I tried unsuccessfully to secure a seat closer to the washrooms as behind these seats I can store my Prosthetic Leg as 13 hours without having to remove my prosthesis causes skin rashes which then take days to dry & heal.

"South African flights between JNB and JFK are direct. The shortest route. That's nice. And cheaper than others. Also nice. Actually, every seat sold is heavily subsidised by the South African taxpayers. Also nice. But the big subsidy means the planes are always full, full, full. Not so nice if you enjoy an empty seat next to you.

This route is hard. It is a tough trip. You have to spend 15 endless hours jammed into a cramped cattle class seat in an old plane with no power points and a retro seatback TV from the 1980s. Some of the audio points don't work. Tough. Luck of the draw. Some of the TV's don't work. Tough. Live with it. The plane is full - you can't move.

If you are not going to/from NY, but are connecting in the USA, look hard at Delta flying direct Joburg to Atlanta as a better option. The planes are modern, with power at the seats and WiFi and a way better, real, up to date entertainment system. The Delta seats are still horrible, but the flights are not as full.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigallan-za,craigallan-za wrote a review Jul 2018,craigallan-za,"Durban, South Africa",35 contributions,64 helpful votes,Johannesburg - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r597677622-South_African_Airways-World.html,Fifteen long hours,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The check in at OR Tambo was quick and efficient but thereafter you would have to hope you don't have a plane to catch because you could be late!! There was one person on duty at the customs counter...really at 08h30 on a Friday morning? Eventually they brought on 4 other staff members. The safety and security check is a joke. The person who should be studying the screen for unwanted items was having a loud conversation with someone 2 counters away - not even looking at the screen. This is surely not how it is done and certainly does not happen in other parts of the world. They take this job quite seriously! The coffee vendor was oh so slow! The flight to Walvis Bay was not on the departure screen at any time so there was no indication that it was departing late (which it was!). On our return the customs was far more efficient but once again the arrival of the flight from Walvis Bay was not on any screen and we had to walk from carousel to carousel to find our luggage.

This is a good airline and the staff service seems to be improving on their grooming and body image. The older air hosts could be more friendly in their approach they are far too proffesional and sometimes unhappy looking. I do feel that the pricing on SAA is becoming too high even weeks prior to the flight. The prepared food is great although some of the elements on the plate need to be of a better quality or they should not serve it. Also the wine selection in economy is horrible to be frank. This is SAA and should offer inbound tourists a taste of our better vineyard options. I had the Balance Sav Cab which was not pleasant. They get 4 stars due to the quality of the fairly new airplane. The airline should now add charging ports for electronic devices..,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f2/38/c7/granth490.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrantH490,GrantH490 wrote a review Jul 2018,GrantH490,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",321 contributions,85 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r596835769-South_African_Airways-World.html,Always a safe option,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The aircraft was as good as 'brand new' and I made a positive comment to the hostess on boarding and that's as far as a pleasantness went! The flight starts with a spraying of the aircraft, which is so '70's'. One of the flight attendant's wore a raincoat throughout the service, not sure what this mean't, but it looked sloppy and I've never seen this before.
After the meal was served she walked through the cabin to the back of the aircraft flaunting a business class meal and sat in the back of the aircraft eating it while reading a book titled 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F__K'. She had obviously taken on advice from the title of this publication. She told the passenger in front of me that this book is 'all the rage'.
At one point I required the bathroom and seeing as she was now ensconced in the crew seat I was told in no uncertain terms to stand behind the curtain and not next to the bathroom in the galley area.
I am a tour operator and fly many airlines around the world. I have never experienced such arrogance on any airline that we have used in the last 21 years in the travel business.

"SAA will not be around for much longer. Financial associated issues aside the cost of courteous and professional staff is one cost free area the ailing airline could attempt to use to keep customers. We flew SAA on the Perth to JHB leg and from JHB to Vic Falls and return and on all flights we experienced terrible customer service.....yes there were one or two pleasant ones, I do not want to paint everyone with the same brush.....but for the most part we were disappointed; at one point I was openly interrogated about my Kindles on/off status and told I was lying about it being off.....what the?! The staff were loud in the galley and at one point were seen in there wearing pyjamas and with hot water bottles relaxing with the staff on duty.

All things aside, parties in our travel group had entertainment systems that didn't work on a 10+ hour flight, the handset was covered in food crumbs and had parts missing showing wires.....on our flight back some toilets weren't working leaving 5-6 people lining up at some points.

The primary benefit.....a direct flight from Perth to JHB.

These issues can only be put down to poor maintenance and bad culture and I sincerely hope the airline can turn these around.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26jasonw,jason w wrote a review Jul 2018,jason w,"Perth, Australia",58 contributions,25 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r596098647-South_African_Airways-World.html,Smiles cost nothing,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My partner & I did fly with South African Airlines (A340 both legs) Johannesburg to Cape Town return in November 2017.
Good things bout this airline
(1) Check in process was quick, friendly and no drama at all on both JoBurg & Cape Town air ports.
(2) In flight customer services was ok.
(3) Seats were comfy and nice and clean.
(4) Lavatories were clean.

Bad things about this air line (in November 2017)
(1) It was bit expensive for a less than 2 hour flight. One way was about AUD220.00 per person.
(2) At JoBurg air port, both times, we had to get on to a bus and travel to the air craft by bus. There was no gate for the flight!
(3) My partner is vegetarian and his meal was ordered when we booked the flight but never turned up. They did not have a proper meal for him on the flight from JoBurg to Cape Tourn. There was no much apology or any thing they could do. We wrote to the air line but never get a reply!

"It was nightmarish flying from JHB to Mauritius.  Firstly the on-board air-con was not working while passengers were boarding and we were cooking in our seats.

So someone had to run out and get this missing piece of equipment before we could take-off.And then, to add insult to injury, seat 64G's in-flight entertainment system was not working.

"Sorry to say things seem to be going down hill on SSA.  I have gone to Johannesburg 4 times in the past four years.  Each year, it seems that things change just a little making this long haul flight all the more terrible.In the negative:1.  TV System is not reliable.  I often have had no service2.  Four years ago, you were welcome to select your seat no charge at time of booking.  Then it changed so that  you could select the seat on your departure leg only.  Then you had to pay both ways if you want to select seats.  However, if you are OK with what you get at check in there is no charge.  For 16 hours in the air, I want to know where I'm sitting.3.,  One small snack was eliminated from the rotation (a sandwich)  The sandwiches are available in the galley, but no one tells you this.4.  You never know with the flight attendants.  Sometimes they are nice, and other times snappy.In the positive1.  When the service is good its good and the flight attendants are happy when they are happy.  When they are happy they represent South Africa at its best2.  Non stop service JFK to Johannesburg3.  You are able to bid on a seat upgrade to first class.  However you must bid pretty high to get the upgrade (minimum bids apply)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dutch397,Dutch397 wrote a review Jul 2018,Dutch397,"Newark, New Jersey",95 contributions,71 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r594609072-South_African_Airways-World.html,OH SSA,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight from New York (JFK) to Johannesburg (JNB) was delayed by an hour and a half and we had to change gates at JFK, which was a disorganized mess. This could have been handled much better; particularly, since we all had to go through additional security checks at the gate.

On the flight itself, we paid an additional fee to get the exit row seats (45H & 45K) of which there were only two seats figuring we'd have better legroom and the privacy better suited for a couple. The problem with this aircraft (Airbus A340-600) is that the exit row seats are EXTREMELY narrow of which we were warned by Seat Guru. However, worst of all was the air bags embedded in the seat belts that made for an even more uncomfortable flight. And at 15-1/2+ hours, it was brutal.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terrisfun2015,Terrisfun2015 wrote a review Jul 2018,Terrisfun2015,"Los Angeles, California",7 contributions,6 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r594072417-South_African_Airways-World.html,Exit Row Seats Extremely Uncomfortable On Long Flight,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This flight was a flight of nightmares. First a member of our party was denied a boarding pass due to some mistake on SAA's part and a mistake with her passport.

On the plane, we had the most hated of items, a screaming child. This time the flight was delayed by 45 minutes, which made the connecting flight almost impossible to meet.

The attitude of the onboard staff had not improved from the previous flight. If SAA could solve this one issue, I am sure it will be a brilliant national airline.

I paid the extra for a seat with extra legroom, but once I received my boarding pass and located my seat, I had been reassigned to the back of the plane with no explanation or offer for a refund.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aryv59,Ary v wrote a review Jul 2018,Ary v,,33 contributions,6 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r594047524-South_African_Airways-World.html,The same as the last flight,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were lucky enough to use air miles to purchase a business class seat for our trip to Johannesburg and I was super excited.   However, I had previously read that SAS has a 60%+ for not being on time. Our flight fell into that percentage. We departed 1 1/2 hours late with no explanation.  If you ever plan on using SAS and making a connecting flight, make sure you leave more than the standard 1 1/2 - 2 hours between connections.  There were a lot of people on our flight, that because we were late, missed their connections.  Our flight finally departed at 11pm.  My husband and I both decided to take advantage of the lay-flat seats, skip the initial dinner and planned to sleep through and just eat breakfast prior to landing.   I had settled myself in for the sleep, (eye shades on, blankets, etc.) and was just dozing off when I felt a tapping on my shoulder.   The flight attendant was actually waking me up to ask me what I wanted for dinner. This was an Airbus 340. An older one.  The lay flat seats are very hard and not very comfortable.  Please understand that I was grateful to be able to actually lay down and sleep on a 10 1/2 hour flight and for once, not in economy for a long flight.  I'm just reviewing the flight.  I awoke about 7 hours after take off and was a little hungry and just wanted a little something to eat, just to tied me over until breakfast was served. My husband was already awake and had been for the last two hours.  I rang the call button and ask the flight attendant if I could have a cup of tea and maybe a cookies or a snack.  I was informed that the seatbelt sign was on and they couldn't help me at the moment.   Funny thing.  I'm usually really good at noticing that sort of stuff.  I missed that. But, when I told my husband what the FA had said, he started laughing because he said the seatbelt sign had been on for the last 2 hours and there hadn't been a stitch of turbulence. 20min later, the seatbelt sign was finally turned off and the FA did return.  The tea was not a problem, but I couldn't get any snacks because they didn't have any.  They wouldn't give me any food from the dinner I didn't eat and even the tea was a clear inconvenience to her because ""I'm setting up for breakfast!"" (But I did get the tea) and thank god I always travel with my own snacks otherwise I would have chewed my left arm off as I was so hungry.   Breakfast was . . . ok. Nothing to write home about, but it was food and satisfied the hunger.  The guy across the aisle from me gave the cooked breakfast back saying it was not good. Entertainment is old school tv's and so during descent, they will not let you continue watching.  Also, personal devices are not allowed to be watched during descent, even if you have it in airplane mode.If you plan on travelling with South African Airlines, be wary.  The business class is not up to the standard of some of the other airlines out there.  Go with low expectations . . . and your own snacks.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Advisor191966,Lisa R wrote a review Jul 2018,Lisa R,"Calgary, Canada",25 contributions,7 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r593764609-South_African_Airways-World.html,Awful customer service,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've now flown 5 long haul flights in coach with SAA in the past 4 months so I have considerable experience with their product.  It's pretty average: I would neither prefer nor avoid this airline.  On time performance has been good: 4 out of my 5 flights were on-time.  Aircraft tend to be a bit old and the technology in the cabin unreliable.  Like you never know if your entertainment system headset jack will work (about half the time, I get sound in only one ear).  The selections on the entertainment systems are limited and outdated.  The food on board the aircraft is no better than adequate.  Their int'l business class lounge at JNB also has below average food and low quality wine.

"As a frequent flier it's always fun to join an SAA flight at a foreign airport and hear familiar accents.
We're all proud of our national carrier but also aware of the difficulties it is facing
For a passenger the issue of safety is a given but the things that make a journey pleasant are catering, entertainment and service.
On this flight only two boxes were ticked for me.
Box 1, we got home safely.
Box 2, meals were good and offered more choices than one expects in economy class.
Box 3, entertainment was very poor.My arm rest handset was not functioning. The picture and sound quality made it impossible to watch anything and the touch screen was a nightmare. On a long journey this is unacceptable.
Box 4, as far as service levels are concerned the flight was full and the staff had to focus to get their job done. In our compartment two staff managed each side.
Three of them were great in all respects but one spoiled it for his colleagues and the passengers.
Haughty to the point of rudeness he managed to put everyone's back up.
In my case I asked for a second bottle of wine to keep for the dinner service and was told I hadn't finished my first one as he walked away from me.
Later in the early hours I walked down to the aft galley and asked for a bottle of water. The look I got from this chap was not attractive.
So the point I make is that little things can make or break our airline experience and, things being as they are, SAA really needs to raise the bar if it is to outshine its rivals.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/376nickp,Nick P wrote a review Jul 2018,Nick P,"Eshowe, South Africa",25 contributions,2 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r592513558-South_African_Airways-World.html,Seat 49G Friday 29 June,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew to South Africa to join a tour. The plane, while in reasonable order, appeared to be similar to one I flew in 5 years ago so I am guessing that it is that old and it shows.

To make matters worse, passengers lost power for 30 or 40 minutes which meant my seat was halfway in the recline position and there was no viewing movies for that time.

﻿SAA have always had the friendliest staff. Now they have the right product to match their staff. The business seat configuration is 1:2:1 which is very pleasing for those traveling on their own. Seats are wider and way more comfortable than before and the entertainment system is the latest on the market. Food was of an acceptable standard if you are inclined to eat on planes. The local wine is definitely a notch up on the last plonk list. For such a prominent wine producing country the wine served over the last few years was shocking. The new wine list is a good advert for the country. Overall this was a great step up for the airline and hopefully they can make a profit and stay flying.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/e2/5c/dd/johannesburgalan.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohannesburgALAN,JohannesburgALAN wrote a review Jul 2018,JohannesburgALAN,"Sandton, South Africa",98 contributions,77 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r592205028-South_African_Airways-World.html,New SAA planes and service is  a winner.,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well where do I start.

When I tried to board my flight from Nairobi, I learned that South African Home Affairs purposely did not lift a travel restriction which expired in January of 2018. I even had the documents to prove my eligibility to travel but SAA was having nothing of it. So I wasn´t allowed to fly.

Now the Kenyans working in Nairobi did contact Home Affairs, and I was cleared to travel the follow day. The manager even rebooked my flight for free, which must have made somebody angry, for when I arrived at Immigration, I was purposely detained so I missed my flight to Cape Town. Obviously Home Affairs and SAA were working together to ruin my trip.

The next day when I went back to the airport, SAA in OR Tambo airport claimed they have nothing to do with Home Affairs, and unlike the staff in Nairobi, they refused to rebook my ticket, and insisted I buy a new ticket.

At that point I refused to spend any additional money in South Africa and caught a flight to Windhoek, Namibia.

So I have made a formal diplomatic complaint to the US Embassies in Johannesburg and Windhoek, and am in the process of filing lawsuits against SAA, whilst reporting them to the Kenyan, South African, and US Civil Aviation Authorities. I am also preparing a lawsuit against South African Home Affairs.

Lesson: Do not travel to South Africa, and certainly do not fly SAA.

South Africa is a country which simply rips off tourists to such a degree, and has such contempt for foreign visitors I have to say I will never go there again, as it is basically a country where the laws simply do not matter, and government officials regularly use their power to pursue personal vendettas.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V5546HHericv,Eric V wrote a review Jun 2018,Eric V,"Windhoek, Namibia",27 contributions,13 helpful votes,Nairobi - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r591162456-South_African_Airways-World.html,An absolute shambles- DO NOT FLY SAA (Or visit South Africa either),Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am usually extremely wary of SAA as they are known for their bad service but this time on both the outgoing and incoming leg of the flight, I was absolutely flipping delighted. The staff smiled and laughed and on the way back Helen Smit took a passenger to task for not listening to the rules and putting her blanket away. The passenger tried to laugh it off but for Helen it was not a laughing matter. Safety of the passengers and all of us was paramount.

Nothing was too much trouble and the aircraft was shiny and new as well as clean. The seats could have been further away from the front but all airlines are going the route of more people less space. The captain was friendly and kept us informed of what was happening and the check in and checkout was smooth and without incident.

I order Vegetarian when I travel alone in case of food poisoning no matter which airline I travel and I have visited 82 countries on more than 20 airlines and trust me they all order food from the same source so you can never be too careful. My food arrived and was piping hot and absolutely delicious. I couldn't fault anything on the plate. Not for breakfast or for dinner.

When I arrived at the boarding gate, there was a supervisor showing the staff how to greet passengers and reminded them to smile and be nice and that was a welcome change. When I had to change my ticket from one date to another, the call centre was just fabulous. She heard my tears as the visa people were awful and I had had a terrible experience with VFS Visas. They waived the change fee and charged me only the change in ticket price.

To all the staff at SAA Well done and I will be doing a review with photos and story in the latest print copy of Anytime Magazine which is distributed to South Africans worldwide.

"We travelled SAA as we wanted a direct flight.  The flight was delayed by an hour due to technical problems and the food needed to be transferred to another plane. We unfortunately only found this out after we boarded as there was no announcement to say the why the plane would be  delayed it was just flashed on the information board and announced we would leave late and they didn't give a time.  We waited just over an hour and as we were taking off the Captain apologised for the delay. We were situated in 2 seater on the left of the plane and on the middle 4 seats of the plane 4 well dressed very noisy South Africans were seated ( 3 men and 1 woman.)  When the airhostess served drinks she warned them that they might be friends of the other staff but she was strict. Well that was the last of the strictness. It was now close to 10pm.  There were obviously other people they knew on the flight as there was in particular a lady passenger that stood right next to our seat who also did not know how to behave on a flight and stood right next to our seat speaking very loudly to them and one of the pursers. She moved backwards and forwards to chat. This carried on well after supper was served. By now the lights had been dimmed and my husband and I had asked them to please be quiet to no avail. We did speak to one of the pursers who didn't do a very good job of explaining that everyone around them wanted to sleep.  Eventually at about 2am SA time they settled down only be awakened an hour later by their lady visitor who woke them up and said she was going to do so every hour at the top of her voice!!  Other than the half hearted attempt none of the staff on board tried to keep them quiet. Surely if people do not know how to behave and show respect for others the staff should step in. We were exhausted the next day and at the start of our holiday.  No one sleeps very well on a flight but  can at least close there eyes and rest.  We were no allowed that. Fortunately in the very early hours of the morning the 3 men disappeared and the lady slept, we could hear chatter presumably from the staff area ( where I take it the strict hostess was or in  the galley, but at least not right next to us, though loud enough to annoy others.

"We arrived at checkin desk with seats booked 11 months earlier and confirmed seats to be told we had been downgraded from business to economy. We were not pleased. Some SAA staff were quite helpful but no one could explain why we had been bumped when we had a long standing confirmed booking, why we were not notified in advance, why our travel agent had not been notified, etc etc.
There was no offer of compensation or even the offer of a refund until I formally complained to SAA head office.

"As a critic of SAA , I was pleasantly surprised. SAA offered what one would expect from an airline. To start off, the flight was on time and arrived ahead of schedule on both legs.
The service was courteous and friendly. The food was typical airline food but it was good and properly presented.
The plane was clean and what is a very tight schedule. Cabin crew were surprisingly friendly, courteous and constantly attending to passenger needs .

"South African Airways domestic service is a disaster.  We had several flights booked and not one was on time.  As an average they were all around 3 to 4 hours late.  Even more frustrating, no information, advice or guidance as to the problem was ever offered.  You were left in the dark with a backlog of passengers behind you in the departure lounge, and not even a bottle of water was offered.

"What a disappointment!  We were so excited when South African Air announced Air Link service to Maun, Botswana since we have never been thrilled with Air Botswana; but it was an awful experience and is just as bad as Air Botswana!  Our flight was delayed for 3 hours with no explanation regarding why and we almost missed our connecting flight back to the US.  We literally had to run through the J'burg airport and beg to cut in the security line to make our flight.  From now on, it's back to Air Botswana--they have more flight choices despite often being late as well. And, the Air Link plane was filthy, flight attendants were inattentive, and ""lunch"" was awful.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H6469BWlindaj,Linda J wrote a review Jun 2018,Linda J,"Gainesville, Florida",209 contributions,80 helpful votes,Maun - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r587440230-South_African_Airways-World.html,Don't bother!,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown well over 3,000,000 miles in my life and on countless airlines.
In all the years, and all the flights, I can honestly say I have NEVER encountered such mediocre food, abysmal service, and such a rude and unfriendly flight crew as I did on my business class flight to Johannesburg on May 29, 2018 out of JFK.

Not one of the flight attendants ever smiled or was helpful or friendly – and I am not exaggerating-NOT ONE. Anytime I asked for something, they acted like they were doing me a favor. From the moment we embarked, the service was poor.
No food or wine menus were distributed. In lieu of studying what was available for meals, one of the flight attendants read the choices to us in such a low voice that we had to ask her 3 times to repeat. She was not only impatient, but insolent when we politely asked her to repeat.
I was traveling alone, but the gentleman sitting next to me was South African and he was furious at how we were treated. He told me he had never experienced the unfriendly and nasty atmosphere that prevailed on our flight.
Unfortunately, for my business class return flight home to JFK from Johannesburg on June 6th, while we did receive menu’s, this time the entertainment system wasn’t working properly. In addition, only one of the flight attendants smiled.
You can be sure that I will do whatever I can to avoid flying South African airline again.

"South African Express flights were grounded. We received a phone call as we were en-route to the airport that a flight now at +/-13h10 was on the tarmac and would be departing - that call was 25 minutes before this flight departed, of course we would not be able to get their on time !! Our original time for departure was at 14h45. Needless to say we did not make the 13H10 flight so were put on the Walvis Bay to Cape Town flight and then onto the Cape Town to Johannesburg flight. Brilliant !!! we should have been home at 17:00 but only got home eventually at 23h00. On top of this the Walvis Bay to Cape Town flight was also delayed. Worst is that there is no communication from SAA on why the flight is being delayed. Please keep your passengers informed and tell us, it is so simple. In hindsight and in spite of all the inconvenience I am glad that SA Express has been grounded because one always had the feeling that this airline is unsafe.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/cc/8a/e0/johndemenezes.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmB8619IV,John De M wrote a review Jun 2018,John De M,"Kloof, South Africa",8 contributions,2 helpful votes,Walvis Bay - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r586561012-South_African_Airways-World.html,Customer Service !!!

I complained to SA in writing on my return home and they spent more than 2 months ""looking into the case"" with a final decision that they were not responsible! I tried to tell them that I had to return to Nairobi airport the next day to collect our luggage that did NOT make it to the plane in time, but they didn't really care.

"I was on a SAAirlink flight from Pemba to Johannesburg and had an encounter with a power crazed airhostess.

I was given a beer in the departure lounge on arrive at the airport and since it was time to board out it in my carry on luggage.

I proceeded to take my beer out of my bag after takeoff and drink it, too my absolute dismay I was threaten with arreast and told this was totally illegal, now this is new to me as nowhere does it say that you may not consume your own drinks on the plane, secondly why would you be able to buy closed beverages of all kinds at the departure shop if this was so illegal.

I was told that the captain would decide what to do about the situation, thereafter the captain announced that disobeying the crew can result in arrest, something I never did, unless she considered me saying “ it does not say that you can’t comsume you own beverages anywhere” being disobedient?

"We flew round trip direct from JFK to Joburg in May which is challenging enough at 16 hours each way.

But the planes are so old now that the seats are soft, uncomfortable and the headrest does not stay in place. Our entertainment system was broke on both flights and while it was relatively limited to a few of us on the way out (despite about 5 full system resets), on the way back the whole plane was without access.

Meals were OK but there was minimal proactivity from the flight crew in between for water etc. that you get on most other airlines on journeys of this length.

Basically, the planes are not maintained well enough to endure the utilization they are getting but with a monopoly on the route, I don't think SAA care.

"I travelled from Perth to Durban, via O R Thambo international airport.
There were some slightly cheaper options to get to South Africa, but these involved lengthy stop overs.
The flight from Perth to Jhb was good. Hey, if you deliver what you promised, you can’t really stuff it up. I travelled early in the week (Monday evening), so maybe that’s why the plane wasn’t very full and I could stretch out.
The flight from Jhb to Durbs on the other hand, although booked with SAA, was operated by Mango. Being a budget airline, meals are a chargeable extra. I’ve flown with budget airlines before, but was never willing to pay extra for meals. This time I thought I’d give it a try. R50 odd bought me a beer and a pastrami sandwich.

"This was my first experience booking a flight with SAA and I will NEVER purchase anything from them again.I wish I could give them zero stars. I never show up to flights late and I always plan for heavy traffic. Which is why when I left my house 5 hours before my scheduled flight (mind you, it only takes 45 minutes to get to the airport from my house) I thought I would be okay. Little did I know, it would take 3.5 to get to the airport. When I got to the airport, SAA ticket counter was CLOSING and they refused to offer me a refund, change my flight, or help in any way at all (even though, according to them, the flight wouldn't be taking off for another 1.5 hours since I didn't show up 2 hours before flight departure they couldn't do anything). Instead they gave me the airline number and said I should contact them to book a standby flight for tomorrow for $300 plus a $600 for the ticket difference. I thought this was a rather gross penalty for being 30 minutes late to a flight but I agreed to pay the fine and called the airline. When I called the airline they said they said my best option was to go back to the airport and ask them to book a standby flight instead for cheaper. By the time I got back to the airport all of the phone lines were dead (SAA doesn't have a 24 hour call center so good luck getting help for ANY flight after 5:00pm) and there was no one at the airport to talk to. I called again the following morning and before I even got out a word, the SAA call center supervisor was extremely rude and informed me there was nothing she could do to help me. Mind you, I hadn't explained the situation or said hardly three words. I had to actually talk over her to get a single word in as she was intent on screaming at me. When I finally explained the situation they said I had to now pay $600 in addition to the $600 ticket difference. They said it was because I was a ""no show"". I tried explaining that I was not a no show - that in fact I was at the airport 1.5 hours before the flight departed and even returned to the airport when they told me to. The customer service was so bad that they actually HUNG UP on me while I was on the other line telling them I still needed help. All in all, SAA willfully tried to scam me into paying $1200 ONTOP of the $1100 I had already paid for my flight. Their call center was verbally abusive, snarky, and dismissive cutting off every sentence I uttered and droning over and over again that there was no way they could help.

SAA is a thief and a monster. This is my first and last time giving them any money and to the day I die I will never use this airline again. As God is alive, I know they will plummet for the evil they are doing and the money they try to steal from people will be taken from them 10 fold.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/653blesseds,Blessed S wrote a review May 2018,Blessed S,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Washington DC - Accra,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r583863082-South_African_Airways-World.html,SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS - THE BIGGEST SCAM ARTIST OF THE CENTURY,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The pros : flight on time

The cons : boarding by bus is always an annoyance, particularly when you need to wait long for the 2nd bus to arrive and to park at the gate. Small aircraft as on Tuesdays SAA are using a A320 to fly the route. Catering has been going down year after year on SAA. On regional flights you don’t even get a real napkin, more like a tiny paper tissue big enough to be placed under a coffee cup. Cutlery is served in a plastic bag and most of the dishes are on a tray, except for the main course served separately. Being on a A320, don’t expect any IFE either. In the past SAA were giving tablets with some old movies, but this seems also to have been discontinued.

"The airline is boasting with the claim: best airline in africa and star alliance member.
I traveled now several time with SAA and the planes are poor, dirty and defect. On a 10 hours flight to Windhoek my entertainment system did not work and it was not the only one. The crew was not able to change seats or to fix it. We were standing almost 1 hour at the gate in the plane and the air conditioning was not working, than the pilot said that the air con is not going to work the whole flight. I was so hot in the plane that I tried to refresh on the toilet, so I stood up and went to the nearest. But a stewardess denied me the access to the toilet I choosed, because it was for the business class. By the way: the air conditioning in the business class worked. Instead of opening the curtains to share the air con the crew closed it and it went hotter and hotter in the eco class. All in all the flight was one of my worst ever and I wonder that such a poor airliner is member of the start alliance. I will never book a flight at SAA again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/c4/d0/3d/seoulfever.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sangpa21,Kido wrote a review May 2018,Kido,"Frankfurt, Germany",27 contributions,40 helpful votes,Frankfurt - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r582591597-South_African_Airways-World.html,Poor airline with low standard,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"As a South African, I am well aware of the controversy around South African Airways and their finances. But fear not they are very professional!

They might also not be the most timely airline in terms of takeoff either but they do make up for it in the air.

I don’t however recall ever feeling unsafe. I flown this route numerous and personally prefer the takeoff and landing times because from my experience the jet lag isn’t too bad.

Also because it is a direct flight, no need to swop planes.

They aren’t the cheapest way to get to Hong Kong return, there are other airlines a fair bit cheaper but I find myself paying the extra for the direct flight and the takeoff and landing times - avoiding to some extent the jet lag.

Thus my overall experiences in the past have only let me complain about their timeliness.

"I bought two business class, one way tickets from Johannesburg to Windhoek on flysaa.com . Booking reference:TDCOIN.
I wanted to stay sometime in Namibia and then decide where and how to carry on my journey. While buying the tickets there was not a single warning that I cannot buy one way tickets on this flight segment.
On 19 of may 2018 when I arrived at Tambo airport at check-in counter I was told that they will not check me in without flyback tickets. I told them that I didn’t not decide yet where I am going to fly from Windhoek. They refused me and my wife in carriage ! They were pushing me to buy the return tickets. But I didn’t want to return. I also asked them why they sold me the tickets and know are refusing in carriage. But received no answer or any apologies.

"The flight leaves early on Saturday as it returns the same day from St Helena. Landing on the island before the wind gets too strong is also a good idea as the airport has characteristic wind shear.
Get to Jhb airport early as the departure gate is very far from checkin, too far for comfort. There is the opportunity to buy coffee and a croissant at the departure gate, thank goodness. A small duty free is also there. The plane is especially selected to handle this flight ( short landing ) with 25 rows of four seats. You land in Windhoek on the way there to ensure the tanks are full in case you are unable to land on the island. Our rear toilet had blocked and was fixed in Windhoek, thankfully. There are multiple snacks served in flight, but we had to stay on board, without air conditioning, in Windhoek. Leaving Namibia, over the 'skeleton coast' was an especially rewarding view.

The island comes out of the cloud and looks as precipitous and gnarly as you'd come to expect. Everyone is on tenderhooks as you make your approach, wing flaps fully extended. As the plane crossed over the cliff it bucked and skew to one side with some passengers overreacting, of course. I had my heart in my mouth I must admit as we slammed down hard and applied full brakes.
It's a quick walk to the airport terminal which is lined with locals just out to watch the landing and they clapped as we entered the terminal. The return flight is uneventful and you don't land in Windhoek on the way home.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cutawaycamo,Cutawaycamo wrote a review May 2018,Cutawaycamo,"Knysna, South Africa",41 contributions,2 helpful votes,"Johannesburg - St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha",Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r582125017-South_African_Airways-World.html,Flight to St Helena was well catered and lived up to expectation.,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"SAA airline ticket purchased in my partner's Married name as stated on her South African passport. No Visa requirements other than an ESTA document from the Canadian Embassy which is issued in the Maiden name of the passenger as stated in her European Passport ( All Italian passports are issued in the Maiden name for females with the Married name on a separate page of the same passport). SAA ground staff refused to accept my partner's airline ticket in her Married name and compelled us to purchase another ticket in her Maiden name. As we were boarding a ship in Vancouver we had no choice but to comply with the unreasonable demands of the ground staff who were not prepared to entertain our arguments that in the past two years we had flown BA to America, Singapore Airlines to Australia, Qantas to Australia in the exact same circumstances with ESTA's issued in her Maiden name and the airline tickets in her Married name. To crown it all, on returning to South Africa from Vancouver, ground staff in Vancouver (Canadian Airlines , SAA code sharing partners) questioned why her ticket was issued in her Maiden name and not her Married name. Exactly the reverse of what was demanded by SAA in Johannesburg. Fortunately the Canadian staff were efficient ,courteous and very helpful in making the necessary overriding adjustments and we proceeded on our way without any further complications.

"In order to get from George to Nelspruit, you have to get a connecting flight in Johannesburgh.

The george to johannesburg leg was cancelled late afternoon on the day before i was to travel. No explanation given, only with a message saying that i can apply for a refund. Had to scramble to book an alternative flight on a saturday afternoon.

There was a 2 hour delay on the jhb to nelspruit flight departure due to our airplane having a leak of some sorts and SAA having to find a other plane.

Yes I am grateful that the leak was detected before the plane departed, but it makes one wonder how the plane passed the inspection in the first place.

Cabin crews on all the flights however are friendly and helpful and so are the pilots. Just think that SAA’s in general has deteriorated and have become unreliable. It is always a gamble flying with SAA when getting a connecting flight as you risk missing your flight due to delays on SAA’s side.

"We had a choice between Qantas and SAA to fly back to Melbourne. We chose SAA based on price and we could visit people in Perth on the way through. The SAA business class lounge was busy, but easy enough to find a place to refresh prior to our 9 hour flight. The furniture, food and drinks were as expected for a business class lounge and the staff were very pleasant.
The plane was quite old and I question whether we had been put into premium economy rather than business class. However, I was quite firmly, but nicely assured that the seats were business class, but not up to the standard one would expect on Qantas or indeed most other long haul flights.
However, the food met expectations and I got a good nights sleep on the overnight flight to Perth.
I would use SAA again providing their business class price was much better than Qantas.
We also used SAA for internal African flights and was satisfied with their service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/8a/avatar011.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macncarole,Macncarole wrote a review May 2018,Macncarole,"Melbourne, Australia",102 contributions,58 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r581905277-South_African_Airways-World.html,Jo'Burg to Perth on SAA,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My daughter is 14 and has been travelling to and from South Africa for 4 years.  One thing that I find unpleasant about this airline is that they tend to harass the child when she is dropping in her luggage.  They keep her on the counter for atleast 15 minutes just cheking her travel documents which should take them less than 10 minutes as her papers are always in order.  Some even pretend that there is something wrong and the child has to correct them and refer them to their site on required documents or she has to insist on them calling me (since I wait until the plane leaves) and that is when they let her go.  It is so frustrating on my part and on her part too.  Why have a provision for unaccompanied kids if you are going to be the one harassing them????,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaramB7104JH,Barbara M wrote a review May 2018,Barbara M,"Lusaka, Zambia",4 contributions,,Lusaka - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r581899871-South_African_Airways-World.html,Unpleasant time at check in desk,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"So little space between the seats I thought I'd mistakenly booked a standing room only fare. The stewards were at the bare minimum of friendly and helpful and it felt like being on a bus. My luggage did not arrive in Johannesburg, where I was told it had been checked through to Cape Town (my final destination). But, on arriving a Cape Town, I was told the luggage was still in London. this meant I had to cancel a pre-booked mountain guide, and two nights accommodation in mountain huts - so the first part of my holiday was a ruined. SAA said I could claim up to £100 US for the delayed bags, which finally arrived at 6pm the following day, more than 24 hours later.

"I flew from Perth , Australia to Johannesburg , SA. The entertainment unit did not work, on a flight which lasted longer than 10 hours.
The staff were totally disinterested. I reported it and they went away to “ fix” and never came back. I had to get up from my seat and walk to the back galley to ask what is happening. They were all sitting around, chatting. The old white male air host, who was suppose to be fixing it couldn’t even get up then, he shouted after me. I was given new headsets, which didn’t work. I handed them back and they took off. I then had to ask again for new head sets. My system did not work for the entire flight.
I subsequently wrote to SAA and 6 months later, I still have not had a reply.
I score them a 5 because they are the cheapest direct carrier between OZ and SA

"A few months ago, my mom and I flew to South Africa to visit family on South African Airways, a partner of United. We booked and paid through United and spent about $12,000 total. The flight there was fine. On our way back, while waiting in the airport, we found out that our flight was cancelled due to bad east coast weather. It took us hours to get out of the terminal with no assistance from SAA personnel. By the time we got to the ticketing booth, we were told that the flight for the next day was full, but we had a confirmed seat on the flight the day after that. They put us up in a hotel but would only pay for one night, so we had to pay an extra $1000 out of pocket.
We returned to the airport two days later. We had been in South Africa for about a month, and we wanted to get home. The lady at the check-in counter checked us in, told us we were in first class, and gave us our boarding passes. Out seats were 7A and 7B, first class seats.
We got to the gate to board our plane, and as they scan our ticket they tell us to step aside because there was a problem. At this point, we had waited 3 days to get on this flight, and they were not letting us on.
As it turns out, the flight the day before had been cancelled also, and our seats were given to people who were on that flight instead of making them wait as were forced to. We had our tickets and seats assignments, but it did not matter to them. They gave up our seats. We were told that we could either fly coach or wait until we could get another first-class ticket which could be days (and, as we learned from this experience, would not be guaranteed.) This was a 16-hour flight, I am very tall, and we were not prepared to be flying coach. Neither of us had pillows, water, or food, but we got on the plane after we were assured that we would be seated together. We, of course, were not seated together.
Because our flights were originally cancelled, we had to cancel our connecting flights through united, which we cannot get a refund for, and we had to pay for new flights. All of this amounted to a loss of $4000 as well as the $6000 from the first-class ticket.
We contacted United and South African Airways right away and were told that a request to refund the $6000 would take a few weeks. So, we waited and called weekly. We would be happy with the difference between the first-class tickets we purchased and the coach ticket we were forced to use. Today we found out that United and SAA denied our refund request and we will be getting no money back from them. I have been travelling my entire life since I have family all over the world and I have never experienced anything this traumatic while traveling, and it does not seem fair to not even receive the money that we are owed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/95/avatar021.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamanthaG1817,Samantha G wrote a review May 2018,Samantha G,,1 contribution,,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r580257205-South_African_Airways-World.html,Horrible and Abusive,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

As Windhoek  is quite a small airport we left about 20 minutes earlier than scheduled which was good news.  The service on the flight was good but the meal could have been better.  They served chicken with rice but it was cold and not very inviting.  We landed at Cape Town airport 20 minutes ahead of schedule but unfortunately no one had told the arrivals team and they did not have the steps or the bus ready.

Waited an hour for the privilege of paying for this overpriced ticket (R4500 return for a 40 minute flight - really?!) and then another 40 minutes in a queue to check in to a half full flight without luggage. Really, really rubbish service from the ground and office staff.

The good thing is that being and old plane is there seemed to be extra knee room from the seat in front compared with more modern planes which have less room. The seats are still quite comfortable.

The airport staff are also less helpful compared with other international airlines, but the airplane stewards are still great.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitchH280,Mitch H wrote a review May 2018,Mitch H,"Brisbane, Australia",4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r580013879-South_African_Airways-World.html,Old fashioned yet comfortable planes,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My wife and I traveled to Nelspruit from Durban on 12/03/18.  We arrived early at 0500 since the flight was scheduled to leave at 0630.  Our journey was from Durban via Johannesburg to Nelspruit. At check in we were issued both boarding passes.  Security check was fairly long taking about 15 minutes.  After having a cup of tea at Wimpy, we boarded the Airbus 319-100 plane at 0600 via Gate A13 through the aerobridge.  We paid additional for legroom next to exit door.

I was assisted in self ticketing my baggage and then I had to join a queue to drop off my bag. SAA share a bag drop with Air India. I had to join the queue.

"Regardless of the necessary criticism SAA has faced for so many years as being a failed business model, especially under a corrupt government, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, or the devil is in the detail. I have flown SAA a number of times, mainly local or mid-range flights (Mauritius, for example, and the latest, to Zim), and I must say the standard is good. With my work I travel extensively, and have mainly used Qatar Airlines (truly 5-star) and of late, Ethiopian Airlines. The latter has been rated Africa's best, and I beg to differ. SAA is still up there. Why? The standard of aircraft cleanliness, and the People factor. Personnel on SAA flights do make a difference, some a result of experience, and (for the younger personnel), training. I can only think of one flight in the last five years where SAA had a motley crew, i.e, lacking cohesion. For the rest, thumbs up for SAA staff, and the standard of your flights.

"Paid to upgrade both legs of the flight. We were business class so priority boarding. We used one of the lounges (Maple lounge ) at heathrow which was great but didn't really get time to do the same on the return journey. The lounge wasn't crowded so we were more relaxed and got free beer and some nibbles. No really good food but okay.
The plane we flew on was really new. The Business class seats are so spacious it's like your own armchair at home.
The foot rest rises and you can have the seat reclined, upright or flat. The flat setting is like a bed and they provided duvets and pillows so you can sleep. It's quite comfy but not really like your bed at home.
There was also a big screen for watching movies etc and posh noise reduction headphones instead of the little cheap ones in economy.
we were greeted on board to champagne. There was a choice of meals which were individually served on proper plates with proper cutlery and even a tablecloth on your meal tray. There was also a choice of wine. The food was above average but could have been better. The stewardess did change my meal for me when it was too spicy.
The crew were quite good but not really attentive enough apart from the meal services.
The flights passed quickly and was pleasant and comfortable.

"We chose South African Airways because at the time we booked they had a good special on flights from Australia. I have to say I won't hurry back.

The plane interiors are tired. Clean enough, but a feeling of being worn.
The economy section did have *just* enough room for my legs. Sadly the seat width was so narrow my poor wife was pinched between the armrests for the whole trip. Unfortunately the arm didn't fold up out of the way so I could share some of my space.

The entertainment system is very slow, with small grainy screens. The range of choices was also really bad. The newest movie was more than six months old and is available in the supermarket in Australia. Not all the screens were working either. On the way over my wife's screen was missing all the yellow, and quite a few screens didn't work at all within sight of my seat.

Dinner was a choice of Beef stroganoff or Chicken curry. I went the chicken, my wife went the beef. I regretted it, as the curry sauce was chemical tasting and the chicken dry, while the beef was lovely.

Breakfast the next morning was just really bad all round. Rubbery eggs that had been kept warm 10+ hours at that point, stale bread, and everything tasted vaguely plasticky. The Tea was actually really good. Fresh, not stewed, not contaminated with coffee and not too strong.

I had an aisle seat, and during the night I was full on bumped awake by several different cabin crew on at least six occasions. Now I may be tall and wide, but not a single passenger managed to knock me awake on a 11+hour flight. Just the cabin crew.

We booked some months before the flight, and at the time I thought it passing strange I wasn't asked about food allergies. Closer to the date I checked my online details and couldn't find anywhere to communicate my allergy to Sesame. When we checked in online, still no questions about food requirements.
Now I may have missed that part of the booking process, but I am fairly careful about these things because if I make a mistake I have a wretched 24 hours of gut pain. It may also have been missed because we used a 3rd party booking system.

O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg at the end of the journey is a shocker. It was 5:30am local time, but the arrivals terminal looked like the airport in the Zombie movie 'Warm Bodies'. There are dozens of cleaners, staff members and security guards standing around, but very few of them actually doing anything. Slow queues and slower service. One security guard spent five minutes we were stuck in a queue in front of him energetically excavating his nostrils and wiping it on his pants.
Everything in the airport is dirty and lots of things like doors, escalators and ceiling panels are broken.

To transfer to a domestic flight we had to collect our luggage and then recheck it, even though our flight was supposedly with the same airline group.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/ec/8a/5d/mark-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QaPla78,QaPla78 wrote a review May 2018,QaPla78,"Katanning, Australia",237 contributions,52 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r578448783-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Average food, bad entertainment, revolting airport",Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Always flew Air Mauritius to Mauritius. This time around we flew SAA cause the departure flight is early morning and the return flight is late afternoon, so we have more time in Mauritius. The flight was good though, nothing to rave about. The attendants were very friendly and the food was okay. The seats are not very comfortable and minimum leg room. It is a pity about the leg room.

Booked a flight one year in advance. SAA did not bother sending me a reminder for change in flight times. No sms reminder! So I missed my flight.

"I am a seasoned traveller and have always, as far as I could, never travelled SAA on any international route except for Kenya as this was the most convenient flight.

Lucky for me, it was a flight a little less than a 2 hours.

This flight has a specific service, where after the ""check-in"" at the boarding gate, you board a bus to take you to the airplane.

"We flew from Johannesburg to NYC in early April, 2018. We sat in the two seats on the left side of plane in row 46. The plane was a bit outdated but otherwise comfortable. Legroom was decent for economy and we were able to stretch out a bit (we’re both ~ 6 ft). The food was standard for international economy and included dinner, snacks, and breakfast. Entertainment system had a good variety of movies (new release) and television but the quality of screen/sound was below average.

"We flew South African Airways flight 346 from Capetown to Johannesburg on an Airbus 346 widebody. We arrived at the boarding gate about 15 minutes before the boarding time printed on our boarding pass and saw that boarding was already underway.

Possibly because we were flying an A346, this was a bus gate. That means we all had to cram into the bus with our carry-on for the ride over to the plane. It was crowded but not too terrible of a ride.

Since this was a remote gate, there was no jetway and you needed to use the stairs to board.

The flight itself was fine -- plenty of overhead space, decent enough legroom and a fairly clean plane. There was no in-flight entertainment but a small sandwich snack was served on this short flight and the flight attendants were friendly and efficient.

Travelled to Victoria falls then back to joberg. South African airways were superb. One of the best airlines we have ever travelled with staff were so helpful and friendly.

"This was a new A380 plane.  Business class has made huge changes, however we did not find the trip comfortable at all. To begin with the elderly air hostess on board was rude upon entering the plane.  She seemed rather stressed and in a hurry to get people out of the way.  I could not get to my seat as their was a lady trying to get into the toilet and she was blocking the aisle which I needed to use to get to my seat.  This old air hostess then reprimanded me as if I were a child who was ignoring her ""command""  I told her I could not get past as their was someone trying to access the toilet.  She then rolled her eyes at me and very sarcastically said ""oooh I see and I 've told you where to sit""  Very unprofessional especially when you have paid R50000 for this type of service.  The new pod like flat beds are extremely uncomfortable and the touch screen TV's are so sensitive that every time you turn around in your sleep they come on by themselves, which causes way too much light in the cabin.  Our flight was delayed for reasons not known to us. (there and back)  This meant we were tired and wanted to rest and enjoy the flight. The inflight entertainment does not compare to other airlines we have flown with. ie Emirates, Turkish airlines, KLM to name but a few.  Each time I accessed the toilet it smelt like a men's urinal and there was tissue paper lying on the floor .I would not fly SAA again in this plane.  Much prefer the old planes which we flew back on and had a good nights sleep.  Also the food was stodgy and not very pleasant tasting.  However on the return trip although the menus were incorrect we were served tasty food.  It really is not pleasant when you are paying such high prices and the ""main air hostess"" is extremely rude, the flat bed is uncomfortable, the entertainment is poor and the toilets are smelly and unclean.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/d4/73/bf/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerJ007,TravellerJ007 wrote a review Apr 2018,TravellerJ007,"Johannesburg, South Africa",193 contributions,23 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r573656014-South_African_Airways-World.html,New A380 not nice at all,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Who would have thunk it but it turns out SAA is a terrible airline. It takes cheapness to another level. The planes are modern but the seats are worse than a park bench and the food is inedible.

Have flown several flights recently. Two long haul from and to London two shorter to Livingstone and one internal. Shorter flights were good. Older planes but okay and sandwich or full meal provided depending on time of day. Long haul from London was good. New plane and comfortable. In flight entertainment a little limited but okay. Meals satisfactory without being exciting. Flight back to London poorer. Older plane and many of the entertainment screens didn't work. Seats not as comfy. Continental breakfast was all dried up and hardly edible. On long haul flights staff seemed a bit distant and not terribly approachable or were a bit grumpy if you asked for anything out of service time.

"Have not flown SAA internationallly for a few years now and it is sad to see that the fleet has deteriorated quite badly.

Plane is really old,seats are not great and inflight entertainment is dated and did not work on one of the flight legs.

The meal used to be good but was really poor this time around.

Know that the airline has some financial issues but not dealing with the fundamentals of having a decent fleet won’t help them navigate out of their issues.

First time flying with SA Airways and as long haul was looking forward to the flight. First of all we had to be moved prior booking in as we were told a lot of the tv’s were not working. Shame as we originally had seats at the front with extra leg room! Got on the plane and were told it was that one of the exit doors were not working! Staff were not friendly at all (sorry) knocking you and seats as they went past with their trolleys and no apologies. I don’t usually moan but I was disappointed. Flight back was a bit better but seats were fairly uncomfortable and hardly slept. Earphones not great as can still hear everything going on over the movie sound. Would try someone else next time.

"I typically fly within the US and the experience here is just significantly better.  I got served dinner on a 1.5 hour flight of beef filet.  This would never happen in the US.  The seat was very comfortable, but I was not in it long either.  There was nothing exciting about the seating area or experience, but I would definitely fly them again.  What I would never do again is use the code share with Emirates.  As a business class flyer for Emirates, you get some cool stuff.  That is unless you add on Emirates from your previous SAA flights.

"First time going to South Africa and the atmosphere was perfect.  Had thought about upgrading, but found out if was way out of my budget.  So I flew Economy.

"Why does SAA fly nearly empty aircraft between Johannesburg and Washington (both ways)? Maybe it's the stopover in either Accra, Ghana, or Dakar, Senegal, that adds a couple of hours to an already long trip (SAA flies non-stop to and from New York). But still, I've flown SAA on a few other routes and it really is a wonderful airline. The crew are incredible, always helpful, always smiling. The aircraft are new and clean, the seats are comfortable, with adequate leg-room, even in economy, and the entertainment systems actually work.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevetan_11,Stevetan_11 wrote a review Apr 2018,Stevetan_11,"Toronto, Canada",54 contributions,36 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r572234111-South_African_Airways-World.html,Best kept secret,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm Platinum Lifetime SAA member, so I know the airline well, and criticize when warranted. This last flight was a real pleasure. Business Class on SAA is quite generous, with 180 beds with an underfoam and duvet. The food was good and the wine selection as really enjoyable. The food is never exceptional, but I thought it was really suitable for such a long flight.
The cabin was clean as were the toilets.And the cabin crew was friendly and did what was expected of them.
Most important to me, was that the flights were perfectly on time, on both legs.

"This is the story of my most recent experience of travelling with SA Express. It is followed by a brief analysis of the issues the airline is facing and what could be done to improve matters.

Wednesday March 14. I am travelling to Barcelona from Gaborone to attend an educational conference and am reasonably excited as most of my travelling for work is done within Botswana. I check in two hours before take-off, say goodbye to the family, go through security and out onto the warm tarmac to board SA1784, the 17:15 service to Johannesburg. Hand luggage is handed in at the steps and we take our seats and listen to the safety demonstration before being sprayed with insecticide. And that is when the trouble starts.

The port engine refuses to start and we are offloaded. It is then I found out that this Dash-8 has been sat on the apron since it originally refused to start at 11am. By this time, some of the morning passengers have been sprayed with insecticide four times. They are mosquito free but not going anywhere.

Once back in the terminal a flustered SA Express official refuses to answer any questions before saying she is going to the office to ‘make a plan’. We do not see her again. After about 20 minutes I chat with a very pleasant gentleman working for SAX and he tells me those with connection are being put on an unscheduled 18:30 flight. In the meantime, an Airlink CRJ200 arrives, is turned around and departs. Our empty Embraer 190 then lands at 18:10, but it takes half an hour to organise who is flying on it and when we do board at 18:40 one passenger is missing and the manifest is incorrect. The passenger is found but the manifest only arrives at 19:10, meaning it has taken an hour to load 30 passengers. We eventually take off at 19:15.

Arriving at OR Thambo at 20:00, it is 10 minutes before the hand luggage is unloaded and our bus takes us under my departing Swiss Air flight to Zurich before dropping us at the terminal. A spirited sprint to the transfer desk sees me and a fellow passenger arrive five minutes too late for the connection. We are helped by a pleasant gentleman and a very energetic older lady at the transfer desk. I am told that there is a KLM flight that would take me via Amsterdam that evening and there are seats available. However, the ticket office closed at 19:30 and they cannot book the ticket from the transfer desk. Several phone calls are made to the Domestic office upstairs which is supposedly open until 21:00, but no-one answers the phone – meaning that half an hour before closing everyone has gone home. I am told there is no more they can do and to go to the transit hotel where there is a voucher waiting. I go to the hotel and there is no voucher so it is back to the transfer desk to get a new one. I am told to come back at 08:00 to rebook my Swiss flight. I check into the hotel at 21:15 and have a R150 supper, courtesy of SAX. At least I am luckier than my fellow traveller. His flights are on separate tickets so he has to purchase a new ticket via his travel agent.

Next morning, I am at the desk at 08:00 to be barely greeted by the early morning shift who are still applying makeup. Indeed, the girl on the next counter takes a couple of attempts and a comical incident with a wet-wipe to get her lipstick right. I am offered lunch and dinner vouchers as they cannot help at the moment, but I am told I should come back at 12:00.
Lunchtime, I am back at the transfer desk to be told I have been rebooked on that evening’s Swiss Air flight but there is a problem printing the boarding pass so I should come back at 16:00.

Back at the desk at teatime and there is a new shift. Unsurprisingly, they know nothing about me and my flight has not been booked. This takes 15 minutes explanation before the gentleman serving me disappears upstairs to the ticket office and returns half an hour later with a new ticket. I check in with Swiss and eventually relax.

The Zurich flight is very pleasant and, despite only having an hour in between connections, I make the Barcelona gate with some time to spare. I arrive three hours late for the second day of my two day conference, but still I am impressed by my hosts and have a great time. Next morning I have time to visit the Camp Nou before returning to the airport.

The flight to Zurich is again pleasant although we land in a blizzard. Again, despite having only an hour between connections, they are easily made and I am soon on board their Johannesburg flight. It is now snowing heavens high and de-icing means that we take-off 40 minutes late but the captain assures us he will make up the time. True to his word, we touch down twenty minutes early at 10:20 Sunday morning.

I am soon at the SAX gate for SA1767 which is due to leave at 11:30. The boarding is delayed and then starts slowly – not a good sign. Sure enough, I am denied boarding along with another 30 passengers. The reason? The 74 seat Dash-8 has a technical problem and has been replaced by a 30 seat Embraer. We are rebooked on SA1777, a new flight, at 14:30. Many passengers are furious and one is in tears. The SAX member of staff dealing with us tells me that technical issues are a regular occurrence and are becoming even more common.

We are given a R70 voucher for a restaurant where the cheapest sandwich is R69. If you wanted a drink of any sort your meal choices were either a muffin or ice cream. Eventually we board ZU-SOB. As we entered there was a noticeable smell of vomit in the cabin and the source was discovered by the lady in 10A whose seatbelt was covered in traces of the previous occupant’s last meal. We arrived in Gaborone at 15:40 to an ironic round of applause. I was too tired to join in.

Between checking in on Wednesday afternoon and returning Sunday teatime I had missed half of my conference and had spent more time in ORT than actually at my destination. However, my experience really only acts to highlight many issues facing SA Express.

Most concerning is safety. On the departure board on Sunday at ORT more than 40% of the SA and SA Express flights were delayed, several for ‘technical’ reasons. Staff at ORT admitted this was a constant occurrence and one of the technicians at Gaborone described our Dash-8 as ‘finished’.

Some staff I spoke to were hoping that the proposed merger with a slimmed down SAA would help overcome the maintenance concerns. By keeping a smaller fleet of the newer aircraft, their thinking was that service issues would be minimised. It has to be questioned, though, whether merging two failing airlines with similar management problems can lead to success.

Communication and service are problems all companies face and dealing with your customers, even though they are not always right, is key to success. SA Express’ communication with its passengers was almost non-existent. Two members of staff did stand out for offering realistic information, but even then I had to seek them out. In an age when I can book a flight anywhere at any time using my phone, it is unbelievable that SAA/SAX cannot seem to book a flight in its main hub after 7:30pm. The fact that the final flight had not been properly cleaned and still had vomit on one of its seat belts summed up the level of service offered.

If these delays had happened in Europe I would have been entitled to €850 compensations in addition to meals and hotel. Would a SADC system of compensation work? Would it force airlines to improve their service delivery? It would not need to be set at European levels (though given local ticket prices, perhaps it should) but it would both help relieve the anger of passengers and also encourage airlines to fulfil the contract they enter into when they sell a ticket. A voucher for half a meal is not compensation, something SAX appears not to understand.

The one ray of hope for SAX was the professionalism of about three quarters of the staff I met. They were working hard and doing their best in really trying situations and still going the extra mile for the customer. They are very aware that their jobs depend on it. However, they are being betrayed by the other quarter who seem disinterested in their customers and a management that seems to be running the airline into the ground.

Would the world miss SAA and its little sister? Yes, it is an airline with a long pedigree and many people have happy memories. However, those memories seem to belong to an older generation and why the current generation of taxpayers should continue to subsidise passenger flights in a country with so many other needs is a question constantly being asked. If SAA and SAX were to cease operations it would lead to considerable short term job losses, but it would also open up vital routes to real competition and create sustainable opportunities. The whole of Southern Africa could benefit and, as to the question would the world miss SAA, it is doubtful if the world would even notice its demise.

"I had been told that the service on SAA has deteriorated a lot in recent years, so decided to try it for myself after a break of a few years .Due to my ticket type, I was unable to check in online. However, I was shown to a desk by a very pleasant concierge and checked in very quickly. Boarding of the flight seemed to be a bit chaotic with premium customers pushing and shoving to get to the head of the queue. Apart from that, it went smoothly. The one thing that did bug me, however, was the lack of attention to hand luggage. The airline advertises a strict hand luggage limit of 7kg, yet there were huge bags and backpacks which filled up the overhead locker space. This resulted in passengers having to look for space anywhere on the 'plane. We were  offered a good selection of drinks after take off - all complimentary, followed by the meal service. The meal was surprisingly good. The choice was the normal chicken; beef or pasta! I chose the beef and it was well cooked and tasty. There was a side salad which I didn't eat; a bread roll; dessert and cheese and biscuits followed by coffee, tea or licquers. The service was pleasant, friendly and efficient. I was fortunate enough to have some empty seats next to me, so was able to stretch out and sleep. Having said that, the economy seats had a reasonable amount of leg room.I have had far less leg room on some of the American carriers. The entertainment system worked well and there was a large choice of programmes covering all genres. Bottles of water were readily available as were extra blankets and pillows. The toilets were kept clean throughout the flight - a real bonus!! The breakfast was , again, very palatable. I had the sausage and egg option. My baggage arrived speedily - in fact - it was waiting on the floor next to the carousel by the time I arrived in the baggage hall. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement in service and would probably use SAA again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretH1036,Margaret H wrote a review Apr 2018,Margaret H,"London, United Kingdom",126 contributions,72 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r571833798-South_African_Airways-World.html,Pleasant surprise,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We were surprised how little legroom there was on a flight taking 18 hours. We had much more legroom on the 2 hour flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town on South African Airways than we did on the 18 hour flight from Washington, DC to Johannesburg. There were plenty of meals served. They also base their meal selections on a percentage basis, saying that they ""trust if you don't get your first choice the second one will be equally enjoyable."" Um, ok. The in-flight entertainment was poor. It was a struggle to find movies to watch (when you are on an 18-hour flight you have to find some way to fill the time) and any TV shows they had usually only had one episode. The music choices were terrible.

"Q. What international airline carrier and major national airplane carrier won’t accept credit cards (Australian) as payment direct on website or over the telephone to a sales team
member?
A. South African Airlines - horrendous

While travelling Africa I decided to fly Capetown to Livingston, Zambia and the Livingston to Johannesburg, on South African Airlines.
Booked the flight online, received the email confirmation stating tickets had been reserved but no payment was made. Then tried with 3 other credit cards and all three credit cards from different Australian major banks where rejected.

I then emailed South African Airlines (SAA) reservations to enquirer about tickets and to confirm tickets were still required. 2 weeks later, 3 emails later and still no response from SAA.

Finally my call (4th) to SAA was received, took 1hr21min to explain ticket situation and told tickets where to be renewed (at a greater expense than first reservation) got to the payment/transaction process of this telephone conversation and the sales staff said “your credit card can’t be accepted, we don’t accept international credit cards over the telephone ”. (Could of said/asked/told this at start of sales conversation).

Get to the airport the day we are to fly to Livingstone and the ticket prices jumped to $869usd from the original purchase reservation price of $356usd. Grrrr SAA

Come to check in and I hold Gold Status for Star Alliance, allowing 32kg for baggage allowance. The staff at Capetown and Livingstone tried to charge me 8kg over weight limit when my checked bag was 31kg and Gold Status allows 32kg on international flights. It took a trip out of security checking area to the customer sales team to clear this matter (I wasn’t charged extra $$$), but it took time and was a hassle for all involved.

Now it is time to fly and SAA won’t allow any mb devices to be used as inflight entertainment on flights. WTF. The mb phones are on flight mode, they don’t interfere with electronics of flights and SAA didn’t provide any inflight entertainment in the first place. !!

The business class hostess was the grumpiest, rudest and meanest air hostess I have ever come across (I’ve travelled 73 countries). She had Bulldog aggression, so much to say everything for her was a hassle - no customer service at all.

"We had just a short flight (under two hours) so I was surprised when they offered a hot meal. It wasn't very tasty but unlike US airlines at least they made the effort. Staff were friendly with one guy being downright jovial. The flight left on time and arrived early. Seats were OK for such a short flight. Note that you may have to take a bus to the plane so be prepared for inclement weather. It was pouring rain when we were trying to board. Luckily the stairs were covered, but we got pretty wet going from the bus to the plane.

"What's wrong with their cabin crew? The only smile I got when when disembarking. The aircraft was wonderful, food excellent, but served so grudgingly. The announcements say ""if we can do anything to make your flight more comfortable..."" but when I ask for a plate of cheese (which was on the business class menu) I got a lecture on how he was doing me a favour. The lady who was helping didn't say a single word to me until getting off. I think you need to send your staff on some customer service training. I would have rated this flight as excellent but for this one depressing aspect. Please try and cheer them up! You get happier service in economy on other airlines, and in business class people really try to be nice.

"If ever there was a stunning customer complaint about a flight that actually arrived, this must be it.
This is the letter I sent to SAA, on March 7. They can't even be bothered to reply. Not a word from them.

1. Where is the money?
I booked the 1st SAA Taipei-Bulaweyo flight through Orbitz, using either of these cards mentioned above.
The Orbitz website tells me that my card was rejected. No reservation was issued.
My bank immediately calls me and tells me that an attempt was made to wire 1500usd to 4 different airway-companies/agents
3 payments of around total 700usd did not make it through, because of an instant error code that was sent to the bank.
But, 1 payment of about 800usd was successfully sent and accepted by SAA.
Nothing was issued or refunded.
Orbitz has no record of anything related to this. No data about my payment or my existence.

I then call Orbitz to explain this to them, and they suggested I try again, this time letting the Orbitz operator do my booking. The exact same thing happened.
The Orbitz person tells me that my card was rejected. No reservation was issued.
My bank immediately calls me and tells me that another attempt was made to wire 1500usd to 4 different airway-companies/agents
3 payments of around total 700usd did not make it through, because of an error code that was sent to the bank.
1 payment of about 800usd was AGAIN successfully sent and accepted by SAA. Nothing was issued or refunded.
Orbitz has no record of anything related to this. No data about my payment or my existence.

SAA customer Service in SA could also not find any records, but had me on long-distance telephone hold for 2.5 hours. More money lost.

By now I have lost 1600+usd, which was my holiday spending money, and no way of getting it back from SAA, in time for my flight and holiday.

A third attempt was made to book this flight, and done successfully through another agent. Data above.
Now I have lost 1600usd and spent another 1600usd with barely any money left for this holiday.
Cancelling the holiday was not an option, due to many factors I will not list here.

2. What about my holiday?
With the very vague phone-promise from SAA to investigate the invisible money transfer, I left for Zimbabwe. In the end, SAA released the 2x 800usd, but 2 weeks later.
I spent half my holiday in Zimbabwe within a compound in Bulaweyo, with little or no money to go anywhere.
This was not the holiday I had in mind.

3. The flight(s) et al.

This next part actually involved my partner as well, with whom I flew together. I pushed him hard, convincing to spend more money on a quality SAA flight, rather than a much cheaper/faster Cathay. After all was done, he had no hope of getting any satisfaction from lodging a complaint with SAA. He has moved on, decided to avoid all SAA flights in the future. I do not share his opinion, and trust that SAA normally maintains better standards, and that this was an unlucky exception.

-Exit seats:
The Orbitz SAA tickets I initially paid for included exit seats all the way. 6 planes, 6 exit seats.
Those were now gone, meaning I would be in the cheapest seats in the 6 planes

Before my actual flight, I went to the EVA desk in Taipei, to ensure exit seats on the long haul once more.
I saw she booked those for me.
When I boarded in Hong Kong, no long haul exit seats were available to me.
The comment from SAA staff on the plane: ""Sorry, we changed planes last minute, so all seat numbers have been changed""
Needless to say, I was gutted, and gave up on exit seats altogether for the rest of the flights.

-Special meals:
I booked vegetarian meals all around, and confirmed this every step of the way. Naturally, it's on my ticket.
There was 1 meal outbound, and 1 meal inbound, leaving a veggie dinner and a veggie breakfast missing.
More about that later.

-Blankets in the cold:
On the way back from J-burg to Hong Kong the famously temperature-unstable Airbus dove into the lowest possible temperatures in my section of the plane.
While I was still eating the flight's first meal, watching a movie, the other people on the plane silently went on a blanket-collecting spree and left me none.
When I asked staff about that, they couldn't find any blankets anymore.

I was seated right under the extremely noisy main fan of my cabin section with no place to turn for relief.
Icy winds around 15 degrees blew straight onto me, for the better part of 12 hours. The other cabin sections were more bearable, 18-19 degrees, but even there people had even their heads completely covered by blankets
When I asked cabin staff again in despair, telling them I would file a complaint once back at the terminal in Hong Kong, the stewardess brought me a small plastic bottle with hot water, wrapped in some tissues.
""That should keep you warm"" , she said. It definitely did not.

A few hours later, when I became desperate, frozen to the bone, I tried to hide from the cold by fitting my 50yr old body on the floor, curled up under the knees of my 3 neighbor passengers, who had at least 6 blankets among them. They would not share their blankets, but allowed me to hide under their legs to shield me from the icy cold.
Naturally, SAA staff was quick to curse me for breaking the rules, forcing me to retake my icy seat once more.
Still polite, but ever so cold, I asked once more for a solution, leading the stewardess to ask the Captain to raise the temperatures, -something I was told all night by SAA staff was NOT possible on an Airbus.
I found the main cabin fan in my face finally switched off, but only for about 5 minutes, when it came on again and continued to torture me.

Finally, crew found a blanket for me, exactly 7 minutes before the night was over, when the lights went back on, and breakfast was served. That was 10 hours too late.
When I thought that a warm meal would help me defrost, I was in for more disappointment when there was no veggie meal, or otherwise anything warm to eat for me.
Chilled fruit, 2 portions, is what they had to offer! Everyone else had warm food.

4. Where is the nearest doctor?
By now I could not see clearly out of my eyes anymore.
Not only was I broken from lack of sleep, but my eyes were hurting from the many hours of none-stop icy breeze in my face, to a point of worry.
When I left the plane, I was clearly sick, and by the time I got home, I had to seek medical help to address a dual eye infection. More money lost.
Since I suffer from Giant Cell Arteritis, normally in remission, I had to start taking high-dose steroids again to avoid the return of the disease, with my immune system down from an eye infection and a serious cold.
Spent a week at home to recover.

5. Where is the SAA ground staff?

I had been patient and polite, all the way, despite all the discomfort and injustice.
When I got out of the plane in HK, I was frozen, sick, tired, eyes hurting, jet-lagged and very, very angry, as far as I am allowed to get angry without my desease causing me to have a stroke.

When I made my way to the airline terminal counters, there were no SAA staff to be found.
Inquiries led me to understand there were SAA staff, but on the other side of the airport.
With nobody responsible on site, there was nobody to assist, and I walked for 30 minutes to reach the other side, just to hear from other staff there that there are no SAA staff in the airport for another 10 hours.
Disillusioned, I walked back another 30 minutes to make my way to the EVA check-in counter for my last leg to Taiwan.
Then, EVA asked for my working permit for Taiwan, to allow me back into Taiwan without an exit ticket.

6. Where is my luggage?
I traveled very light, with only 1 small suitcase. Where EVA/SAA staff in Taipei had insisted I take my small 9.8KG suitcase with me as hand luggage to Zimbabwe, instead of checking it in, it was different on my return to Asia.
The SAA staff in J-Burg surprisingly forced me to check in that same case, same weight, on my way back to Taiwan. No discussion possible.
This was unexpected, and forced me to quickly remove my laptop while people behind me were pushing the queue at the counter.
Since I had prepared to take this as hand luggage, all my further belongings were in that case, including my work permit.
I now find myself in Hong Kong, trying to get to Taiwan, with my suit case/work permit now already in the cargo space of my EVA flight to Taiwan.
With the help of EVA ground staff now began a lengthy procedure of getting my bag out of cargo, a many step program that included having to leave transit and physically enter Hong Kong through Customs, do all kinds of stuff, pick up my bags from the conveyor belt and go through Customs again to return into transit.
I removed my permit and checked in my bags again.
It is not hard to imagine I did not need all that additional drama in my poor condition, getting worse by the hour.
Again, at no point was I unkind, impatient or otherwise displeasing in my manners, even though the SAA cabin crew was often irritated, impatient and almost unkind to passengers on both SAA long hauls.
---------------------------------
This so-called holiday has been a disaster from beginning to end.
With 1600usd stuck in SAA bank accounts for 2 weeks, I lost half my holidays in Zimbabwe due to a lack of funds.
Could not even bring any decent souvenirs for my family.
The flights, especially the return flight, was as horrible as they come, bar an actual crash in cold waters.

Consider the trouble I went through when I specifically chose SAA, paying 500usd more then Cathay Pacific fees, trusting to enjoy a much better flight.
That turned out to be a horrible miscalculation.

I trust you will fully compensate me for all this mayhem.
Since there is no way to compensate me for the additional loss of quality holiday time, surely this is not too much to expect.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backupped,backupped wrote a review Mar 2018,backupped,"Johannesburg, South Africa",7 contributions,3 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Hong Kong,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r569765883-South_African_Airways-World.html,"South African Airways.

"I was extremely happy to fly SAA.

The ground staff - check in and gate personnel were very professional, polite, helpful and efficient. They served with a smile and treated each passenger with importance and wished them a pleasant flight. This is a rarity these days, even with the overrated Emirates Airlines.

The cabin and flight crew were equally pleasant and served each passenger with a warm smile and good service.
Despite having financial problems, SAA did not skimp on drinks and meals. The meals were good too.

The flight(s) - we had to change flights in JNB, left and arrived right on schedule.

Highly recommend flying SAA in, to and from South Africa.

Even on international flights, we prefer to fly with Emirates; however, our first experience flying with South African Airways on our recent trip to Victoria Falls from Johannesburg return proved to be amazing and was far superior to all the airlines mentioned herein, including the overrated Emirates Airlines.

"This flight is in 2 parts, you fly to Senegal and stop over for an hour for refueling and then continue onto the USA. It’s a little inconvenient because people get off and on the plane and security comes on and searches everything... all at 2:30 am in the midst of 16 hours of travel. That’s just an inconvenience of this flight which you know going in. Planes are newer, entertainment is good. Food is decent although breakfast left me nauseated (I think just being tired).

On my last trip, there had been a snow storm on the east coast and flights to JFK (the JNB to JFK) had been canceled with lots of people redirected onto the JNB to IAD flight. So SAA goes and cancels all previously booked seats and reassigns them in the process of shuffling passengers. So if you booked a flight 6 months ago, specifically chose and paid for your seat, you’re out of luck. And you’re also now going to get your seat switched (read pack up, move yourself and even your overhead luggage) in the middle of the flight. The passengers next to me and I all asked the flight attendants about this at the initial gate, on the flight and again as we were being herded from place to place like cattle. They couldn’t be bothered. They change over crew in Senegal so they really couldn’t care less if you’re a little inconvenienced. And the new crew getting on just says you can always just get off in Senegal.

All that would have been required was some politeness, or some coordination. But instead all we got was rudeness. I realize that rerouting a lot of travelers is hard, but they just made it harder. I think next time I’ll take a different airline. It’s too long of a flight to deal with a rude crew.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg6684,Meg6684 wrote a review Mar 2018,Meg6684,"Baltimore, Maryland",7 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r568347265-South_African_Airways-World.html,Musical chairs at 2:30 AM,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My wife and I flew to and from S.A via JFK and had numerous flights within the country during a 4 week tour and were very impressed with their service. They had only two boarding lines: 1st Class and Economy and everyone boarded fast and efficently without having different boarding groups as we have in the states. The food service was exceptional. economy guests were sumptuous meals on REAL ceramic dishes with REAL silverware! Other airlines could take a cue on how to treat passangers in if not in 1st Class.

"Where to start? Well... the staff. Utterly rude, unhelpful and just useless. I cant put it any other way. The plane? Old, old and broken...

Let me start at the beginning......

Upon boarding our flight to Johannesburg, we got a little surprise, over the PA our pilot informed us that the plan had run out of blankets and water (it was a 1-hour wait to get more) so he will turn the heat up so that everyone is comfortable.... it was not comfortable. 10 hours in what felt like 40 degrees heat was not enjoyable for starters. Because we where leaving Perth at midnight (from Sydney its 3 hours difference) so my body already thought it was 3 am, I decided to try and get a little sleep, I did for about 2 hours, the bad thing was that i missed out of dinner service. I asked the host if I could please have something to eat, i got the reply ""dinner service is over"" again I asked her if I could have something to eat as I was very hungey and I was asleep druing the meal service, again I got ""meal service is over"" once again I had to ask for some food, I got an eye roll back and ""ill see what is left over"" form that remark I felt as if it was going to get binned left overs and half ate food, but what I got was the left over side portions of un-used salads, bread rolls and a cake. I couldn't do much about it as they are the ones serving the food. I went on to watch a movie on the seat back screen, it felt like I was using first generation LCD screens form the 1990s, the image was so grainy and poor that you couldn't even enjoy the movie let alone any other service on the console. Apart from the lack of food, blankets and water, the poor service and the most uncomfortable economy class seats, I have ever been in.. we got to Johannesburg in one peice, not looking forward to the flight home on South African Airways five weeks later.

When we boarded to fly home, out the plane was delayed for 3 hours (while we sat on the plane) as one of the toilets was not working. The maintainer staff could not fix it, and we had to fly with one less bathroom. while maintenance was repairing the toilet I had felt something moving under my seat, I reached down and found that a computer panel had fallen out of place (almost looked like it was ripped out) we had to wait another hour for the maintenance to fix what was a control piece. Not having very much confidence in South African Airways again, we did get home safley. And this time I made sure I was served dinner and breakfast!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/b6/67/32/ozi-puppy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willcapri,Will Capri wrote a review Mar 2018,Will Capri,"Sydney, Australia",198 contributions,76 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r568169439-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst airline in the skys,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Once again....we are SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED with our experience we had with SAA. One can truly understand why they are in such financial difficulty....because they do NOT deliver service of standard at all. One can only wonder....based on WHAT or WHO did they EVER got 'voted' as the 'Best airline in SA'...because they surely are NOT!!! They don't care about their personal and even worse...they don't care about their passengers at all. They just 'try' and make money....no matter what...even if it means giving their passengers the worse flight experiences ever. This is exactly what this review is about:
For some reason, SAA did not have a SAA labelled plane available on the flight from PE to CPT. It was just a white plane with no name on it. We have booked an exit seat, but ended up sitting in a different seat(because they apparently may do that according to their 'discretion'...(so why pre-book a seat at a cost at all then??) Anyway...once on the plane, one could see that they've tried to SQUEEZE as many people people into the plane as they could. The seats weren't even all the same look(some high back chairs and some even so low one could look into the neck of the person in front of you). The space between the seats were RIDICULOUSLY small...and we REALLY mean RIDICULOUSLY... Literally 27cm between the seat in front of you)...We know it for a fact, as we've measured it. The flight was so over-filled that people didn't have place to put their bags in overhead storage. A lady had to give her hand-bag(with all her personal belongings etc in) to the flight attendants, as she was not allowed to keep it with her...because ....and we quote the flight attendant, 'there is not enough space to put it at your feet mam'....Really???
Needless to say...everyone complaint about the flight...but the attendants honestly didn't care. Everyone got a snack....but whether you are in the front or back...you did not have a choice...you will will ONLY get what they have and apparently they didn't have an option, hence the reason why they didn't ask.
As we got to CPT airport we obviously wanted to get home as quickly as possible, as it was already 22:10 the evening.
We got to the carousel to fetch our bags....and here it comes....we waited almost 40 minutes for the bags to arrive.
Now...if that is what you want to experience when paying a lot of money for a plane ticket...then please go ahead and buy one again from South African Airways...but surely there are Greener pastures or even Orange ones or Pink and Blue one that you can truly rather consider...and you know what...they are NOT in financial difficulty like SAA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/17/d6/c8/freelancem.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreelanceGlobalMedia,Freelance Media wrote a review Mar 2018,Freelance Media,"Pretoria, South Africa",38 contributions,4 helpful votes,Port Elizabeth - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r567860573-South_African_Airways-World.html,DISAPPOINTING as always!!!,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On board the flight, I stood up to get some leg relief and rested against the arm of the seat for a while with pressure on my leg for support. Unprofessional air hostess screaming at people.

There was a lady at the plane entrance shouting for passengers in the aero bridge to queue on the right for row 16 upwards and the rest to the left. It was taking forever and passengers got irritated . The poor right queue had to descend from the aero bridge and walk to the tail of the plane to board the airplane.

"I travel frequently for business, usually with Emirates, so flying to New York with SAA gave me a good opportunity to compare airlines.

In most areas Emirates came out well on top. Their seats are softer and more comfortable, they have a better entertainment system with more options, their staff are better trained, and their airplanes are newer and felt cleaner.

However there were a few area where I felt SAA edged them out. Firstly the food (in my opinion) was far superior. The meals felt more personal, rather than the bulk produced food served by Emirates. There were also rolls served during the ""night"", rather than the small bags of pretzels offered by Emirates.

And Secondly, (perhaps obviously) the journey was a far shorter with SAA since it was a direct route rather than passing through Dubai.

"I love to travel. After 2 round trip flights, this year and last, to and from Johannesburg from JFK I have come to the conclusion that this airline is a good example of how little coach travelers are valued. who doesn't look to the movies to make the time pass? Last year, no video for a large portion of coach, on a 15 hour flight.  What did they tell us? ""A problem with the system"".  this time, the video system worked, but the quality was terrible.  poor image, often had to be restarted many times, outdated selection.  The legroom?  I am only 5'8"" and I had the seat on my knees when the person in front reclined.  If you are lucky enough to have an empty seat next to you, the middle arms cannot be moved fully out of the way.  On the most recent return flight, the temperature in the cabin was very hot.  After asking flight attendants if it could be cooled down, was told, ""that is the default"", ""we told the crew and nothing can be done"", and ""I'll let the captain know"".  It never cooled down.  the food?  about the worst I've ever had, particularly ironic because their inflight magazine had an article about how they consult with famous chefs and think their food is among the best.  over night - snacks are cheese sandwiches and crackers, water and orange juice.  The cheese sandwiches are a slice of orange cheese on a role with wilted lettuce, mayonnaise, and a slice of unripe tomato.  they were out of many beverage choices.The flight attendants appear at best uninterested, and often mildly hostile.  Although there was one who seemed to enjoy talking to two travelers in Afrikaans, frequently coming by to chat with them ignoring the rest of us.  They are quick to tell you to return to your seat when trying to stand and stretch a bit on the 15 hour flight.  And at least one seems to think it is ok to slather himself with aftershave that lingered for many minutes as he walked the aisle.  The bathrooms were not maintained at all overnight.  the smell was awful.Boarding is a free for all ,no attempt at any order or efficiency.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaher1,shaher1 wrote a review Mar 2018,shaher1,"Silver Spring, Maryland",47 contributions,16 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r566853002-South_African_Airways-World.html,Flights from JFK to Johannesburg and back- terrible,Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The airline is normal. They serve wine, spirits, sodas or juices about an hour after you are in the air.

Then the food was decent and about 3 courses with bread/butter. They come by with coffee and tea toward the end of food service.

Before take off, they ask you to store your blankets and pillows. The stewards come by to make sure you don't have the blanket on your lap (not allowed for safety reasons). Same thing happens on landing, so be aware, they will wake you up to have you remove the blanket.

"Flew South African Airways to Johannesburg from London on Airbus A330-200 economy. Comfortable 11 hour flight outbound the plane the was not full so extra space to spread out. Staff and service very helpful and obliging in manner through out the flight.
The food and drink were adequate with water and fruit juice during lights out period during the night section of the flight.
The only down side the in-flight entertainment is not as comprehensive as big long haul airlines and equipment is older and TV lacks sharpness. Minor niggle but functional and keeps you entertained.
We were delayed for 3 1/2 hours on Durban to Port Elizabeth SA 1348 flight and although I had a ticket was put on stand by on check in only got boarding ticket and seat for he flight one hour before departure.

"This review cover the outward and return journeys from Durban via Johannesburg and return - I paid R37.500 for my ticket supposedly in business class - first problem was at check in Durban - due to SAA's mismanagement over many years they have canceled probably 50% of local flights - there were no suitable SAA connecting flights so I was booked Mango who only have economy class - I wanted to check my bags priority through to Hong Kong - no can do I was told - eventually after some negotiation with the manager I was given an SAA tag for Mango to use - as it was a businesses class booking I wanted to use the lounge - no can do I was told even though I also hold a Gold Star Alliance card (not with SAA) - again eventually I was allowed access - the flight onto Hong Kong was good - food, service and extras were ok - coming back no such luck - menu was wrong or was it the food that was loaded? pasta turned out to be risotto - the cheese in my fridge is better - service tacky - then - oh no! - my seat ceased to function halfway to making the lay flat bed  - a handy captain manged to get it working after some delay but try as he may the entertainment system in both cabins was dead and buried - not a squeak from start to finish - I slept uneasy for the passengers at the back staring into space for 13+ hours - and then there was the Mango horror show to follow - same story with priority baggage tags and lounge access - the gate opened 10 mins late - we were made to wait in a steamy bridge for another 10 mins and then eventually when all were on board and seated we were informed (sorry about this he said) that the plane was not technically allowed to fly because of a malfunction / lack of a deicing system - he phoned home for advice - no go so up we all got and changed planes - the cabin attendant clearly said gate C6 which is at the opposite end of domestic departures but this was wrong as it was D6 two gates away - more delays whilst everyone found the right gate - we left 90+ minutes late - a horrific end to a nightmare journey - at this rate even the most supportive customers will be jumping  ship if you get my drift.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/7e/36/88/gday1044.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GDay1044,GDay1044 wrote a review Mar 2018,GDay1044,"Durban, South Africa",1106 contributions,400 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Hong Kong,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r565310700-South_African_Airways-World.html,Going backwards again,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An excellent flight really but the breakfast was not to my liking and below par. We had the extra leg room seats by the exit doors which always improves ones comfort. Pity about other passengers hanging around our seats waiting for the loo ! Others also insisted crossing our path in between our seats and the bulkhead. Not a lot of room for that when you've got your legs outstretched being the idea of buying the extra leg room seats !! Then we land, only to find our 2nd brand new case damaged - ie, ripped and torn sides, handle smashed and our locked padlock removed/missing. Not a happy landing at 6.35am after 11.5 hour flight.

"South African Airways is the worst airline I have ever traveled.  I'm sure there are worse but I have not experienced them. My outbound flight from JFK was long especially since the video screen was not working.  I asked three times for someone to check it but nothing was done.  However; the return flight (15 hours) from Johannesburg to JFK was excruciating!  Not only did my video not work, I got into an argument with a flight attendant over the video not working. She did not understand my frustration when she offered to move me to another seat.  It was in the middle of the flight.  Everyone was sleeping. I am nearly six feet tall and I had a fractured ankle. How could she move me to a different seat with no guarantee that the new seat's video would work?  The video not working was not the biggest problem.  This stewardess would not give up arguing with me.  I told her to go away.  Later in the flight she returned with her supervisor to report me.  I reiterated my complaint and explained that she did not understand me.  She and her supervisor continued to argue with me.  I proceeded to tell her supervisor that on this 15-hour flight I was never offered water and I was not allowed to use the lavatory two feet from my seat.  I had to go ask a stewardess when we boarded for a small bottle of water.  She said it was reserved for the premium class.  I was sitting in the bulk head seat in the middle of the plane. I had two fractured bones in my ankle and was wearing a medical walking boot. The lavatory for economy class was at the back of the plane.  There was a lavatory two feet from my seat but the stewardess, Carol Meyer, would not allow me to use it.  She said it was reserved for the premier passengers only.  I begged her and showed her I had a broken ankle.  She ignored my plea and waved her hand to go to the back of the plane.  The entire 15-hour flight, both lavatories - two feet from my seat were locked.  I believe I was ""blackballed"" by all the stewardesses half way through the flight.  They would walk by without offering me a sandwich or a beverage. About 1 1/2 hours before we landed at JFK, they brought breakfast.  I had to ""flag down"" someone for my breakfast.  After about 45 minutes, with a dirty try on my lap, they returned and offered tea or coffee.  Again, no water. Several minutes later, someone finally came to collect the trash.  For a 15-hour flight, they collected the trash twice!!!!!  I felt as though I was being treated like cattle.  Totally unacceptable and terribly poor customer service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/30/8c/41/bunny0016.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunny0016,Bunny0016 wrote a review Mar 2018,Bunny0016,"Orange County, California",175 contributions,39 helpful votes,New York City - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r565155480-South_African_Airways-World.html,I will never fly South African Airways again!,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If an airline advertises itself as having a personalised onboard entertainment system then it is reasonable to expect that they mean that it is functional. This is simply not the case. On the last three  NYC/Johannesburg trips our flight has been marred by arguments and pleadings with various stewards/esses to reboot the system, move us to a seat where the system works etc. On the most recent flight we had four seats between the two of us and eventually only one system was operational, and that only intermittently. As someone who does not sleep at all I am entirely reliant on movies to entertain me for 16-odd hours. Dewalt and another charming steward who appeared to have some authority were interested in our predicament but the stewardesses I had earlier approached seemed annoyed by my intrusion into their personal time and resented my annoyance at the non-functioning entertainment system - not interested at all.

"We flew both ways on SAA and did two internal flights.  The first strange thing is that you get more leg room on domestic flights than international. The standard of flying, landing etc. is exemplary but there crew vary a lot. An extremely sullen hostess could not even be bothered to get up when we were leaving the plane, never mind wish us a good day! My wife's gluten free meals were fairly inedible.  The normal food was not great. Wine is good as you would expect. In flight entertainment was poor.  The choice of films is not too bad but the audio was too quiet to be audible with their headphones. At the gate, they let the passengers through security on to the ramp and then kept everybody waiting about 30 minutes with nowhere to sit while they loaded food on the plane.  Totally stupid and very poor communication.  I know this airline is struggling financially and it shows in that they don't even fill an A330 in summer in either direction.

"The SAA pilots are terrific in terms of competence and pride in the airline.  It is always a pleasure to hear them on the intercom.  However, once you get into the cabin there is often an air of indifference.  Service levels differ from good to just average.  Add this to the completely shambolic handling of passengers through immigration, both inbound and outbound, at O R Tambo where total indifference abounds, it makes travelling in South Africa a lot less pleasant than many other airports.

"On September, 2017, I bought three tickets from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg for me, my girlfriend and her godson (12 years old).

I informed, on the same day that I bought such tickets, that there was a little error in the passenger name, and I asked what would be the procedure in this case.

It was a material and irrelevant error, I just had written his middle name with a plus “r”.

In the e-mail dated 26 September 2017 sent by the Reservations Service Recovery team as described herein, they confirmed that the error in the name would not be a problem and also informed the occurance of a schedule change on our flight, as transcribed below:

“Kindly be advised that we have endorsed on the system for the airport to allow passenger to board.
Please note that there has been a schedule change on your flight from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg.”

Unfortunatelly, on flight’s day when I tried to do the kid's check in at the airport, I was informed that his ticket was cancelled, although his seat was still booked in the system. We know that because I did my check in and my girlfriend's check in online one day before the flight and kid's seat was there.

South African employee informed us that his ticket was cancelled, because the name was wrong and the company policy sets forth that the ticket must be automatically cancelled.

However, I did not receive any e-mail about such cancellation. And also we confirmed five months ago with the company if the error in kid’s name would represent a problem and the answer was NO, as I mentioned above.

The airline employee at the airport said that the ticket was cancelled and refunded and she could not do anything about it.

The wrong information of South African Airways employee, and the lack of cancelation notice cost us 3.281,89 rands, almost four times more than the ticket that I originally paid for the kid to travel with us.

I still want to understand why his ticket was cancelled and once cancelled why I did not receive a notice about it.

We were on vacations and we booked two days in Sun City Hotel. So I did not have other choice than buy another ticket to the kid by a huge price.

I look foward to their return. The ticket was arbitrarily cancelled. We were badlly guided by South African's team regarding the error in the kids name and the cancelation of his ticket. It cost us more 2.465,80 rands.

I really expect to have such value fully refunded. It is our first flight with your company and we are very disappointed with the way that we have been treated by their employees since the beginning.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/2f/d6/46/fabricio-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabriciom765,Fabricio M wrote a review Feb 2018,Fabricio M,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",851 contributions,65 helpful votes,Port Elizabeth - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r563160797-South_African_Airways-World.html,Cancellation without previous notice cost us a fortune,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew on the 1050 SA40 flight.

Jo'berg airport is busy, modern and well equipped. I couldn’t understand why so many people were late and asked to be let through to the front of the security queue.

However, Gate A06 was not a long walk, has toilets very close and a coffee bar.

Perfect.

Nice Airbus 300. Two, four and two.

Plenty of premium economy seats, much room in economy.

The plane was delightfully clean and looked relatively new. Who knows?, certainly not me.

All four of us commented on how lovely the colours were, muted browns, beige with a few other stripes thrown in. It took us all by surprise.

The IFE looked fairly new, it didn’t work on this short flight but looked nice.

The trays did three things. Fold down once, unfold again and then pull out to you, three positions and a pen rest!
Independent of that was a cup or glass holder.

The seats reclined a long way, there was plenty of legroom. The headrests could be raised and the wings folded out to rest one's head against.

Brilliant.

And then they handed out cheese filled croissants and fresh fruit. On a one and a half hour flight! Bonus.

Then tea or coffee, then bottles of water and the OMG YES, THEN ALCOHOL, FREE.

I couldn’t believe it. 187ml of lovely red wine later for free and we were descending.

Staff were excellent, friendly and helpful.

I would highly recommend this airline.

The food was great and very generous portions. Flights left on time.

Entertainment system is old. Did not work in both directions except for the map which I enjoyed. But this did not bother me.

"I went with South African to Jonesburg from Heathrow ready for a safari last Easter for 3 weeks. We decided to go with South African, because it was the one that fitted our time window the best. A pretty good flight it was overnight so we got dinner pretty early on so people could sleep which was good, but it didn't stop there they brought drinks through all night for people who don't sleep on planes like my self. A really comfy seat more than happy sitting in it for a lot of the flight, also a really good atmosphere on board and staff really friendly. The entertainment was faultless really good films to keep you occupied for a long flight which is why it went really quick. The toilets were really clean and nothing wrong with them.

"Plenty of legroom, flight took off and landed on time and cabin crew were attentive during the flight. In addition the meals were more than acceptable.
When travelling long haul, apart from arriving safely and on time, all I want is a comfy seat and an attentive cabin crew and both of these were provided by SAA.
The other reason for choosing this airline was that by using Johannesburg as a hub instead of an alternative, it made for a much more pleasant experience. Since visiting Johannesburg airport for the first time in 2002 it has improved immensely and when you have several hours to ‘kill’ it makes for a much better alternative to some of the other African options.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/ad/e7/bb/john-e.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275JohnE275,John E wrote a review Feb 2018,John E,"Llanelli, United Kingdom",62 contributions,66 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r560969230-South_African_Airways-World.html,Good value,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A trip to South Africa and the obvious choice of carriers is the local one. That way we can link all the flights together and it will all be plane sailing (pun intended). Sadly not. Let’s start with the flight out... it was on a Airbus 330, which is a bit small for a 9 hour flight, but it still managed 8 seats across! Seat A being next to seat C, same with H & J, seats B & I missing. The leg room is ok for a long haul flight, but not overly generous. The entertainment system plays films, and games, or at least should, mine was broken completely and I heard other passengers complaining of the same... not good for a 9 hour flight. The choice of films is not vast but included many “classics”. If you want to watch a recent block buster you will be disappointed. Also the entertainment system was not turned on until after takeoff and we had reached cruise altitude and shut off before descent, taking an hour out the schedule. The food was ok, but they had limited choice of options, so by the time the last few were served it was a case of being thankful for any food! There were no individual air nozzles so you had the temperature as it was, which on our flight was too cold for comfort, we did get a blanket and pillow. The seats after 9 hours were not good, and for the slightest turbulence the seatbelt sign went on, which meant no tea or coffee for health and safety reasons! We arrived at Jo’burg and thought our bags would be transferred to our onward flight as the tickets said it was all with South African Airlines, but no we had to retrieve our bags and recheck-in, only now did we discover that our connecting flight with a SA flight number was actually South African Express and we were sent to a different checkin. The baggage porters, expecting people to be bewildered when turned away from the SAA desk now pounce on you, snatch your bags, march you to SA Express, then demand R200 per porter (about £13)  for the privilege.... welcome to your first sanctioned mugging in SA. Would I travel with SAA again.... only if there was no better option.... but since the return flight is today I may well be posting a sequel to this sorry tale tomorrow!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogers-Rambles,Rogers-Rambles wrote a review Feb 2018,Rogers-Rambles,"England, United Kingdom",234 contributions,64 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r560959793-South_African_Airways-World.html,Not the worlds favourite airline!,Date of travel: February 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After flying on a very bad SAA flight from Frankfurt, I was not too happy continuing with SAA, even on a short flight to Durban, but what a difference in attitude, smile, helpfullness and even cleanness of the cabin.
Here we were wlecomed with a big smile, from a guy (I think) called Michael, who had been with SAA for 37 years. He smiled and made people feel good, from the moment they stepped into the cabin, till we stepped off.
There was a small snack meal, which was miles better class thatn the one served on the longhaul, and even the seats was better in the smaller Airbus.
Maybe SAA should concentrate on the shorter flights, and leave the longhauls to the airlines, who appreciate their guests.

"I travel around the world monthly, and it had been a while since I used SAA, due to a poor experiance before, but in all fairness, everyone deserves a 2nd chance. That was a mistake, and there is not going to be a 3rd.
The seats in this Airbus 340-600 was old worn, and very very dirty. The food was not even what other airlines would serve on ecconomy, and to top it all up, the staff was not present and didn't care about their guests.
The entertainment was so poor, half the screens not working, and they felt like they were covered in something, or hadn't been cleaned for months.

"Just a warning ... I was recently on a flight from Maputo to Johannesburg.  At check-in, I specifically asked about my carry-on which is my camera case with my professional equipment.  I have always been allowed to take it onboard.  The case is smaller than the cases most people bring on-board.  As I was getting on the plane, the flight attendant stopped me and said I couldn't take it on the plane.  I would have to gate check it.  I tried to explain, but she refused to listen and told me check it or you are not getting on board.  After over 2 weeks in Africa of doing humanitarian work, I wanted to get home to see my family.  The flight attendant was beyond rude about it, and could not tell me where I would collect my bag.  As we were landing, I and several other passengers were told we could get it from the transfer area so we wouldn't have to go out of immigrations.  Well, this was wrong.  After 30 minutes, they finally figured out our bags were in the baggage area.  We went to go claim them but they were now with SA office.  I was in a rush cause now I had to go back out and back through immigration and security which in Johannesburg can take 10 minutes or 60 minutes depending on the day.  My lock was still on my camera case so I didn't think to check it.  I got home and I was prepping my case for the next trip and I open it up my camera is missing along with lens and a few other items.  $2,000 worth of equipment stolen.  SA Airways is making it just about impossible for me to make a claim.  They are telling me I need to fill out a police report in South Africa which they KNOW is not feasible.  I now have to fill out the claim and hope they at least process it so I can get my insurance to pay for the lost equipment.  This was not isolated ... during that trip several members of our party had stuff stolen from their bags from a laptop to computer cords to many other items.  I had seen a report that theft was high in JNB, but as many of 5 people reported stuff stolen on this trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/22/f2/bf/79/hobbesey.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hobbesey,Hobbesey wrote a review Feb 2018,Hobbesey,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",312 contributions,106 helpful votes,Maputo - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r560699271-South_African_Airways-World.html,Be Wary Theft Is Still High in Johannesburg Even with TSA Locks,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food was horrible - all meals had curry in them. It is the only direct flight from JFK to JHB. My tv plug did not work and I had to switch seats.

"Over the past 20 years I have flown a huge amount of miles on SAA (and most other major airlines around the world), but have to say the service on SAA has deteriorated and each time I hope to see some kind of change (surprisingly, flying to Munich was probably one of the best flights I have had with SAA in the past few years, but then back to reality on the flight home and thoughts of, “why did I do this to myself”).

As a so called priority customer (with life time platinum), you would expect to be greeted or see some level of appreciation, I was not acknowledged at all, the staff serving did not greet any of the passengers (no hello or friendly approach, just what would you like), certain seats in economy are smaller than the standard size which makes them extremely uncomfortable (with a tray table in the arm rest and airbag on the seat belt). The meals are seriously horrible (no flavor or taste to them), as such I hardly ate on the flight. Inflight entertainment did not work, and was rebooted (still had issues), so nothing to watch. The flight was late on arrival, which I have got used to by now.

As much as I would like to support SAA, as far as I can, I really have a hard time convincing myself to fly with them (when I have options).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/21/ba/c1/b9/trevorburchell.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorBurchell,TrevorBurchell wrote a review Feb 2018,TrevorBurchell,"Pretoria, South Africa",404 contributions,117 helpful votes,Munich - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r559136902-South_African_Airways-World.html,Same old experience ,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This was actually a really good flight. I never flew with South African Airways before so I didn't knew what to expect at all. We were flying with the A340-600 which is a very beautiful aircraft however the interior is a little bit out of date. The chairs are quite comfortable but old. It doesn't really bothers me actually because you still have everything you need on a long flight like this. The service was really great. That has to do with the food they serve but especially with the personal who serves it. They were really friendly and extremely polite. I was drinking wine the whole flight and the glass was almost never empty till I asked the purser that it was enough. The quality of the food was also really good.

"Living in SA, one gets accustomed to people slagging off state owned companies, and usually for good reason. South African Airways also gets stick for leaning heavily on public funding and in spite of this benefit, failing to make a profit. That said though, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this flight home from Maputo. It's only an hour and a quarter in the air but still enough to give one a good idea of the quality of service on offer. Unlike Kalula (which screws every cent out of passengers) there was this stuff on board called food. And would you believe it was free! And there was liquid too. Also free. Whatever will they think of next. On so short a flight, I wouldn't normally care too much about refreshments, but I reckon it was a real pleasure going back to SAA. The flight itself was as smooth as silk in what seemed like an almost new A300. The pilot (a woman) delivered us to our destination with barely a ripple of turbulence. The on board stewardesses worked the cabin with ready smiles. Fantastic. Pity that the Home Affairs staff at Johannesburg's Immigration let the side down so badly. As residents we've been coming in and out of the country for 15 years without difficulty. This time, I had the misfortune of encountering an obnoxious woman who treated me like a criminal because I was not carrying a 15 year old letter from Home Affairs confirming my residency. When I asked (twice) to see DHA guidance on this matter she refused to show it. Had she been able to read, she would have seen the Resident stamp in my passport. Had she been able to think, she would have realised that my ID would not have been issued had I not been a resident. Instead, and without a word of explanation, she insisted on finger printing all fingers and thumbs.

"I am a nervous flyer so, I was quite worried about this midnight 10 hour flight from Perth. To my surprise, even though we boarded at 12pm, once up in the air we were served a full dinner. Once that was all packed away I went to sleep through most of the rest of the flight. The communication from the captain was great, service was superb and available all night. The flight was completely smooth. Inflight entertainment system was dysfunctional but I got a bit of screen time at breakfast. When we arrived in Joburg it was early morning and I felt like it hadn't been a long distance flight. On the way back it was 9 hours, same awesome service and amazingly smooth. Unfortunately the inflight system that my husband had was totally broken and he didn't sleep so he had nine and half hours of looking at the back of his seat.

"South African Airways or SAA has lost the plot but not the pilot. In the cockpit are some of the very best pilots I have flown with but the cabin crew leave much to be desired. The food on board is adequate and the presentation is fine but the cabin crew, with limited exceptions, are unfriendly, inefficient and unprofessional. I for one, am tired of feeling like I have to apologize for being a passenger.  It starts at the Check-In, continues at the airport lounge reception and is then multiplied in the air. On board live announcements are incoherent. Service with a smile? No, a grunt is more likely. Seldom are pre-set out drinks and snacks available in the galley during the flight. One has to interrupt the book-reading attendant with a specific request for what you don't know they have so that it can be, reluctantly retrieved! In flight, the incessent and loud personal chatter amongst the crew in the galley makes sleeping in the back 5 rows a challenge. Then there is the temperature!!! I am guessing but on average it must be in the low teens. The objective seems to be to keep you in your seat and  under the blanket so as not to bother the crew for service. All in all, not a happy experience. There is the odd shinning exceptions who provide real service. These are few but they all have something in common ~ they are senior in age and experience, not young and arrogant.

"My son and I flew SAA from New York to Johannesburg and then from Johannesburg to Manzini, Swaziland on December 23/24, 2017 and returned through the same airports on January 13, 2018. It’s the longest flight I’ve experienced. I was a little apprehensive prior to the flight, but I ended up being very pleased with our experience! The flight was pleasant, the planes were all clean and stocked with blankets, pillows, etc for the long flights and our needs were taken care of. I have Celiac Disease and had ordered gluten free meals prior to our travel. It was an easy process and the meals were delicious! They were lacking dessert (Snickers bars are GF and my son wouldn’t share! 😜). The only small “complaint” was there were no gluten free options available for snacks during the flight... just meal times.

"On my return leg from a business conference i had a quick transit through Johannesburg to Windhoek.  I have my ticket and i have checked into my flight online as well.  I get to the boarding gate and they tell me that someone has changed my ticket to a later flight.  I was furious, but go to the ticket desk to take it up with SAA and this lady has no interest in my appeal.  She simply tells me that it was LATAM (airline they contracted for flight) whom changed my ticket and i should take it up with them.

Shame on you South African airways. My family and I left TWO seperate items on TWO seperate flights and both are nowhere to be found despite bringing it to your attention immediately!! Not sure what your company policy on ethics is but perhaps it requires a refresher?  So very disappointed that both items are gone. Obviously I wish that we’d been more diligent but after a long flight home we were tired. You would hope that the staff would have enough integrity to return items that were innocently left behind. We’ve now been advised to contact the South African police department. Such an unfortunate measure but obviously a necessary one.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691carynm,Caryn M wrote a review Jan 2018,Caryn M,"Mulgrave, Australia",1 contribution,,Cape Town Central - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r557106685-South_African_Airways-World.html,Disgusted,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I fly frequently around the world on long haul aircraft and on my visit to South Africa decided to fly with South African Airways
Business class. My wife, son and his GF accompanied us, so our party was 4

The service and more importantly the attitude was appalling, I might add we are pretty easy folk and don’t complain. The food was indifferent and slow.

I can honestly say I’ve had better food on a decent 1st line economy class airline than this lot.

The biggest issue was the staff attitude, whether this is that we are not used to the South African manner of addressing people or we just don’t like indifference and arrogance I’ll let you judge.

Never ever will I fly this airline again, if I had to fly to South Africa I would probably go Air Mauritius where they at least are happy to share their day with you.

"My wife and I traveled from Munich to Johannesburg, and since it is a long night flight we bought tickets in business class in order to have flat beds. The plane was a fairly worn A340. We were kindly received on board and shortly after departure they served dinner. The first dish was a shrimp dish. It was ice cold and looked sad. The green leaves were more than sloppy and I think the food was made the day before in Johannesburg and brought along for the whole trip. My main course was chicken which tasted ok and the dessert was excellent.
After dinner we wanted to sleep and tried to drive the seat down to flat bed position, but one seat was broken and one of us had to sit up all night.

"We flew Air Seychelles 🇸🇨 from Mumbai to Johannesburg.
After a long haul flight, one wishes to get onto their connecting fight and get home.
We arrived in Johannesburg, went through customs.. Only to get stopped at check in where the incompetent man behind the counter deliberately delayed us stating that we were only allowed one check in bag when our electronic ticket clearly said ""2 pieces"". We literally ran from international to domestic with 5 minutes after boarding time, the man said we cannot board our flight and as we walked away we noticed him letting through 3 white males.

We called for the supervisor as we had now missed our flight.. Only to be told the airline had overbooked the fight.

"So we flew SAA to JFK return from Johannesburg in South Africa.  When an airline starts to become problematic when dealing with them is guaranteed to cause extra stress, especially when one is away from home.  So while at our hotel in New York, I decided to go on line to confirm our return flights. (And to select seats).  Every time I tried to get on-line, I got the, ""Website unavailable"" message, obviously some maintenance issue.  So I found them on Facebook and indicated what I wanted to do and the response was to contact their number in the USA which was supplied.  So I called the number and waited an inordinate amount of time until a lady called Nyra answered.  She was a consumate professional, she explained that she was in Fort Lauderdale and while she was sympathetic, her computer system did not allow her to allocate seats. (So why did they suggest this route one might ask).  At this stage,instead of being out enjoying NYC, I was in my hotel room trying to arrange seating for the return flight.  I got a return message on Facebook later in the day offering to help.  However, they obviously got their website up and running, and we managed to book seats for the return flight.We boarded the plane and took our seats, and sat and waited.  Eventually the announcement came about some fueling issue and we were told it was going to take some time to rectify. (This I worked out to be 71 minutes).  But eventually we were cleared  and departed.  Once in the air, there was an announcement about the infotainment system in economy being problematic and were told it would be a 20 minute exercise to re-boot it.  I also discovered that my seat-back was not locking and if I leaned back, it went into recline mode.  Eventually it became apparent that my infotainment screen was not functional so I elected to read.  I discussed this with a cabin attendant who offered to move us, but as we were settled and had our luggage stowed away, I declined.  On the outbound flight from Johannesburg the previous week, the catering was unexpectedly good, but on this flight it was exactly the opposite.  The options were limited, (I ordered the curry it was dry) and my companion ordered the vegetarian option, which was also substandard.  Breakfast was even worse, if such a thing could be imagined.  The two choices (Fritatta with broccoli where the broccoli was not in evidence in any way.) and a waffle which was patently pathetic to be blunt.  The only thing which was reasonable was the coffee.  The other interesting thing was all of the announcements ran behind the actions. We were already being served when we were told what was of offer.All in all, what the state of the aircraft on both recent flights tells me that the maintenance is sub-standard, and for a company with a (previous)good reputation this is worrying.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/f6/d5/0d/silliusmillius53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silliusmillius53,Roger Paul M wrote a review Jan 2018,Roger Paul M,"Johannesburg, South Africa",119 contributions,32 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r554961040-South_African_Airways-World.html,General experience wish leave you uneasy,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Being a journalist shooting TV news around the globe, I have done a fair bit of air travel. And I have to say that SAA has been one of my preferred carriers, although, it has been reportedly going down in recent years.  Knowing this was going to be a long flight we chose seats by the over wing exit on this aircraft (Airbus 340 - 600) for the extra legroom. Well firstly I found the crew were very helpful and pleasant.  The flight had it's plusses and minuses, I will start with the plusses.  The catering on outbound flights from Johannesburg was better than I expected and the food options were well considered, having a fish option was a bonus for my companion as she is a pescatarian.  And while it not fine dining, the food was quite palatable. The morning breakfast offerings were also good and between the two of us we fared quite well. On the minus side, firstly I always find bread on flights somewhat un-appetizing and as for the croissants (Not a term I would use for this confection as presented) well, perhaps the less said the better.  On the trip the infotainment system was troublesome, my partners screen didn't work at all and mine was so problematic, I eventually gave up. I read my book.All in all it wasn't a bad flight,I have had far worse. The flight on the way back is an example.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/f6/d5/0d/silliusmillius53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silliusmillius53,Roger Paul M wrote a review Jan 2018,Roger Paul M,"Johannesburg, South Africa",119 contributions,32 helpful votes,Johannesburg - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r554956638-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Nice flight, surprisingly good airline food",Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We tend to use major international airlines but we got a good deal on SAA so we thought we would give it a go. Ground service was excellent, particularly at OR Tambo when we changed planes. The surprising thing was the amount of legroom on the plane, almost too much, to reach the pocket in the back of the seat in front you had to unbuckle and stand up! The downside of this is that you had no table in front of you and no seat back entertainment, these were stashed in the armrests so the seats were narrower than most business class seats.

"Ok so this was our first time flying with South African airways and I do think it would be my last .

Bad Plane : The aircraft was old , the seats were rock hard and the entertainment systems didn’t work flying to SA and coming back to Sweden . Luckily it was a overnight flight and I had some Netflix saved on my phone and the rest of the way tried to sleep .

Good Service : I have been flying a lot these last couple of years with a lot of different airlines . The service we received there and back was of the best services I have had . Always had a smile on their faces and the service was quick !!!! Also if you asked for something extra it didn’t seem like a big issue like it is with other airlines . Some of the bigger/better airlines air hosts tends to be a bit ignorant and unfriendly .

In a nutshell: what they lacked of in the plane they made up with good service .

My issues are - My wife was not allowed take her carry-on luggage into the flight, only her hand bag was allowed. My question: what is allowed into SAA flight. Handbag plus carry-on luggage or either handbag or carry-on luggage. There is no in-flight entertainment on flight 363 and it was a boring flight for my kids",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/d7/b5/42/nnate-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nnatea2018,Nnate A wrote a review Jan 2018,Nnate A,"Johannesburg, South Africa",10 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r553927722-South_African_Airways-World.html,Cape Town flight,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We travel to South Africa twice a year, in Business Class, usually with South African Airways.The first leg of our return journey to the UK, Cape Town to Johannesburg, was brilliant. First class food, wine and service.
Surprisingly, in Johannesburg, even the security and passport queues for our onward flight to London were small and fast moving.
We arrived at the South African Airways lounge to find there were no vacant seats.
When we boarded the aircraft there were two lines for pre-boarding document checks, and later two lines for boarding. At neither was priority boarding being put into practice and long queues were encountered.
On board, the seats were uncomfortable, and back breaking when put into the horizontal sleeping position. The ""mattress"" provided was thin and completely ineffective.
The crew, as is common on overnight flights, were not really interested in providing good service. The food was poor and the cheese course consisted of three thin slices of dried up cheese. Food was served on trays, with no table cloth and thin paper napkins. Certainly not up to any Business Class flight I have been on previously.
For breakfast, I chose to have the stale cornflakes and ""dish-washer"" coffee (image attached).
Sleep was impossible with crew back and forth for much of the time, bumping into seats and leaving the curtains open.
There was no opportunity, that I could find, on the SAA website to submit customer comments.
Whatever happened to ""premium travel"" in Business Class?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RB777,RB777 wrote a review Jan 2018,RB777,"Carmarthen, United Kingdom",55 contributions,18 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r553920289-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worse flight ever with SAA,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is the first time we decided to fly business class locally as we had already spent 41 hours travelling and were completely knackered. We had the benefit of using the airline lounge which was clean and had everything you need from food and beverages to a smoking lounge.

I am not that impressed with the actual business class section on the flight and directly comparing this with other local flights who do not have a business class section. I found the seats not much different to local economy class.
The onboard service was however excellent with really great staff so no complaints there.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/69/51/29/cheryl-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996cherylg,Cheryl G wrote a review Jan 2018,Cheryl G,"Durban, South Africa",268 contributions,63 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Durban,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r553885044-South_African_Airways-World.html,no problems,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown all over the world on all kinds of airlines from the cheapos like Ryan Air to the deluxe Singapore Air but I have never flown on a worse airline.  I'll start with what they did right.  They loaded the back rows 1st.  There were small amenity kits & headphones were free.  That's it.  The voices on the video were scrambled & they needed to reboot the system.  It was 2 hours before they bothered.  Neither of ours worked even then but many others did start working.  The food was edible but not much above that.  We didn't have the curry chicken because we don't like curry.  However the ""beef stew"" also had curry.  There was no mention of that in the announcement.  Thankfully it was fairly light.  The veggie lasagne had some type of white sauce like an alfredo.  It was ok but not lasagne.  The b'fast egg frittata was good but the chicken sausage was mealy like the British bangers.  However both the food & the video could be overlooked.  What couldn't be ignored was the abysmal service.  Basically there was none.  They fed us 1 meal right after we took off & another 2 hours before we landed.  The flight was ALMOST 15 HOURS.  I've had more food on every 6 hour transatlantic flight to Europe & the transpacific flights to HI & Asia.  They never came thru the cabin with water or juice during the night.  They never came thru & picked up trash.  You could go to the back & pick up stuff (which we did) but no one announced that option.  Thankfully we had packed some snacks & we ended up eating most of them.  One of our party happened to see sandwiches sitting in the galley & asked if he could have some.  However they were on the same par as the meals.  The chicken curry wasn't too bad (altho it tasted like deviled ham) but the veggie spread was just nasty.  Other items of annoyance were you weren't allowed to have a blanket in your lap during take off or landing. The plane was very cold.  Luckily we were leaving from NYC in Jan so had our coats.  Most of the aisle seats weren't allowed to put a bag under the seat in front of it. There were no USB ports. None of the flight attendants were especially friendly.  They all seemed to be more interested in standing in the galley talking to each other or sleeping in their quarters.  However 1 was just barely civil.  He was Sixollie Macody.  I'm not sure I have the name right because it was hard to read as he went by.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/2d/b5/3f/retired43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retired43,retired43 wrote a review Jan 2018,retired43,"Dunedin, Florida",301 contributions,138 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r553414785-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst airline I've ever flown,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This airline does have the universal fault of not catering to people of height. In variably the exit row seats are taken by diminutive passengers. An observation universally held by all fellow passengers in the group ""people of height"".

But the food was okay and and the cabin crew really obliging and genuinely pleasant.

My impression is that this is an airline the properly maintains its fleet so one tends to be unconcerned on that score. I have travelled with airlines where the window frames have been repaired by hand and you can see the brush strokes. That sort of thing does tend to prevent one dozing off in the flight!

We were on the bulkhead and the additional legroom not brilliant.  The proper issue though is that the fold out TV's did not work - no entertainment at all.  But at least we got the legroom.On the way home a different story - the ground staff in Munich just changed our seats and refused to entertain any variation - saying that my 14 yr old son was too young!!Irony has it that the legroom wasn't actually that bad in the ""new seat"" but ..... no TV - yup this time the whole flight was down.

A member of the airline crew opened the door, scowled at us and said ""excuse me"" in a very loud voice and slammed the door to continue with putting on her make up. Another staff member came and told us off for trying to use the business class toilet. I told him my son was desperate, he told me to go to the back and queue for the economy toilet. When I discussed the incident with the bursar, she apologised, but the apology did not come across as being sincere. She told me I should not lock loudly on toilet doors. Perhaps if a member of staff is more concerned with completing her make-up than helping a child, she is in the wrong profession. I have watched SAA decline now for years. Their actions towards economy passengers make a point of reminding you that they are there to enforce safety measures rather than make your flight comfortable. Poor entertainment, cheap headsets, poor food and now poor service. Two members of staff were concerned by the incident and I acknowledge them both, but the two that were rude to me were not asked by their bursar to apologise. I have frequent flier miles expiring annually, because I cannot use them for an upgrade unless I buy the most expensive economy class ticket, and pay more in taxes to use airmiles for an economy ticket than to purchased their cheapest economy ticket. Nothing left to entice me back I am afraid.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/1d/66/45/rosanne-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosanneb95,Rosanne B wrote a review Jan 2018,Rosanne B,"Harare, Zimbabwe",109 contributions,68 helpful votes,Munich - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r552126372-South_African_Airways-World.html,Economy Passengers do not deserve any better,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Departing Sydney on 07/11/17 for my 5 wk holiday travelling within Africa I was pleasantly surprised with SAA cabin service, some short delays on departures, however I found the cabin crew to be friendly, food & drinks were good and no bother asking for extra drinks in-between meals. Economy seats were reasonably  comfortable, my only negative comment was some of the aircrafts didn't have phone or laptop chargers. I had flown on 6 different flights within Africa, my first SAA direct flight 07/11/17 from Perth to Johannesburg & staying in Jo/burg for one week, from Johannesburg to Accra in Ghana for 2 wks on 15/11/17, my next destination to Cape Town 29/11/17 staying for 15 nights via Johannesburg. The last long leg was my flight returning home was from Cape Town on 14/12/17 & change aircraft in Johannesburg onto Perth arriving on 15/12/17. I used a different domestic airline carrier from Sydney to Perth. Overall I felt SAA ticket was excellent value including my return domestic flight Sydney to Perth & Perth to Sydney. I paid in total AUD $2,670.00 for all of my 8 different flights & would fly with SAA again in the future & perhaps use the same Website for booking cheaper airline tickets.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/8d/5e/f8/stephen-n.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uptonuponsevern,STEPHEN N wrote a review Jan 2018,STEPHEN N,"Smithfield, Australia",23119 contributions,718 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r552091729-South_African_Airways-World.html,SAA Pleasantly Surprised ! apart from some short delays on some departures,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked very early and got a good price. I tend to avoid SAA because their customer service used to be very bad. I was pleasantly suprised with the good service we got on this and the return SA260 flight. Hope they keep it up. The food is average, but so is most airline food. The seats are comfortable and I like the 2 -4- 2 configuration on this plane. Boarding was a bit unorganised but went fast. What I like is that you get a bottle of water and not just a cup so you have water throughout the journey. The toilets were kept reasonable.

"We flew SAA (SA 471) to East London 23 Dec and returned SA 480 on 26 Dec. Thank goodness we reported VERY early at O.R. Tambo as there were looong queues. And then one stands in the queue as indicated on the flight info and then after standing for a looong time someone comes around and says no all passengers to PE East London etc now had to stand in another queue. There should always be officers al the time at peak periods checking the whole time or advising if changes have been made to check-in points. HORROR! On the return flight especially, it was disgustingly dirty. The fold-down trays hasn't seen some Handy Handy for a very long time. Between the seats where armrest is, someone had stuck some chewing gum. It had been there a very long time as it was already discoloured from grease and dust etc - YUK! The windows were dirty and the encasement around window of cabin itself had some some splashes as if someone had at some stage opened gas cold drink and it got sprayed onto the ""wall"". The seats also looked as if they needed a good proper steam-clean. I did not even THINK of using the toilets as I can imagine what that would be like. On top of everything on the forward flight to East London (SA 471) my suitcase got damaged with a big crack on the side. When we reported it to the airline's office in East London we suggested maybe some heavy suitcase was put on top of it and the officer on duty said more likely it was THROWN! Yep, even employees know how things are at this airline.The child in the seat in front of us was never strapped down for landing and he was even sitting back to front looking at us!

This is a very long non-stop flight but luckily we got economy seats that were 2 across so we had some privacy.  But the luckiest part was the flight attendant--Boas Baloyi.

"Presumably due to seasonal demand, the aircraft used for this flight was one normally used for international flights. Both economy and business class seats were therefore larger than normally used locally. In this respect, it was better than other competitors for this flight.

As SAA increasingly tries to save on operational expenses, this shows in the standard of food. Even business class.

As a frequent long term traveler, it is evident that the standard of cabin attendant staff has deteriorated over the years. Simply, they are just getting more sloppy in their ways of going about their business. It’s time that the airline started removing staff who do not step up - if SAA wants their staff to return to the professional standard that it had in the past.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jozi2Melb,Jozi2Melb wrote a review Jan 2018,Jozi2Melb,Exec in Tokyo,161 contributions,65 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r551675200-South_African_Airways-World.html,Average ,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"1. I find that local flights and regional flights (short hall) have more leg room than the long haul flights. Is this just to punish us?
2. Maybe its my perception, I find the flight attendants to be rude on the regional flights e.g. Johannesburg - Lusaka circuit. They talk down to people and snap at them. However, I found that they were more friendly on the Washington flight. Could it be that they seem to hold US passengers in higher esteem?

"It really takes somethin special for an airline to mess up both legs of a journey. Well done SAA, you managed to do just that. Our inbound flight had no entertainment... 11 hour flight with no entertainment system working in all of Economy Class and very apathetic cabin stewards... You wouldve thought these representatives of SAA would then go over and beyond to pacify all the irate customers. Right? Wrong. They were nowhere to be seen, and when my partner's vegetarian meal failed to arrive (becaus they ""forgot"" to up load it), they were not open to any discussions... I found the Cabin Crew particularly unhelpful.

Outbound flight... Delayed. Missed connecing flight. Another six hours on an airport to make up for some poor, likely undertrained, employee of SAA, because there no ground crew to be found. We had to figutemit outmformuourselvs...

reached intl airport of johannesburg , had to collect checked in bags and re check in them but desk with 3 positions for this is empty...after different suggestions on where to go (SO DIFFICULT TO WRITE ON A BOARD WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE GONE??)
However time is tight but we eventually get to a desk of domestic airport where we re checked in our 3 bags (saa desk) and we show we have 2 backpacks and 1 cabine luggage with us. OK can proceed.
reached the DOOR of the aircraft we met mrs mpetsana who stopped us requesting us to bring on board ONLY ONE PIECE EACH as she says this is the rule (at re check in counter why this wasnt told?? and why airfrance accepting more than 1 piece each didnt allow us to finish our journey as we started it???
valuable staff was in the bags...but
WHAT REALLY IRRITATED WAS THE FACT THAT MRS mpetsana used A DIFFERENT CRITERIA with different walking in passengers!!! if its a RULE it SHOULD BE FOR ALL means EACH not one yes one no...this really was unacceptable.

"when we wanted to check in the day before our scheduled flight, we got a message saying we were not able to check in, because we were on ""stand by"". we had booked this flight many months in advance, and had made arrangement to pick up a rental car and to stay in a hotel the day of arrival in Port Elizabeth. So we rang travel agents, tour operators etc. We were told this is due to airline policy and our best bet was to get tot the airport early. Many airlines have the policy to overbook their flight since a certain percentage of passengers doesn't show up, so they can usually afford to sell more tickets than the number of seats on the plane. Since our flight was scheduled to leave at 9:30 AM, we set our alarm for 4 AM, and got to the airport at about 5 AM. We went straight to the counter, the stewardess made a phone call after which she checked us in.

This makes the fares really high, SAA is expensive whereas their services are mediocre.

I appreciate the free snacks and beverages. Free baggage allowances (compared to cheaper airline on the same route).

"We most often have taken a nonstop JFK - Johannesburg (JNB) which is the best value. On our most recent trip from Geneva (GVA), our outbound Turkish Airlines flight was to Cape Town (CPT) via Istanbul (IST) and our return trip was to GVA.  So, we used South Africa Air for our internal CPT-JNB segment..  It was more expensive than other airlines that cover that distance but they were the only ones who would book our bags directly CPT-IST-GVA even though we were changing airlines in IST from SA Air (vs. having to claim bags in IST and re-book them on Turkish Air).

"I was super excited to try out the new Airbus with their flat seats and the luxury space for putting my things. And some of it was indeed wonderful but as with most airplanes, not all things were equal.
I found that the staff was nice but they didn't check seat belts properly and thus I ended up landing once without a seat belt. This was due to the short end going under the cushion every time the bed went flat. I eventually saw someone else lift their bottom cushion to find the missing short end of the seat belt and so learned what to do the next time!
I loved the place on the side to put my things and spread out. The tray table was one of the best I have experience and easy to use. However, I couldn't get flat without the button becoming awkward; as once I started to lower the seat, it in fact went forward first which put the button behind me. The seat itself hooked a lot as the leg area is so small under the seat in front that it was impossible not to get the duvet tangled in it. But the most unpleasant experience was the fact that when the seat goes down, it feels like I was being put into an MRI machine feet first. Now if you understand that there are many of us that need to be sedated to even go near an MRI machine, you would understand the dilemma! Having said that, I loved the fact that I could spread out on the side with no one next to me. So I slept but just couldn’t move much from the knee downwards. As I’m short, this might be more for longer bodied people.
The entertainment screen was large with good colour sound and plenty of movies. However, when I turned off the entertainment system to sleep, it didn't hold the movie I was watching, so I would have to find it again and fast forward to the place where I had stopped. This has never been a problem on older aircraft so I found it disappointing. But the screen itself was big and thankfully I could reach it to use my hand as I couldn't figure out how to use the hand control at all, although I looked in the magazine to perhaps find some help. On my way out of JHB, the staff didn't even know there was a hand control, which could have been a problem as it was the only way to turn on and off the overhead light! I would really like to suggest that SAA needs to train their staff more carefully on any new aircraft that has different features.
The food wasn’t anything to rave about but was ok. Having written all of this I wonder why I gave it 4 stars, but flying business class is always such a huge step up for the cramped economy! I am writing this as I do believe that if you know what you’re getting into, then there is less disappointment with expectations.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/8e/0b/fd/ec101.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EC101,EC101 wrote a review Dec 2017,EC101,"Johannesburg, South Africa",33 contributions,5 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Washington DC,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r550023420-South_African_Airways-World.html,Business class on the new Airbus 330-300,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My husband and I had a terrible experience with FlySAA USA. After going through a fair portion of the posts below, it seems like there is an overwhelming number of unsatisfied customers, so we do not seem to be the exception, but rather are the rule for #SouthAfricanAir.

On our way to our honeymoon in #Namibia, we were denied access to the plane because my passport did not have 3 blank visa pages (even though the Namibian embassy‘s website clearly states that this is not a formal requirement).

The staff at the airport were extremely rude and disrespectful, dismissive of our situation, and refused to provide assistance and to present us with any legal documents, proving that we were unauthorized to board the plane, despite our many requests.

As a result, we had to switch our flight. We called the reservation line to switch our ticket and had to wait 55min before anybody at customer service answered; moreover, they refused to give us a direct contact, despite the urgency of the matter. Then, #FlySAA charged us $280 to change our tickets. This is by far the worst customer service, we have ever had from an Star Alliance Airline.

The customer service that we experienced from #SouthAfricanAirways is unacceptable and disgraceful, and we strongly caution anybody against traveling with #SAA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethkelley32,elizabethkelley32 wrote a review Dec 2017,elizabethkelley32,"New York City, New York",4 contributions,5 helpful votes,New York City - Windhoek,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r549710937-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst service; Honeymoon ruined by SAA,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I cannot remember one word exchanged between the cabin crew and ourselves before, during or after the flight. Our flight was due to leave at 11.40pm but was delayed. During this time the crew talked and laughed among themselves and never once had communication with the passengers. After take-off we chose to go straight to sleep and skip the meal. In the morning we were given a tray containing muesli and yoghurt, but no milk. Again, no communication from the crew. We are not ones for pressing the call button, preferring to wait our turn or ask a passing crew member. But none came. Our tray was taken and we waited for options for a cooked breakfast, but as the flight neared its conclusion it became clear that was all we were getting. Presumably breakfast orders were taken on departure as we slept. The plane was comfortable and tidy. The return flight was much better with a pleasant crew.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryo903,barryo903 wrote a review Dec 2017,barryo903,Gawler,10 contributions,2 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r548750425-South_African_Airways-World.html,Worst business class service ever experienced,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They called passengers on my flight to come to the front of the queue as they were ""closing' check-in. Turns out they had overbooked by 7 passengers so they wanted to close early and lock out late comers to justify their overbooking. Two of my friends were bumped off the flight to the next flight later that evening.

"Flew with South African Airways on a 40-hour trip from Lagos to Brisbane with a 15-hour stopover at the OR International Airport in Johannesburg. I had been used to excellent and courteous service in the past as a Gold Card member of the frequent flyer program, Voyager. I was shocked and amazed at arrival at the transfer desk at OR Airport to be informed rather brusquely by the lady at the desk that South African Airways has no provision for travelers like me with long layover time. Other airlines that I now use more frequently make arrangements for the comfort of their travelers for trips that are unbroken and under the same airline. It is a pity and shame that South African Airways would treat its paying cipustomers in such an apauling manner.

South African Airways has known for five years that Senegal was building a new airport. And that every ticket written by SAA would have to be updated to reflect this fact. Dec 7 the old airport closed and the new airport opened. It's been utter chaos as SAA had no system for automatically sending booked clients the new itinerary. I've spent 3 hours with Travelocity trying to change the airport -- making no other change in my ticket. No other change. 3 hours. SAA is utterly incompetent. Utterly. Hopelessly incompetent.

"I was on the SA 208 flight from Washington Dulles to Dakar's new airport (DSS) on December 8, 2017. The flight landed with more than hour delay due to problems at departure. Then, when we landed, we waited for more than 90 minutes for our baggage only to realize that they had not been unloaded from the plane. No announcement was made and nobody was able to tell us what was happening. Then, after a messy and long claim registration, we were told to call a number to get updates. Nobody ever responded to that message. I contacted the baggage claim number inSouth Africa where I was told by a very rude person that the luggage was in Johannesburg and would not be delivered before December 12. Worse, when I said that the company should at least arrange for a transportation of the baggage from the airport, located more than 60 km outside of Dakar (one hour without traffic and two hours one way during the week given Dakar's heavy traffic, i.e. one half day lost and most likely a $100 per passenger), I was told that there was no way this would be done.

"I've flown to and from South Africa quite a few times. This was my first
Experience of SA airways.
I was quite looking forward to using this carrier. Too be honest it was no better or worse than BA, and Virgin. I was expecting it to be better, as my girlfriend is from SA and thinks everything is better in SA!
The plane was clean, but a bit dated, the food was the usual Economy fodder and the cabin crew were a bit hot and cold.
Our seats were right at the back, we had three seats between two of us. This meant I got served from one side and my girlfriend from the other. My server was grumpy and never smiled once. My girlfriend's server was a really nice, friendly and jovial chap.
I suppose the tickets were a fairly reasonable price and maybe I should not expect too much.

"First of all, this was a SA Express flight, not SAA, but Trip Advisor does not list SAX in their list of choices. SAX is a feeder line to SAA and part of the South African Airways stable.
The experience was awful. Flight was delayed for 4.5 hours, for"" technical"" reasons, which is not a surprise, given the old age of their planes. Apart from the usual lame excuses, nothing was done to assist passengers in any way. No updates, no meal vouchers, nothing. After we eventually boarded, we were made to sit 45 minutes on the plane, as in their wisdom, they decided to combine the morning flight (our flight) with the afternoon flight and we had to wait for all the passengers of the latter to arrive. When someone asked one of the air hostesses why we were waiting, he got a rude response: ""didn't you hear what the captain announced"".
The flight was rough in an old Dash 8 - Q400 plane, with an even rougher landing. If I could, I would not fly with them again, but unfortunately there are not many choices on this route.
In summary: there is nothing ""Express"" about this airline. This is not the first time it happenened and will not be the last. It is not surprising that they are technically bankrupt and are only kept alive through huge Government subsidies!

"The airline seriously is in trouble. You can tell by the age of the aircrafts they use, the tight seats, poor entertainment system and disappointing food. Although some of the airline employees try their best to make the flight as pleasant as possible you can feel and see that most of them are not happy and do the job like a duty. Smiles are rare even if you try to be as friendly and helpful as possible.
The personal screens are small and blurry. After checking the options I didn't even bother more. Some passengers in front rows couldn't use the system as the arm holding the screen wouldn't stay up. Food was saved on, one could see. Having flown with many airlines, I'd rate this one just under average.
The seats were worn and very, very tight. I am not a big guy but I 35cm armrest distance is just too tight for most people. Looking around in the plane, many of the older and wider passengers had real trouble. This is especially an issue when more than one person in a row is wider. And the planes were filled to the last seat - so no chance of moving away.

This could be a passenger issue, but after a few hours, the toilets were impossible to use without getting wet feet. There were no paper towels left and the room looked terrible and smelled. On an 11 hour journey, I'd expect at least that once someone looks into this and brushes up.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/b7/44/bb/stephan-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanastabombasta,Stephan L wrote a review Dec 2017,Stephan L,"Munich, Germany",59 contributions,37 helpful votes,Munich - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r545101459-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Tight, old aircrafts with disappointing entertainment system",Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After having tried several airlines, combining airlines and stopping at various African airports, all to save a bit of money, I have now resorted to using just South African Airways directly from London to Johannesburg or Blantyre.  It costs more but it's worth it unless you're prepared to wait at 3 airports for up to 7 hours for connecting flights.  I now book online directly with SAA or with DialAFlight in London. Check with both and compare prices.  DialAFlight saved the day when I couldn't get a last minute flight with SAA but they had a reasonably priced seat for the next day!  One downside was the legroom.  I couldn't believe I had to fly 11 hours with the seat in front touching my knees.  Dreadful.  The return flight was a bit better.  I looks like they have added extra seats in the plane to sell a few more seats at the expense of the other passengers.  Not nice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/527elim,Lio wrote a review Dec 2017,Lio,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",13 contributions,3 helpful votes,London - Blantyre,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r545022791-South_African_Airways-World.html,Really good airline servicing Africa,Date of travel: February 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight SA053 was scheduled to leave Kotoka Airport in Accra, Ghana at 22:30 on Saturday 02/12. At 21:30, we were told that the flight was cancelled and all passengers would be put up in a hotel for the night, to depart the next day. A few minutes later we were told that after careful calculation, 97 people would be allowed to board the plane to go to South Africa. Apparently there was a mistake with the aircraft and this particular plane that we were being put into was over-fueled and as such, too heavy to land in SA with a full load of passengers. Please explain to me how this happens? Also, we were told that this was a problem that had been realised early that same day. Why then would they not tell us this at check-in? Or maybe a few hours before check-in, since that is when it came to the attention of the airline? Also, again, how do you over-fuel a plane and then make it the passenger's problem????
I was fortunately part of the 97 'chosen ones' who were able to board- but it gets better....
Upon landing in SA, we were told that our luggage had been left in Accra and we would each have to place a baggage claim. Again- plane too heavy- cant bring luggage. So off we go- all 97 of us, to the baggage claim area, where we find ONE person to assist with the paperwork. Lovely! This ONE person assured us that she had requested assistance, and that her manager was on the way to help. An hour and a half later- still no manager!
So I place my claim- a whole 90 minutes after I got into the queue. I am told by that one lonesome consultant that there was a plane coming in from Accra that very evening at 17:30, but as there were no delivery vehicles at night, I would receive my luggage the next day- which happens to be today. So today I call the baggage claims department and request an update. I am then told that only 5 bags were received yesterday, and the next flight is only coming in tomorrow- and then too, there is no guarantee that I would receive my luggage, because who knows which bags will be loaded? FANTASTIC! So I request to speak to a manager- and that's when the consultant cuts my call. So basically, I do not have my checked-in luggage after the airline erroneously put too much fuel into the plane- so now I am inconvenienced because of their poor project management. And I am not allowed to speak to anyone about it because they don't care. Am I upset? Hell yes!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/33/c4/56/fatima-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fatimas05,fatimas05 wrote a review Dec 2017,fatimas05,"Johannesburg, South Africa",71 contributions,14 helpful votes,Accra - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r545010090-South_African_Airways-World.html,Complete disaster!,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The female staff were a bit moody on the outbound flight which didn't make you feel welcome, there was one man who made up for it with his humour and kind personality.
The return flight all staff male and female were happy, smiley and helpful.

4.i couldn't claim my miles , i send an e.mail to their web site, they answered 5 days later with a ticket number with a promise to fix the issue in 2 weeks, for more than 30 days later i was trying to contact them but they were not replying, and when they answered they requested my boarding pass which was definitely is the trash by then.

"My husband and I are tall.  I have very long legs.  When I say looong, I mean it.  So when we decided to tour America, actually to try and see Kip Moore in Concert, we booked Business class SAA.Sadly by the time Kip Moore had pinned his schedule, we had already booked ours, and we were in Portland while he did his gig in Spokane.SAA is fabulous in Business Class.  Great food, coffee and snacks anytime.  Lots of space.  I slept at least 10 hours of the 16 hour flight.  The seats fully recline, you get a mattress, a duvet, two pillows.  It was fabulous.  We had only ever before flown to Europe, also business class.  So on deciding to tour America, see our daughter, we decided to look on this journey with delight instead of dread, and SAA came through with flying colors. Pardon the pun.  I know some airlines give you some amazing first class flights with showers etc, but that just costs a billion bucks.  SAA Business is affordable.  So, 5 stars for a great flight, great food SAA.  You only realize how good SAA is when we flew a 6 hour flight from JFK to Las Vegas and there was no food and you could only buy a soft drink.  American Airlines of all sorts suck.  We flew on many of them, and they are really bad.We were lucky we flew one way on a newly refurbished cabin in the A340-600.  It was really nicely done for these now aging planes.  I suggest SAA gets some A380’s or some Dreamliners to cater for the larger demand for trips to Europe and America.  Who the heck is running, or rather running SAA into the ground, I do not know.

Space & seat fine nice duvets & a mattress so you do not feel any bumps from the seat. Food ok similar to BA nothing special. Wine list very good   Service ok pleasant crew. IFE system very poor & selection of films bad. The other thing I did not like was there was no privacy screen between seats. As I travel solo a lot I do like these screens. I managed to sleep & breakfast was served into JNB which was passable. Would I fly with them again certainly not my first choice but passable if I had to.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/a7/4e/7d/lola008.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lola008,Lola008 wrote a review Dec 2017,Lola008,"Pulborough, United Kingdom",358 contributions,155 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r544865611-South_African_Airways-World.html,Better than expected ,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew the round trip with SAA, and I have to say one of the worst flying experiences I have had.
At check-in, we had arrived extra early to be able to relax and not have to rush around in the airport. We had checked in online and wanted to drop off the luggage, only to be told that luggage drop off was from 2 hours before departure- something I have never heard of before, even on domestic flights. Very inconvenient. We were forced to stay on the commercial side until we could drop off our luggage and only then go through security.

We were boarded by bus (on a A330) which I have to say wasn't the fastest but they seem to have the hang of it. My partner visited the toilet just after boarding and noted that the floor and rim of the toilet were covered in urine. The cabin itself looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned either, and there were bits of panelling above the passenger seats that were hanging loose.

On one of the legs, the senior flight attendant seemed to love the sound of her own voice and was doing extra long announcements, one just after gear up which went on for at least 5 minutes up until the cabin crew were released. We were also delayed on this leg and there were ""18"" passengers with a short connection, and the rest of the cabin were told to allow them to deboard the aircraft first. This was all very well and good, but in fact, several other passengers (including ourselves) had very short connecting times too. It was incredibly unprofessionally handled.

The service itself was poor, the whole cabin received drinks then had to wait at least 20 minutes for the snack. A hot meal is offered, but the choice was chicken or beef, not exactly a great choice for a vegetarian. They also had sandwiches, but they looked rather poor.

To top off the bad food, the use of electronic devices is prohibited at all times on board! This includes even with flight mode on. This is also actively checked by the flight attendants, so don't expect to be able to take photographs of the stunning approach into Capetown- because you're not allowed! I heard of this 10 years ago but in the modern age where airlines now have Wifi on board, this is a huge disadvantage- especially as the IFE and personal screen were not usable. During one of the legs were offered a short ""video"" on the forward screens on how to do stretches- I use the word video lightly as it was more a series of pictures on loop. Very disappointing on a 2 hour flight.

The one saving grace were the flight attendants themselves who didn't fail to have a smile on their face the entire flight, and provided a nice atmosphere with the terrible food - kudos!

Unfortunately for a frequent traveller in the Star Alliance network, I have to say this Airline is far away from the standards expected on board a star alliance flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alice_moo,alice_moo wrote a review Dec 2017,alice_moo,"Berlin, Germany",70 contributions,54 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r544721347-South_African_Airways-World.html,Airline stuck in the past,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On my second leg right now. Flying from Jbg to CT after a long leg from HK. And can’t understand why is it the long flight we were on an old version of airplane mode with no charging fasciitis, and the short flight to Cape Town is a brand new aircraft? The same story was on the way to Hong Kong. I seriously struggle to find a good explanation for it. Why not to give your best for the passengers who are on the long and tiring flights?
Anyway, as with my previous review I will repeat. If there was another airline that would pick this rout (e.g Emirates or Airfrance) SAA wouldn’t have a chance.

We flew business class which for a long flight automatically makes the experience better, but we were really impressed with the level of service from SAA nonetheless.

"We took this flight (Round Trip) because it was part of a vacation package with African Travel out of California and we wanted a Non-Stop flight to and from Johannesburg (each way was about 15+/- hours of flight time) departing from a USA city. The flight and staff for the 'most part' were very good but a few times I was bumped by a staff member as they were moving around the cabin isles and non of them apologized for bumping into me while in my aisle seat - even when one of the woke me up from their bump!  Other than the few bumps the staff was very good, efficient and courteous...  The reason I only gave this airline 4 Stars was because of this and the food they served (mostly dinners) was bland, non-descript and either under cooked or over cooked and soggy... Thus, the reason for the title of my review - So, bring a couple sandwiches and/or snacks from one of the vendors after you go through security and you should not be disappointed in what you will be eating.  All drinks were included on the two flights and lots of movies to watch on the back of the seats in front of you - one can pause, stop or cancel any of the movies, too.I chose our vacation package (partly) because SAA is one of the only airlines that Offer a Non-Stop flight from the United States East Coast (JFK,NY - Dulles, Wahington,DC & Atlanta,GA)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/40/d9/f2/nr0369.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nr0369,nr0369 wrote a review Dec 2017,nr0369,"Boston, Massachusetts",9 contributions,,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r544604752-South_African_Airways-World.html,Very good service but bring your own meals...,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown to South Africa from the US for years and have always spoken highly of the service and friendliness of the cabin crew - but there was a notable change in the service this time - a much less friendly/pleasant crew...  The seats in Economy Class were uncomfortable especially as regards (lack of) space..  Soooo difficult to get any sleep on a fully booked overnight flight.  Food was average....just!  Also - a rather ""rough"" extra ""security inspection"" just before boarding SAA in Johannesburg:  women lined up on one side and men on the other, carry-on bags opened and passengers patted down..  Why?  Most uncomfortable and upsetting for the children who were with us.  Also, complete chaos ensued at the airport as boarding was delayed and no one could tell us when the plane would take off.  Johannesburg Airport (Oliver Tembo) also needs do something about the lack of seating in the areas near the gates - many people sitting on the floor for lack of seats!!

My wife and I recently vacationed in South Africa and flew several times in country on SAR. Those flights were on time and well staffed and reasonably comfortable. Our flights to and form South Africa are an average of 15 hours non stop and are more demanding of the crew and passengers. Seat comfort is average and in flight entertainment  also average. The system to get entertainment is bulky and often not responsive. The service is less than expected as the crew disappears for hours mid flight. A snack was available but never announced and you had to go back to the galley to get one.

"Well, what can I say. Going to South Africa is a dream come true. Flying on a small airline: if things go well it's all good. If not, it can be really bad.The biggest problem with this airline is their HORRIBLE lack of communication. We had a relatively uneventful flight over. We paid for exit row seats. When we got there, the plane had been reconfigured and we were in the row behind the exit row. We were able to wrangle seats in the center of the plane but we went from having just the two of us in the row to sharing the row with a very large man--not fat, just Shaq O'Neill large. He took up more than his share of room(we were in the center of the row) but tried hard to stay on his side. The flight attendant was sort of like ""oops"" sorry about that, but did let us stay in the exit row in the center through to Johannesburg. (the flights stops in Ghana--more about that later.) We switched planes in Johannesburg. That flight was great!My bag was destroyed on our flight from Capetown to Hoedspruit--despite filing a claim I have yet to hear anything from them in anyway since MAY. Will they pay: who knows?My biggest complaint was about our flight home. We had an aircraft issue that was discovered on our stopover in Ghana. Are we happy they found the issue: yes. Are we happy with how they treated us after: no. We had to stay overnight to get a repair part. They kept up on the plane for a couple of hours. They let the business class off to get visas. They kept us on and fed us (so they didn't have to feed us on the ground, I'm sure.) They told us they would let us off a few at a time to get visas and would have a representative on the ground to assist us with the process of getting to the hotel and getting through customs. NOPE no representative anywhere. The people in customs were overwhelmed: it was late, they didn't expect a plane full of people, they were frustrated, we were frustrated, it wasn't pretty.  My passport was gone for quite some time. It made me more than a little nervous.  Strange country, no passport, no cell service, no real knowledge of where we were going and when. They told us we would be staying at one hotel: we actually ended up in another hotel. The problem with that? The 2nd hotel didn't get any information on when we would be leaving. They kept telling us to check back in an hour. What that meant was that we got absolutely no sleep because we didn't know if they were going to tell us to gather our stuff and be in the vans to get to the airport.  We got to take a shower, they provided us with lunch at the hotel and we had a bed that we could lie on but that was the best rest we could get. We were finally told to get to the lobby at 4:30 PM to leave at 7:00. The lines at the airport were horrible--hot, sweaty people lined up for a block outside.  Our passports were checked by armed guards at least 4 times and we were examined more than 3 times before boarding. No dinner. They put us in a waiting room that was like a prison waiting room. (If you left you had to go through screening again-since we didn't know when we were leaving we were afraid to leave the room.) Angry, frustrated people and tired children everywhere and no information about why the 7:00 depart time had passed. Later we were told we would be boarding at 8:30, then 9:30 when that time passed a near riot took place when a representative told us to please be patient and wait a few more minutes. Finally over 24 hours after we were first supposed to leave we were finally boarding--at 11:00 PM. We found out that the people in the first hotel were told fairly early that we wouldn't be leaving until evening (so they slept) We got nothing. Even trying to call the airline resulted in a voicemail that said is was full.  We obviously all missed our connecting flights out of Dulles and were told that they would get us another flight...our trust was nil at that point.Turns out if you were on a Star alliance plane they did get you hooked up with a new seat on a new connecting flight but none of us knew that til we touched down in Washington DC.

"This is the worst flight I've ever been on and I will never fly SAA ever again. I would have to be really desperate to get to a destination.

The attendants were rude for the most part, except one. The flight was late leaving the gate and I was told by a frequent flyer, that on this route (DC to Johannesburg), it is not uncommon for them to be upwards of an hour late out of the gate.

The food is poor and the inflight entertainment system is extra poor. The sound quality was horrible, the monitor was unresponsive. There were a few who complained as their units were not working.

Way too many chimes and bells at night, so it makes it hard to sleep. Ding, ding, ding, ding, 5 minutes later, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Shut it off.

The worst part of this experience is how they sprayed the plane for insects. The attendants walked up and down the aisles smiling away as they sprayed an insecticide INSIDE the plane with PEOPLE on board. Who knows how ""safe"" this ""poison"" is for people. They sprayed in DC and they sprayed in Ghana after our stop there.

I will never fly this horrible airline ever again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/f9/b9/c6/zebra-4456789.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zebra_45678,Zebra_45678 wrote a review Nov 2017,Zebra_45678,"Indianapolis, Indiana",1135 contributions,347 helpful votes,Washington DC - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r544319395-South_African_Airways-World.html,"Horrible Flight Experience, Spray you with Insecticide, Never Again.",Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The good: Customer service over the phone is courteous and helpful. The flight attendants were amazing, friendly, and went above and beyond to make sure everyone was taken care of at all times. This was a 15.5 hour flight, so that was no easy task. The in-flight entertainment was standard.

The bad: The food was subpar, with one particular dish being sent back uneaten by many people. And they ran out of the edible dish, so many people went without. So the staff (the one redeeming quality of the airline) passed out extra snack boxes which were wonderful (one box was an assortment of cheeses and crackers, and another was filled with a delicate assortment of fine chocolates). The seat divider between the seats does not go all the way up. So if you're lucky enough to have an empty seat next to you, you still can't really stretch out as the divider stays in your way.

The ugly: The pilot needs to be sent back to training. The takeoff was too steep, turns were not coordinated (step on the ball, man!) and he hopped on the landing. It was bad enough that people screamed and I thought he was going to porpoise (where the hops become steeper and worse until something gives - usually the front nose wheel).
To be fair, the pilot that needs to be sent back to school was on the flight to Johannesburg. The other pilots were fine.

We also used South African Airways to get from Johannesburg to Cape Town (the overhead bins were very small and the seats seemed smaller with less legroom); Cape Town to East London (a flight without issue); and then East London to Johannesburg (no issues), and Johannesburg back to the states. Throughout all flights, the attendants remained the shining star of the airline, the seat dividers cumbersome, and the food left much to be desired.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/784michellen,Michelle N wrote a review Nov 2017,Michelle N,"Jacksonville, Florida",146 contributions,179 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r544309383-South_African_Airways-World.html,"The good, the bad, and the ugly",Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I received an email Xmas day special $1 950 Perth to Cape Town to 30 September 2017.Called SAA to book 3 tickets a few days before 30 September was told they only have more expensive seats left.,and that I should call a travel agent.

For the record the travel agent on the 30 September had seats at this price.When I complained about it received mix messages on 2 different occasions when I called Perth SAA Office.
One employee said the tickets should have been available to 30 September 2017.Another told me when I called that if the travel agent has tickets SAA would have the same and that the only difference to the costs should be the taxes because of the exchange rate.Wrote to SAA customer service which did not bother to reply but prides themselves on customer service. After not hearing from Customer service admin in Perth said they will ask them to reply urgently. Received a response sorry for the late reply a reply that was never forthcoming.

"Flew biz class from JFK to Johannesburg on SAA. Service was excellent from airport checkin to onboard experience with a humorous and efficient attendant.

From Johannesburg to JFK the service was so so. The SAA Check in counter told us to use our eboarding passes which the airport security did not accept so we had to walk back to SAA counter for a printed boarding pass. It seemed to be an effort for the SAA counter attendant to do it too. On the Johannesburg to JFK flight the service was not the same as going - no nibbles during the long 15 hours back after the dinner nor no beverages after the breakfast... possibly from the flight being a little bit turbulent.

"The service was acceptable yet the attitude of the airline staff inconsistent. Some were very friendly. Some were utter miseries looking like they were doing me a favour by being there. The food was ok. Nothing exceptional. The seats recline to full 180 but they are still lumpy and so uncomfortable to sleep. The in-flight entertainment choices are poor, the system is not easy to navigate and the quality of the picture is shocking. But seriously.... for a business class passenger, the highest quality of alcohol brands is totally unacceptable for the price of the air ticket. Smirnoff Red is the best choice Vodka offering. Embarrassing! In Business Class, something like Grey Goose is far more appropriate. And what is this thing of 'turning on' the in-flight system only once the plane is at cruising altitude, unlike Emirates where you can start watching immediately. The only advantage to flying this route is the direct non-stop flight and getting there quickly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyingmaestro,flyingmaestro wrote a review Nov 2017,flyingmaestro,"Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",5 contributions,,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r542715697-South_African_Airways-World.html,Not worth the cost of the ticket for Business Class,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have travelled with this airline 3 times. Twice in 2016 and in August 2017 with my daughter and her infant. It is so far the best for me. The flight was smooth and comfortable and the flight attendants were exceptional. (Courteous and very polite).
For the three times that I flew with them, there were no delays whatsoever. (Departed on time and arrived on time). No layovers since its a direct flight..
I definitely recommend this airline.

"My partner surprised me with business class tickets on our first trip to Africa together. Whilst the check-in & lounge at Perth airport was seamless & nice, once you step onto the plain that's where it all ends. The seats are outdated & cabin crew lack the warmth & general customer service attitude that you would normally find on equivalent airlines. When I inquired about an amenity kit (as we were flying after midnight & I wanted to brush my teeth) I was told to share with my partner. Dinner service was simple & the attendants were rushed. My partners TV didn't work & after one attempt to restart it the flight attendant said there was nothing more he could do. By the time breakfast was served close to our arrival, we were once again rushed & had no choice of meal.
Overall I would NOT recommend flying with this airline. It was a true waste of money & you're better off in economy. I have flown international business class multiple times & this has been by far the worst I've ever experienced. If it wasn't for a direct flight I would even consider going through Asia or the Middle East just avoid this airline & their pathetic excuse for business class.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/e6/06/fe/noelle-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434noellec,Noelle C wrote a review Nov 2017,Noelle C,"Budapest, Hungary",167 contributions,72 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r542395306-South_African_Airways-World.html,Don't waste your time with Business Class,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Old but well-kept and clean Airbus Industrie A340-600 aircraft.
South African Airlines is a member of Star Alliance and the Star Alliance policy since quite some years is that cell phones and tablets may be used in flight mode during take off and landing, but SA wants all electronics to be switched off.
In business class old and hard chairs. Possible to recline to almost a flat position, but these are no proper flat-bed chairs. The chairs are also quite short especially if you are taller than 6 feet. Difficult to sleep as the reclined chairs are extremely hard and uncomfortable.
Good information from the flight deck. Cabin crew quite nice but the service was poor, e.g. wine for dinner was first served to some passengers with the dessert.
A late dinner was served. OK but not more. Quite good South African wines.
Small, old screens with low resolution. Limited selection of movies and TV-shows available in the in-flight entertainment. No wifi. Power outlets that functioned on and off during the flight.
Small restrooms without the usual business class amenities such as toothbrushes, razors and so forth. Restrooms were not cleaned during this 11 hour flight. Most airlines clean their business class restrooms these days.
Departure 10 minutes delayed due to disorganized boarding and extremely slow passport control. Arrival 20 minutes late.

"We had planned our vacation to South Africa 10 months ahead and were very excited about the trip. We booked business class tickets with United miles, since it was a 15 hour flight from JFK to JNB.

We arrived at JFK and at the counter they told us our tickets could not be accepted because our names did not match our passports exactly (we always use first name and last name) we have flown over 50 airlines and this has NEVER been a problem. The tickets had to be issued again by United. Since we had already flown a portion of the flight this could not be done. So to be able to fly we had to by new tickets!!!

We told the manager about our issue and she couldn’t care less, she was rude, and told us there was nothing she could do, just to hurry if we wanted to make it. Not one sorry for the inconvenience etc.

The flight was a nightmare, bad food, bad entertainment (my system didn’t work the whole flight).

We had booked another flight from Cape Town to JNB and to Mauritius on South African, and guess what? We had no problem with our tickets and with using our first and last name only. So now I wonder, did they not honor United miles for business class, did they overbook, did the manager not like us(it was clear she didn’t) This made the beginning of our trip very stressful! Thankfully we found great hospitality all through South Africa except on their airline!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/bc/49/cc/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tishcadena,Tishcadena wrote a review Nov 2017,Tishcadena,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",84 contributions,17 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r541272213-South_African_Airways-World.html,TE RRI BLE!

The evening meal was  terrible a choice between fish and beef, I had the beef and was sick most of the flight home.The cabin staff are  lazy and didnt answer the call button for bottled water. I had to walk to  the back of the aircraft, for water.

"Traveled from JFK to JNB in October and elected to bid for SAA's Step-Up offer from economy to business class.  There is no way to logically figure out what amount of bid will secure the upgrade.  The online gauge will indicate how successful your bid might be but you will have to determine what you are willing to pay and hope that it's accepted.  We offered $1,550 each, one way, and our bid was accepted.  We bib the same for the return and got upgraded in both directions.  It's a lot of money but remember it's a 15+ hour flight and well worth the extra if you can afford it.   Forget trying to get your travel agent or the airline involved.  It's all done electronically and you are only advised 24 hours in advance of departure.

"We flew business class in a South African Airways Airbus A330 from Washington Dulles to Johannesburg in late October.

"Our ticket said Terminal B, but one airport person said Terminal A. The online flight info said Terminal B. It was not displayed on the departures board. The Info Booth at the airport was unmanned. Shortly after 15 mins a woman in uniform strolled to the counter and opened for business. She said Gate A6. We were unsure who to believe.

So I walked To Gate A6 and asked people who were sitting there who confirmed they were waiting for the same flight.

If you are in the same situation as I was, it is Teminal A, no matter what your ticket or online info says.

There was no dedicated line for Business class, so we joined the queue. Once insides, the flight attendants were pleasant and friendly.

"Pleasantly surprised with the economy class of this airline.  Much more comfort, service and amenities than any economy service US airline.  Seats were roomy for the average adult and both bottom and back seat reclined.  You received pillow/blanket and comfort bag (toothbrush,toothpaste,socks and eye mask) from JFK to JNB.  Meals and all beverages were fresh and plentiful.  Over night, sandwiches and water/juice were left in galley area for self service.  Staff was very friendly and professional.  Honestly glad we did not ""bid"" on the business class for an additional $1700+pp per flight.  Transfer in Joberg to Cape Town was overall seamless and the 2hr connection time is not an issue unless you are late out of your departure airport. One thing to be aware of is on most aisle seats of the Airbus A340-600 one cannot store anything under their seat (all must be packed in overhead compartment).

"I chose to travel Business class because of medical issues and paid nearly $6,000. for my ticket. I could do a lot of travelling with 6 grand, instead I wasted it on SAA.
The trip over was uneventful but sleepless. I left my Kindle on the plane and it was never retrieved even though I was back at the airport later and filed an in-person loss claim. I know. I left it.
My troubles began with the return trip. We got to the airport very early and checked 3 bags. 1 in business, 2 in econ. Although we boarded in time I was never offered champagne and by the time the FA responded it was too late. Also, her accent was so thick I had to ask for repeats throughout the flight. It was terrible. As sleeptime approached the foot part of my seat would not lift. I had a window and my seatmate was asleep. After way too much disturbance I said ""Leave it. I'll deal with it."" I should have demanded better service as I barely slept.
We disembarked and waited 50 minutes to find out we had no bags.
The lost bag attendant never smiled, never apologized and when asked for her full name would not give it! We were given a claim form with a number that did not pick up for the next 12 hours. When a person did respond we were given no reassurance that the bags would be located. Five days later I got my bag. The clerk doing the forwarding could NOT understand why my bag did not go with the other two. It took 2 ""cutoff"" calls and my insistence that the address be repeated until correct, (3 tries,) that this could even BEGIN to happen. In the meantime I had no bathrobe, no clean clothes, no other shoes and no coat in New York in November. I paid $6000. for this kind of treatment.
Since the trip over wasn't bad and the return was a disaster for days I believe that South Africa Airline owes me an apology and $3000. It is with deep regret that my flight experience so overshadows my trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F9063EPjanets,Janet S wrote a review Nov 2017,Janet S,,4 contributions,1 helpful vote,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r538834420-South_African_Airways-World.html,Yes of course it could be worse.,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We travel to South Africa a lot and have regularly used SAA, in fact their internal flights are some of the best we have used around the world. Always on time, friendly staff and good quality food and snacks and again on our recent trip we could not fault them. However the same could not be said for their international flights. On our last trip we did have a few issues on the plane but because of their good past record decided to give them another go.Booking and check in was easy and straight forward, and we settled into our seats for the 11 hr flight. However most of the plane were unable to use their TV monitors ( this is what happened before on our previous flight!) despite the issue being raised by most of the passengers and several attempts to re-load the screens, nothing happened , so we were entertainment less for the whole flight. We were a group of 7 and after a week 3 flew back to the UK with SAA whilst the other went onto Cape Town to extend the trip. On the first groups return again half the plane had no entertainment system and again it remained unresolved after several attempts to re- boot the system. The other issue was the heating of which there was none! It was absolutely freezing even with 2 blankets you could not get warm. Our group returned to the UK 5 days later, again on our flight half the TV monitors were not working , there was one token attempt to reboot but then nothing happened not even an apology. The airline staff were terrible speaking in their own language the whole time and almost ignoring the passengers, dishing out drinks and meals without any eye contact or attempt to make conversation with passengers again just talking to each other. Then overnight again the cabin was absolutely freezing , but again no help was offered by the staff or apologies.  I really felt sorry for the young babies that were on the seats in front of us.In the morning when they were serving breakfast almost the entire plane were wearing jumpers and coats, when we commented about the heating the stewardess said "" Why are you cold?"" when we explained it had been freezing overnight ,she just turned away and just carried on serving meals. To add insult to injury when we were coming into land another stewardess strapped into her seat and shivered saying she was so cold sitting there, as we said you should have been here all night!! Just shocking that there was no explanation or apology for an 11 hr journey from hell. Will never use SAA again and will recommend that no'one else does. They may be cheaper than other airlines but now I can see why!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/84/bc/cb/traceys1964.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redkitewatcher64,Redkitewatcher64 wrote a review Nov 2017,Redkitewatcher64,"Andover, United Kingdom",1648 contributions,278 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r538774995-South_African_Airways-World.html,Will never travel with them on an international flight again!,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It is always lovely to turn left and be treated like VIPs. The flight left and arrive on time. I had the most pleasant flight with the crew. Flight Attendant Karen M. was in charge in our aisle and she was just superb. Her fellow crew members were just as professional.

The amenity kit had a lovely SA design. We were offered drinks before take-off. The main meals came soon after. As the flight took off close to midnight, I did not have the appetite for it. So I cannot comment on it. However I did have the canapes, it was so elegantly presented.

The flat bed was really comfortable. Frequent travellers just helped themselves to the covers from the overhead lockers. Some flight attendants just dumped the covers at your feet with no explanation, but we were handed ours.

The socket for the headphones was in the most inconvenient a place. It was at the back of the arm rest, underneath it. You had to be contortionist to plug it in. The noise cancelling headphones worked well. Great current movies.

The amenity pack was in the small compartment back of the front seat.

Bottles of water was left our on trays whilst we slept. Very considerate.

There was a massage option on the chair, which I used extensively. I was so relaxed I did want to get off!

"On the way out my inflight entertainment did not work, along with many others. The service was appalling! I had pre-ordered a non-dairy meal as I have a food intolerance, but I never received it as they had run out so I had to go hungry. When we arrived in Livingstone they had lost one of our bags.
Later in the trip we took a flight from Livingstone to Capetown. When we arrived in Capetown and collected our bags one of them was a canvas bag which was very damp. That would have been bad enough but the damp was due to having some sort of fish oil spilt over it, the smell was disgusting and my clothes ruined!!
On the way back to London my husbands in flight entertainment did not work, again along with most of the other ones.
We have written 3 times and the hotel we stayed in also emailed them as they were witnesses to the disgusting fish smell which had been spilt over our suitcase. We have received no communication what so ever or any apology for their treatment of us.

We only had 2 x 1 Hour delays, this is nothing as we encounter this when you fly within Australia and I am sure this would happen in other countries as well.
My husband is a tall man and he had heaps of leg room, we were actually amazed at how much we had as you do not have any in the Australian planes, his knees always hit the chair in front, unless you pay extra and get an exit seat.
The Stewards and Stewardesses were very polite, very friendly, impeccably dressed and nothing was too much trouble.
But the best part was the food, every flight you had a choice of 3 hot meals (Beef, Chicken & Vegetarian), along with this you got a salad, bread roll, desert, chocolate, cheese & crackers, tea or coffee and alcohol. They always asked if everything was okay and if we wanted a refill. I was actually so impressed I took a photo of the food and sent it back to family saying that Australian Airlines need to take a leaf out of the SAA book. When we actually got back and took our flight form Sydney to home the food was dismal, you have to pay for the alcohol and we were both saying we wish were back on the SAA planes.
I am shocked to read the other reviews as we never had anything but great service, great food and a comfortable ride, keep up the great work SAA, we will only ever book with you guys when we come back.
By the way we were so impressed we decided to do this review.

"We flew on the 9th Sept on the 7pm flight. I held off writing this review as I was hoping for a response from SAA. I write a complaint email and then sent it again to the email address on the website. I then tweeted and was given an alternative email. I have sent a copy to this email too. I have then gone back to twitter regarding the lack of response. Still no response. I am now going to go tot he ombudsmen or whatever the next step would be.
Our flight was delayed - this would not be enough to illicit a complaint. But we had a connectine SAA flight to Windhoek and no info was made re connecting flights. During the first hour of the delay I went to ask the stewardess for her advice. I was polite. I was met with stares and inaccurate information, and then later plain rudeness. I witnessed the same stewardess treating another female customer who asked a similar question with an even worse attitude. She continued to glare at me throughout the flight and bark at me. I didn't dare ask about anything else. Who knew what she would do to my drinks etc!!
My seat didn't fully recline. The seat/leg room was the most uncomfortable I have had on a flight ( and I am only 5ft 2!). And my screen never worked, despite a reset attempt ( although even the attempt wasn't tried for a few hours..). On the return flight we were given flight socks etc but not on this flight.
When we finally arrived at Jo'berg the pilot said their would be ground staff to help those with connecting flights. There was no one. And the biggest queue I have seen in my life..honestly. SAA had even printed the WRONG terminal number on our boarding card which added to the confusion. Many people were upset and stressed. There was no consideration by any SAA staff for the customers and the problems they faced.
It was only through luck and the good will of the people in the queue who let us in did we make our next flight. I have no idea what we would have done if we had missed it.
I will never fly with them again and urge people to book elsewhere.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/8c/a0/ac/gaildevonshirelass.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaildevonshirelass,gaildevonshirelass wrote a review Oct 2017,gaildevonshirelass,"Pedrogao Pequeno, Portugal",306 contributions,251 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r533211161-South_African_Airways-World.html,Terrible flight and intimidating stewardess,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Took the early flight operated by SAA Airlink. When I booked I requested gluten free meal which I did not get. What was dished up cannot be described as a meal but at best a snack and seeing how expensive the ticket is I think it is a disgrace. Would suggest avoiding Airlink but insist on SAA. Check in at OR Tambo OK but be prepared for drama when you get to passport control. They do not have sufficient staff and getting your passport stamped can take hours so PLEASE ensure that you arrive way ahead of time.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danie92,Danie92 wrote a review Oct 2017,Danie92,"Johannesburg, South Africa",300 contributions,75 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Lusaka,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r532097197-South_African_Airways-World.html,Avoid SAA Airlink,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Unfortunately after a delay at Heathrow we eventually arrived in Johannesburg, we had to go through immigration, collect  our cases then rush to check in for our connecting flight to Phalaborwa which we only just made. We were then transported to the plane by bus. At the steps to the plane the air hostess politely told us to leave our hand luggage with her as we could not take it onto the plane which everyone did. On arrival at our destination I checked my hand luggage to find all our cash had been removed I had split the money up so they hunted through my bag. I have been emailing SAA for the last 5 weeks but they have not come back to me.

He didn't answer but stared at me intensely as if I kill seal pups for a living. Then he reached out to grab my blanket and threw it in the overhead bin as I was folding it.

I was extremely embarrassed and scared since he was raising his voice at me the whole time and causing a scene. I'm 5.1"" and the guy was towering over me.

Everybody else had their blanket on the floor or behind their backs and it was fine. The cabin was kept very cold the whole flight. You will be asked to put away your blanket before taking off and landing. Also, the entertainment system will not work until you are up in the air and will stop at least 45 minutes before landing.

"We had 8 flights with SAA on our visit from Australia to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania. The long haul parts (4hours +) were Business class and the rest Economy. This was our first time with SAA. Hospitality and friendly staff made the flights more enjoyable. Comfort for sleeping was good, staff did not wake you any earlier than they had to (some airlines seem to wake you to suit the staff rather than the passengers - I mean 3.5 hours for breakfast before you arrive!). Food was generally good and of course local SA wine was welcome. Movie selection was down on other airlines but still plenty of options. Lighting was fine (we have been on some incredibly bright light flights with some Asian carriers). Staff were efficient and calm without being rushed and were happy to have a chat.
The only incident we had was in Business JBurg to Nairobi where the senior staff person said there was no in flight entertainment on board only to find out otherwise 10 minutes later when her assistant brought out tablets for viewing.

When I went to check in 3 hours before the flight, I was informed I am not on the flight. I was sent to 3 different desks to try and find out what was happening. The SAA staff were grumpy and rude. 3 sat staring at a computer and agreed that I was on the flight, but claimed there is nothing they can do about it. 40 minutes later i was informed that my seat had been sold and there were no other seats available for the next two days.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyE434,Roy E wrote a review Oct 2017,Roy E,"Perth, Australia",5 contributions,6 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r529733549-South_African_Airways-World.html,Absolute shocking.

"This flight was the major part of travel from Cape Town to Sydney.  Check in and luggage drop was not a problem.  The service was very fast, with virtually straight to the counter experience.  Luggage was quickly tagged and booked through.  Egress from the lounge was direct to the boarding gate and the cabin crew were extremely welcoming.    Service was prompt and friendly with the menu of food and drink as expected.  During the flight I had a minor medical incident and the staff could not have done any more for me and the problem was resolved during the flight by the crew.  In flight entertainment featured recent movies, music, games, information.  Noise cancelling headphones were provided as were blankets, pillows and assistance.  The sleeping compartment was not the new ""flat bed"" seat but for the aircraft, the seat/bed was comfortable.  I understand that not every plane will be ""the latest and greatest"" but the crew were outstanding.

The equipment, ie: the seat and PTV were broken. The flight attendants try and do their best but I think that they find it embarrassing as well. Customer service is non-existent. I've been disconnected from the phone system of 4 occasions.

"I was booked on flight SA 572 on Sunday, 24 September, which should have left at 17.40. I had a connecting flight to Perth, Western Australia.

I arrived at the airport in good time, but was unable to find my flight number on the board, so approached a member of the check-in staff. She advised that my flight had been cancelled, due to the following day being a public holiday, and I was booked on the next flight. She checked me in and labelled my bag trough to my final destination.

I was not impressed by the off-hand manner in which I was treated, the lack of courtesy and the lack of apology. A notification of the new arrangement would have been appreciated, especially as the friends who had taken me to the airport in time for the earlier flight had had to cancel an arrangement to get me there.

While these things happen, an explanation, an apology and an assurance that there would be plenty of time to make the onward flight would have gone a long way to mitigating the inconvenience - and the long and boring wait in a very uninspiring airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/8a/avatar011.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJRAustralia,SJRAustralia wrote a review Sep 2017,SJRAustralia,Australia,118 contributions,95 helpful votes,Durban - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r528606592-South_African_Airways-World.html,Shoddy,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelling on South African Airways from Durban to Johannesburg, I encountered friendly stewards and hostesses.  I felt that they did go out of their way to make the passengers feel comfortable and safe during the flight. Tea, coffee and juices were offered. Plus a small yoghurt and croissant was also offered.  Not a very appetising breakfast meal, however the food was fresh and sufficient. The air plane itself was clean and an SAA magazine was provided for some interesting reading. There were also pop down TV screens which played adverts and films, although now sound was provided.The flight was approximately one hour long.

There was no lounge in Maputo for Velocity Gold members.

On check in we noticed all the travellers going to Lisboa on TAP were getting their bags wrapped. We didn't worry about ours but when we arrived at JNB, we realised that the bags had been opened (must have a TSA key as the locks were not broken).

"While South Africa Airways can be nice for transcontinental flights in Business Class the same can not be said for Economy Class on their Express counterpart.

The flight gate area is like a big holding pen for cows. So much of an echo you can barely hear announcements. Our flight left 2 hours late and we were all packed like sardines onto a bus to go to the plane. We had booked seats 2a and 2b on what was supposed to be a jet with a 2 x 2 configuration. But we were put on an old Boeing 737 with a 3 x 3 config so my wife had the middle seat which sucked. We were so cramped, I have never experienced such discomfort. It's like the seats were set up for children! My knees were touching the seat in front and I am not a big man.

They served a horrible excuse for a meal but the beer was free so I give them a point of that.

"Check-in was prompt and pleasant.  The agent offered to check my bag through to my final destination in Zambia.  This had not happened before on previous occasions.  When I checked in for my domestic flight in Lusaka, I was asked if I had any baggage to check in.

An airport staff member was supplied to help me locate the bag and I was led through various security areas until the bag was located.  Thus a protentially problematic situation was avoided, as my ultimate destination was located some 2 hours drive beyond my final destination airport and all my clothes were in the checked bag.The early morning flight from Johannesburg is operated by Aouth African Airlink using Embraer 135 equipment.

I've used SAA before but it seems that the service has gone downhill recently. We left within 20 minutes of the scheduled time so that was not too bad.

"We booked a flight from DAR to GEORGE departing 20th September 2017, in July 2017. On Friday 15th September we recieved a call from Expedia informing us that the flight from DAR to JNB was cancelled. We were offered two options a) a later flight on the same day, which would mean no connection to our final destination, and no offer of a hotel overnight, or the same flight route on the 21st or 22nd September, again due to commitments on the 20th this offer was also not suitable. After long discussions with Expedia who were trying their  best to accommodate us, and by this time I had probably spent more than $100.00 on phone calls, we asked if they would change the original flight to either the 19th or 18th September they had no luck contacting South African Airways to make the changes, and had no policy in place to authorize the change without approval. So On Saturday afternoon still without answers I started trying to contact South Airways directly, after several attempts, speaking to various agents who did not have any solutions we eventually had an agent who after speaking to a supervisor agreed we could travel on the 19th, the flights were not very convenient with a seven hour layover in JNB but at this stage what could we do? She confirmed all our details, and after some long hold on the phone (again at my expense) she came back to tell us she could not confirm this booking as the connecting flight was South African Express, and they had no agreement in place with them. So we started again, and asked for our last resort Monday the 18th, after long waits on hold again we were told this was not possible as it was more than two days prior to our original departure, so the final solution from South African Airways was for us to cancel the original booking with a 100% refund which will be refunded in 7 to 21 days and re book the flight ourselves for the 18th September. Which we did with an additional $108.00 fare difference! so thank you South African Airways YOUR CANCELLED FLIGHT  has cost YOUR CUSTOMER and additional $208.00 ....",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allaboutholidaysUK,allaboutholidaysUK wrote a review Sep 2017,allaboutholidaysUK,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",70 contributions,18 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - George,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r525426758-South_African_Airways-World.html,What happens when the airline cancels your flight !,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The last time I flew SAA was a return trip from CPT to JNB on my Kruger holiday.  I have flown SAA many times over the years, and probably done this return journey at least 50 times, so I have a base of reference on how the airline has evolved over the years. Overall SAA has maintained a good standard of service over the years, but I have felt recently, and particularly on this trip, that standards were fraying on the edges. Its difficult to point out exactly what it is....maybe its the greeting at the door of the plane that feels more perfunctory than genuine (even on relative Airline standards) or maybe its the sometimes robotic onboard service. Whatever it is, against a broad global and regional comparison, it feels like there is some tiredness creeping in. It remains my preferred airline for internal travel in South Africa, but no longer a preferred alternative for long haul travel.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/64/a9/34/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubergine_man,aubergine_man wrote a review Sep 2017,aubergine_man,"Geneva, Switzerland",496 contributions,7262 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r525223248-South_African_Airways-World.html,Standards on the edge,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have experienced traveling internationally on South African Airways for more than 3 decades and it continues to deteriorate. I will comment on both our international and in-country recent experiences. Our business class flight from US to Johannesburg was not bad and one of the flight attendants, Brian, was particularly good. Others were acceptable if not particularly attentive. Return flight from Jo'burg to US lacked any top notch flight attendant, but at least it was mostly benign neglect. Our flight, again business class, from Jo'burg to Cape Town was awful! Herded around like sheep to slaughter and flight attendants who couldn't be bothered and were surly when you did request something. With all the fine wines in RSA how is it that they had NO WINE to offer in business class on this flight??? Return flight from Cape Town to Jo'burg in Economy was a better experience - at least they had wine to offer. ALL flights were late departing.  Also, don't bother to respond to SAAs request for your flight experience, after 5 months NOTHING from them! There are better local carriers in-country and you should use them.

The SAA flight over to Aus was a bit hampered due to faulty seat entertainment devices not working on all of the seats- pity, as I was in a seat with this problem. however the flight was comfortable.
I had also requested a special diet as well, and this was attended to no problem.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558lesleyn,558lesleyn wrote a review Sep 2017,558lesleyn,Kimberley,11 contributions,,Johannesburg - Brisbane,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r522174827-South_African_Airways-World.html,travelled well.

"Why does SAA persist in appointing cabin staff that don't want to assist/serve passengers? Cabin staff ignore the call lights and when asked for an extra bottle of water never arrived.

"I had to fly SAA to Victoria Falls in July 2017. I had been warned not to carry valuables on my person in case of theft. So I packed my cell phone in my checked luggage. It was stolen on the return trip to South Africa. I filed a claim by email. I got an automated response with a name of Customer Service agent, and nothing since. My travel insurer will not cover unless the carrier has investigated. It clearly was someone with an xray machine as nothing else was missing. It was a targeted theft.

Beyond that, I found the staff unresponsive on the flight--entertainment wasn't working.

"A 2 hour delay is the order of the day. Technical hitches with aircraft, aircraft delayed, waiting fora replacement.... it will be here shortly.... Theseare the list of reasons for the delay for the non departure of a flight at 15.30 on Monday 21 August. If it wasn't for the concerned attitude of groundstaff,the congeniality of passengers and friendliness of cabin staff - the frustrations could have led to higher states of aggravation.

"The GOOD: having the ability to bid on what would otherwise be unused business class seats. What a great idea, and run very efficiently! We did this on all 4 flts we took (Windhoek to Joberg to Livingston Zambia back to Joberg to Nairobi. The BAD: for a tall person like me, there was minimal leg room unless I had first row aisle. On the first flt on July 10, the flt attendant didn't try very hard to ask someone in the first row to change.

"It was the first time I have flown with SAA. Having heard a lot of negative feedback about their service delivery and quality of service, I thought to try them out for myself. We took off on time and the flight was magnificent - smooth sailing until we touched down. Although one hostess must have been having a bad day, another was quick to apologize and treat me like a king. I paid about $15 more for my ticket, compared to the local low budget airlines, but unlike on the cheaper airline, I got lunch and refreshment for free! Now, this is a big deal if you are a student like me and free stuff is just about as good as a scholarship... The colour scheme of the interior is inviting and warm and makes you feel at ease. Seats are comfortable and I had no discomfort whatsoever.

"Required to purchase a new ticket for my partner as her original ticket was in her SA Passport Name. The passport she is legally required to use when departing  South Africa for an overseas destination. Her Esta for Canada is listed on her Italian passport which is in her maiden name as all European countries use this procedure. The same Italian passport has a cross reference to her married name(same as on her SA Passport). No amount of debate could persuade the SAA  officials to reverse their decision and a new ticket had to be purchased at the airport in the name on her Italian Passport. Now we have travelled extensively together utilising British Airways to the USA, Singapore and Qantas to Australia where an Esta is issued by these countries in her maiden name as listed on her Italian passport. All these trips were without any hassle from the airlines concerned. The last such trip was undertaken in December 2016 without mishap. SAA would not budge, yet when we left Vancouver to return to SAA the Lufthansa agent queried why her ticket was in her maiden name and not the name on her South African passport, suggesting that there was no need to have purchased a new ticket upon leaving South Africa....Officiousness or desperation to fleece another customer.

"Firstly the plane was delayed. We boarded the plane only to be told to go back to the terminal since there was something wrong with it. So we went to the terminals to wait for another plane coming from Richards bay apparently. secondly no clear communication from the airline to inform all passengers. so we boarded the second plane, which we sat there for about 45 minutes listening to back and forth of our bags being offloaded and then the supervisor saying they should stay. this was supposed to be a 18H30 flight to BFN, but by 20H25 we do not know whether we are leaving or staying. eventually the captain decided that we cannot leave as BFN airport said they are closing at 21H00pm and if they cannot make it before that time they must not continue with the journey. frustrating really couldn't someone negotiate with the airport for satying extra 30 minutes to wait. I am sure it is much cheaper for them than to book a lodge for all the passengers and inconvinience all of us.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/62/d9/66/nyeiks-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyeiksm,Nyeiks M wrote a review Aug 2017,Nyeiks M,"Bloemfontein, South Africa",13 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Bloemfontein,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r518646971-South_African_Airways-World.html,Indecisive action by airline about flight to go or not to go.,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Flying from the east coast of Australia to South Africa can be a long and tiring ordeal. We picked SAA because it provided the shortest leg from Perth and allowed us a stopover on the way back. The quality of travel was up with the best and the aircraft age and fittings were modern and recent. Economy is always a test of endurance but everything worked and the service and food was better than expected.

South African Airways has descended from being a first class airline to a disgraceful national carrier. Having flown with the airline for 16  years I no longer use them for my regular flights between Johannesburg and London. The interior cabins of the planes are shabby and poorly maintained. Broken seats and non working entertainment systems are common. The food in economy which used to be excellent has also deteriorated and the attitude of many but not all of the cabin crew has also deteriorated.The overall impression of South African airlines now is one of an airline about to implode.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825billysm,Billys M wrote a review Aug 2017,Billys M,"Cape Maclear, Malawi",20 contributions,4 helpful votes,Johannesburg - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r518642956-South_African_Airways-World.html,Decline of a once excellent airline,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Considering all the challenges SAA is currently facing we were very pleasantly surprised when flying to the USA via Frankfurt and then returning via New York.  Check in staff were friendly and helpful and the entire check in process was painless - we were unfortunately not able to change seats as these had already been booked by our agent but at least we had aisle seats as requested.  The meals were as good as you'll get on an airline and additional snacks were available in the galley if you still felt hungry.

After I showed then the online printout where it clearly states 32kgs they refused to load the baggage until I had paid the additional R900 for the overweight. On other airlines you can take two pieces at 23kgs each. Thus they do not stick to their online conditions and exploit the customers at the counter.

"I have flown to and from Johannesburg many times over the past 10+ years, choosing to travel Kenya Airways or South African Airways.  With the current challenges being faced by KQ, I thought that it would be good to fly South African after a brief hiatus.  My main area of contention with SAA was the inflight service that we received during this trip.  Firstly, there only seemed to be one attended in the entire economy cabin.  Second, this attendant was at least 50lbs over what should be the weight limit for a flight attendant - and yes, this is relevant information....  As a consequence, he would move from row to row, using the seats on the preceding row to lean on, jolting passengers back with his weight.  This wasn't the worst of it; the crew member also spent an inordinate amount of time socializing with a couple of inebriated passengers; fuelling their parade and adding to their loud conversation. This lethargy and lack of a sense of duty extended to the speed and efficiency of the entire in-flight service; and because there wasn't another crew member to assist, everything was excruciatingly slow.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/63/4c/24/nadeem-n.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadeemN,Nadeem N wrote a review Aug 2017,Nadeem N,"Nairobi, Kenya",181 contributions,40 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r518630438-South_African_Airways-World.html,Terrible...,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In all of my travels this was probably the worst experience I have had. We were supposed to depart at 15:30 so my work colleague (from France) and I arrived at 14:00. We were told that the flight had been delayed for half an hour. That turned into nearly an hour. During this time there was a delayed notice on the board and at the gate. At about 16:30 I noticed that the flight number was now alternating between SA 1013 and 1017. When the ground staff were asked we were told that flight 1013 had been cancelled and they were now boarding flight 1017. There followed many arguments and some of the travelers from flight 1013 were put onboard. What should have been an hours flight resulted in us landing in Bloemfontein at 18:30 or thereabouts. The only good thing was that our luggage arrived with us which surprised me greatly. The ground staff were absolutely useless and very unfriendly. The only saving grace was the air hostess onboard the plane.

"SAA is probably one of the most reliable airlines to travel with in Africa. I can vouch from experience. As soon as you have to take another internal flight on the continent, you have no real idea what will happen. One hears of serious management issues at the airline, but this does not seem to have affected the planes and crew, at this stage anyway!

Food, seating, comfort, service is generally of a good standard, and the longest flight I've taken is around 8 hours, usually with a stopover somewhere from West Africa to Johannesburg.

Flying from Mauritius as my departure point, there is little choice to get to West or East Africa, but there is nothing wrong that with either.

"Living in the middle of nowhere does not give many options for a direct flight to South Africa. We always fly with SAA and have never had a bad experience over our 11 years of yearly trips. We also usually fly with SAA within SA. We have seen our airplanes improve over the years with better in-flight entertainment and staff that are usually very pleasant.

"We experienced South African Airways recently for the first time, as a result of our trip to South Africa from Australia.  The seats, leg room, personal space and comfort are what one would expect in terms of an economy seat on a long haul flight.  What I would definitely make comment on though is the lack of food/snacks throughout the flight.  As is the norm, we were served a main meal soon after take-off, then we were served breakfast about one hour before landing.  However for the bulk of the flight, (some 9 hours!), we were unable to obtain anything at all to eat!  I walked to the galley and asked the cabin crew for a snack, to which they replied that they did not have anything!  Not a biscuit, cracker or anything!  I have taken many long haul flights with other airlines and have never experienced that!  There are always snacks of some kind on offer throughout the flight.  Nine hours is a long time without anything at all to eat!

"Flying Lufthansa Vancouver to Munich.  Arrived Munich 2pm and departure screen listed my South African Airways flight to Jo'burg as being ""on time"" at 21:05.   So, 7 hours to kill, walked the length of the terminal,  read a book, then 2 1/2Hrs before departure, still posted a being ""on time"" went to the gate.  Could not see a flight info screen from this gate.  After a while, another passenger arrived to tell us the flight was cancelled and we should all go to the Lufthansa desk.  The flight was cancelled as the aircraft had not taken off from Jo'burg.  It was in fact, cancelled already when I arrived at 2pm!   SAA did not advise Lufthansa.   Consequently, the single person at the Lufthansa desk was suddenly mobbed by over 200 passengers!   Extra help arrived, but it took 4 hours to clear everybody.  We were sent to a hotel near the Airport.  where I arrived after midnight.  Next day, an SAA flight arrived in the morning and we all boarded.  There was a delay of over an hour due to congestion, so we arrived in Johannesburg late, and about half the passengers missed their connection flights - me included.  However, when we cleared immigration and customs, there was not an SAA representative to be found!  After about an hour, a local fellow said that SAA usually used a hotel (told us the name , but I have forgotten it) and suggested we just go to the bus terminal outside and go to that hotel.  Sure enough, a big coach turned up, took us to the hotel.  SAA had advised the hotel, but no advice given to passengers!   A second unexpected night in a hotel!

"South African Airlines offers hardly any services for the poor folks in economy class.  As soon as the plane was in the air, food was immediately served.  That was it for 11 hours.

I went back and there were nasty sandwiches and some crackers.  Honestly who bother!!!  2 hours before landing they served breakfast which was mediocre at best.  If you wanted a tea or a drink...you had to get up to get it.  I found this very strange.  On the way home...the service was much better but it was an overnight flight so sleeping was a given.  I went to the back of the plane for tea.  I was given some but told I had to go immediately back to my seat because you can't stand while having a hot cup.  But its ok to walk 20 rows forward with boiling water.  I vowed I would never fly SAA again.

"The flight from southern Africa to the US is a tough decision as it is a long one. I flew back from Africa on SAA's direct flight from JNB-IAD which has a stop in Accra to refuel and swap passengers. While it was nice to stretch my legs, I found the stop more of an annoyance than anything. From my experience, there  is no way that they ever could do it in the scheduled one hour. It took way longer, and is disruptive to sleep as it is in the middle of the night. We left JNB on time but with the extra long stop ended up late to IAD, which made my layover very very tight. Baggage claim in IAD was chaotic as well, with 2 baggage claims and it was unclear what was where. In the end they put transit bags on a separate carousel, most but not all of the time--and for some reason these came out at the end/last! [I made my connection by literally 5 seconds, they were closing the door-and I ran the whole time. United wasn't helpful at all at radioing to hold it etc.] The SAA flight itself was ok. The staff were nice. The food was ok but repetitive after a while. I would've appreciated one of the meals being more of a snack than another chicken or beef dish. The breakfast was awful and noone ate it (pancakes).  Wine was good. Seats aren't great but are average/typical size for this day and age. Would have definitely paid for economy plus, but sadly they do not offer it.  That would make a huge difference on this flight. My seat location (53 aisle ) was good.  Movies were good but my screen stopped working in the middle of the night. A final note--in JNB, you had to go through security again at the gate--and they made you toss liquids including water that you had bought in the terminal. They should advertise this so you don't spend $5 on water that you then have to throw away--and so you can leave time for this in your planning.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/cb/9d/9a/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khark,khark wrote a review Aug 2017,khark,"Mount Pleasant, South Carolina",107 contributions,13 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r518500668-South_African_Airways-World.html,Ok flight but layover in Accra was too long!,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The business class seats are so far apart that you need to take off your seat belt to access the storage pockets in the seat in front. But the main problem for me on this A330-300 was that the bed was not only not quite flat but it was too short for my 190cm and my legs had to rest on the metal footrest which I had to keep folded: if I'd opened it it would have made the bed shorter still.

"I am a very regular world traveler and I just debarked from the worst flight of my 40 years of extensive first and business class flight experience -- on Flight 204 from JFK to Johannesburg, in Business Class (price: $8,500 USD).

The service was extremely rude, the food was awful (cold congealed fat posing as lamb chops, anyone?), the staff was condescending and horrible, and they refused even to give me copies of my complaint forms (which means I'm sure they just threw them away). They also refused me anything else to eat as a substitute meal, leaving me going 30 hours without eating.

I highly recommend that everyone avoid ever traveling of SAA for any reason, particularly in its overpriced business class (in which my bed did not lay flat and my video player did not work the entire flight).

"Ground staff in Sao Paulo were great. We sat at the emergency exits and whilst sleeping, sunglasses and other items were stolen from the magazine pouch at the window. I am very sure that the only people who had leaned into our space were airline crew, to shut the blind, and at one point, due to turbulence, two crew members were seated across from us in their jump seats. Upon discovering that items had disappeared, we reported this, only to receive shoulder shrugs. Ground staff at Oliver Tambo then refused to accept that our excess luggage had been paid for all the way to Cape Town and they claimed that if there had been currency shifts overnight, we would have to pay in...ridiculous! No mention of a currency change in our favour with a reimbursement. So, all these calls and calculations resulted in a lost onwards connection...no apology...just the opposite: abuse.

"To be fair, I'm going to post the same review on Air Namibia, between the airlines,they need to review and understand what a client is, including how an airline should treated any client.

We arrive early at Windhoek airport. My colleague is flying back to JHB in 2 hours and I'm flying in 4 hours back to Cape Town. We're sharing a rent a car.

At check in, Air Namibia asks me if I would like take an earlier unscheduled flight. Nobody tells me that it's with another airline, less luggage KG allowance and a very small plane. So as a client, I get excited and say yes.

I'm directed to Air Namibia client service where they manually write my name down on a sheet. We gather and then the lady that helped me, leads all the volunteers to SAA and a special queue. So far, everything working.

And so begins the client nightmare.

I get to the check in counter and I'm now 2kg overweight for the SAA small plane. If I stayed with my original flight on Air Namibia (an airbus), I would be within the allowance with a kg to spare. SAA says I must pay, I don't argue (I just want to get home as quick and smoothly as possible). I get a luggage printout and told to go to the counter and pay excess. My suitcase is dispatched.

I arrive at the Air Namibia client counter and she tells me that I must go to the SAA counter, which I do. The lady at the SAA counter says she can't let me pay because I don't have a computer system ticket for that flight (I've been manually added to this flight at the specific request of Air Namibia).

I go back to Air Namibia, they can't do anything, the lady at SAA now walks over to Air Namibia and in front of the client (me). Aggressively asks why they are sending Air Namibia clients to her without a ticket.

At this stage, I ask that I be put back onto my original flight with Air Namibia. They took me off the list and after two attempts to retrieve my suitcase, they find my suitcase after a long time and I check in with Air Namibia, exactly how I started 1 hour and +/- 30 minutes before.

So now I think it all done and over.

After shopping at duty free, I walk into the waiting area and hear my name announced. Apparently SAA still has had me on their list even though my boarding pass says Air Namibia and a different flight. I walk to Air Namibia boarding counter and they say, go to SAA.

At the SAA counter, the gentleman is angry, aggressive and as I approach to inform him that I'm actually not on their flight (I'm being courteous), he asks my name and as soon as I confirm, he merely states twice and aggressively (and I mean aggressively) that I've been offloaded from their flight, which I'm not on. I didn't need to inform another airline that there records are wrong and that my bags are not on their flight. I was expecting a thank you for informing them. It just goes to show, that I was never considered as a client or traveler.

If any friend asked me, how's the best way to fly to Namibia from South Africa, without hesitation I would say, consider BA, I fly them locally all the time, they don't consider you as a client, you are the client. It seems Air Namibia and SAA, don't have clients, merely irritations using their services.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/7b/ac/6a/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xcvhcchhhh,Ccccc wrote a review Aug 2017,Ccccc,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",232 contributions,255 helpful votes,Windhoek - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r512269920-South_African_Airways-World.html,Catastrophic client service ,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Why must we as the customer be hunting down our bag? We paid SAA to carry them for us, but we have to run around to find people to help us.

On the for that my wife was handed, she was informed that she can receive $75 in compensation per day that she does not have he bag. SAA knows that she took the flight.

"While I know SAexpress is separate they fly under same banner. My small carry on bag with my cash was put through a scanner before boarding a Dash 8 turboprop.

Apparently, it was an inside job as my bag NEVER left my side until arriving on the tarmac to board the plane. Ground crew FORCED me to check the small bag seconds before boarding, I tried to reason with baggage handler by stating it was small and fits everywhere (I wasn't aware of the set up), she argued with me momentarltiy and I complied being in a foreign country. BIG MISTAKE!

I was so caught off guard and it happened so quickly I didn't even think of it, but after 22hrs on a plane I was a bit bleary.

When I got to Hoedspruit and minutes later my camp for safari I immediately checked for my cash, you guessed it, the ground crew robbed my bag and clearly an inside job after X-ray machine.

I contacted SA express immediately and to date no surprise not so much as note.

I've flown all over the world and this by far was the worst flying experience. Worse yet SAexpress doesnt seem to care one bit. Very sad for them.

There's scum everywhere, but I wouldn't allow them to ruin my holiday.

I flew SA air to Johannesburg for my honeymoon. I am a pretty tall guy so knowing that it is a very long flight i bought the exit row seats. When we boarded the plane in Dulles we got to our seats and realized they weren't exit row. Thinking they made a mistake i told the crew about it and was told to hold on. After waiting and waiting i asked them again about my seats. They told to wait until the plane has fully boarded and they will figure it out. After the plane was fully boarded i again asked them what was being done about my seats. I was told that i did not have a exit row seat and there was nothing they could do. To make a long story short i argued till my face was blue but to no avail. When i landed in Johannesburg i approached the customer service desk and told them my situation. They said i should have had a exit row seat like i paid for. They offered no compensation except for email the airlines and ask for money back. After months of waiting and emailing (since SA airlines does not have a customer line to call) i finally received my refund. I bought those seats 4 months prior to my trip and they didnt even apologize or offer any compensation. I thought the entire crew and customer service desk were rude and unhelpful.

The staff were really helpful and even though I had a 13kg madam on my lap through the journey I was pretty comfortable. The flight was really full but we got through it with no major disasters.

"I flew with South African Airlines on 7 flights during my 2.5 week trip to and around South Africa. I am sure it is common to have some unpleasant experiences with an airline but their customer service is the WORST I ever experienced. They will waste hours of your time, and they will never answer you.

Most of the headphones are broken on this airline, good luck trying to watch a movie with two working ear pieces.

The attitude of the flight attendants are far from pleasant. They act like they hate their jobs, try not to ""bother"" them and ask for something.

There was a mix up with my special meal and on a 15 hour flight they offered me nothing but an apple.

The reservation desk gave me false information which forced me to switch my flight from MRU to JNB to the earlier flight. I was charged to switch. The flight turned out to be at half capacatiy and I found out what the reservation desk agent told me was false, so I paid for a flight change for no reason.

I called customer service and did not get an agent on the phone for over 90 minutes before I finally gave up.

I tried speaking to customer service in JNB airport but each person was more unhelpful than the person before them.

I called three times to confirm my special meal for my subsequent flights and on each one of the flights they had no record of my special meal.

On our flight from MRU to JNB, the plane was freezing. When we asked for a blanket, they insisted they did not have any, but after pressing them they finally went and got my wife and I a blanket. Why did we have to beg for a blanket?

I sent multiple emails, never got a response.

AVOID THIS AIRLINE. They will find a way to squeeze money out of you.
They have the WORST customer service and the nastiest flight crew.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveneW343NK,steven e wrote a review Jul 2017,steven e,New York,6 contributions,6 helpful votes,New York City - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r503997590-South_African_Airways-World.html,Avoid this airline.

"So I made a mistake and for some reason left out a letter form my middle name and SAA didn't want to fix it. So I had to buy a new more expensive ticket. And had to cancel my ticket. I emailed immediately afterwards and didn't get a reply. Three weeks later a wrote another stronger worded e-mail. Two day later in the evening I got a reply. It will take 21 working days to to refund your money. Two weeks later I took it with @flySaa_ care. And after back and forth they promised to expedite my refund. By now it is 25 working days for a while international ticket that I had to pay twice for.

It is 5 working days later and still waiting for my money. I had to cancel flight before with international airlines. 3-5 working days then I had the money in the bank.

That is after they stuck you in a bus at OR Tambo airport so full of people you can hardly breathe and then you have to wait another 5 min because the airplane is not ready inside that bus.

"Travelled to and from Johannesburg in June/July and paid extra for leg room seats . Seats really narrow and uncomfortable,could barely get the tray past our bodies when pulling them down . Entertainment screen was loose and kept flopping on both flights and had to hold in the earphone jack the entire time for  it to work . Extra leg room gave us exit row seats and that was the only benefit,no where to put your personal items ,all items had to be put up as no seat to put bags under. People waiting for toilets stood on our feet ,and left the doors to toilets open with lights on ,staff made no attempt to close them ,in fact they were quite unfriendly the entire flight .

"We have flown South African Airlines a total of 6 times over the last two years. I found the experience better than average, and certainly better than our domestic US flights.  The in flight crew was friendly and professional.  The boarding staff somewhat less so.  A snack or meal was offered on each of our flights, none of which exceeded 3 1/2 hours in duration.  Free alcoholic drinks were available. In flight entertainment was offered, along with free headphones.  There is no choice in the show offered, but there was one on each flight of at least 2 1/2 hour duration.  The seat was relatively roomy and the cabin appeared clean.  The only negative I saw was that several of our flights were delayed by 1/2 hour or more, but as we did not have connecting flights for these late arrivals there was no negative consequences.

"Absolute worse experience of my life.  My friend and I were on our way home from a wonderful trip to Cape Town and we first had a layover in Johannesburg.  From Johannesburg, we initially thought we were flying directly to Washington D.C. but we didn't realize that we were going to have to stop in Accra Ghana.  Our first leg of the trip was fine.  We landed in Accra, the team stripped the plane and made sure that it was ready for the Accra passengers to have a place to sit.  An hour later they told us they had a leak and could not fix it because the Accra airport did not have the supplies or was fit to fix the plane.  Another hour later they said we would be spending the night.  5 hours after sitting on the plane they finally deplaned us and got us visas for Ghana.  We were all upset because no one had the proper vaccinations to be in Ghana and our phones did not work.  We were also told the entire time we would have a customer representative at our hotel to arrange flights once we arrived in Washington.  They shipped us off to hotels and that was the last we heard from the airline.  We ended up sitting at the hotel for 12 hours and had no idea when we were going to leave and how we were going to rebook our flights once we arrived in Washington.  Once I found out an estimated time of departure, I called my connecting carrier in Washington to rebook my flight and paid the $200 change fee for each of our tickets to ensure we would have a flight home.  SAA never compensated us for our change fee and the only compensation that they gave us for taking away 24 hours of our lives was 25% off our next SAA flight.  I will never EVER fly SAA again and advised all of my friends my terrible experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SavvyTraveler632,SavvyTraveler632 wrote a review Jul 2017,SavvyTraveler632,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",1 contribution,,Johannesburg - Washington DC,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r501914984-South_African_Airways-World.html,Stranded in Ghana for 24 hours -- A Living Nightmare,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"South African Airways was rated one of the best airlines in the world, during the 80s and 90s. However, in the post apartheid South Africa, it is now rated one of the worst! All SAA flights (both domestic and international) from Brisbane to Durban were totally disappointing in terms of the quality of the airlines, in flight services and general service on board the flights. The air crafts are outdated and not equipped with the latest entertainment devices. With regards to meals, something that looked like a snack was served rather than a full meal, in comparison to other airlines. The service on board the flights was equally disappointing.

"I fly often and this was my first time flying SAA and it'll definitely be my last! It's the worst airline when it comes to customer service and being helpful. We missed our flight because the attendants at the airport decided to leave their counter before the last check in time. We arrived 30 mins before the time given and they still wouldn't work with us because they ""had closed for the day"". When we called the SAA customer help line, they were shocked that the counter had closed before their ""usual"" time and apologized but they wouldn't rectify the mistake on their part. They offered us another ticket the following day for a fee of $425 and although we didn't want to pay it, we said fine. We were told to go back to the airport the following day and arrive at the counter to pay the 425$ rescheduling fee. When we arrived the following day at the airport counter, they told us the price had changed and it'll be $733 each now. They knew we were desperate to get to Ghana for a funeral and decided to squeeze more out of us. We called the SAA customer helpline again and wanted an explanation on the price change and they were just appalled as we were but once again, they couldn't help us although they admitted that wasn't right. So after paying an extra 733$ for this flight, the ride was a disaster as the seats were extremely uncomfortable, the meal was disgusting and their flight attendants not courteous or respectful. If you think flying Spirit is bad, you're in for a rude awakening with SAA. Please avoid SAA if you can.

"At the airport the gate is changed with no announcement - you see other travellers starting to stream somewhere else and discover the change (yes, you can get the notice on your cellphone IF your service provider allows it - NOT ALL OF THEM DO!!!). At the new gate two airline hostesses stand silently until the display above them changes to Flight Cancelled - and of course there is a rush of Serengeti proportions toward them. Eventually we all hear the plane has ""developed technical difficulties yesterday and the parts will not arrive in time for the scheduled flight departure"". Must have been some serious difficulties if they had to specially order the parts, but what do we know. We then stream down to stand in line for an hour or so to get on a bus and be taken to a hotel where we are to be accommodated. All of us only in possession of our on-board luggage, as our checked bags are held for the next day. Rooms are not ready so everybody (300, 400?) claims a seat (mostly on the floor) in the hotel lobby and another wait begins. We eventually get a room at half past three (been waiting for the flight since nine am after flying from Seattle the previous evening) so all we want is to shower and get clean. We have to dress in yesterday's clothes again for dinner, and again the next morning, when we manage to finally get on to the plane.

"I chose to fly with South African Airways to Johannesburg as they offered the most convenient and cost effective option for my trip.

Starting at Heathrow, because I hadn't checked in online, I had a positive experience with the check in staff who helped me to choose my seat and sort out my baggage. Everyone I encountered in Heathrow terminal 2 was efficient and friendly.

The plane itself was an A330-200. It was clean and comfortable on board. For the outward leg of the journey I was in seat 65A and had two seats to myself. On the way home I was in 60A and there was someone next to me - although I noted those further back had two seats to themselves (a consideration if you have a choice and it's a night flight - you might want to spread out a bit!).

I didn't make much of the inflight entertainment myself, so can't really comment. There is a touchscreen where you can play games, choose to watch tv shows or films (many of which were dated 2017), look through duty free shopping items, look through the menu for the flight, or - my favourite option - look at various different map screens to see the progress you're making on your journey. As others have commented, there are no ports for charging devices in economy. There is no on board wifi.

The drinks service was quite frequent, including alcohol and tea/coffee. The cabin crew made it clear at several points that you could ask for drinks at other times as well if you wanted to - although I never did.

The food - I don't consider myself an especially fussy eater, but on the way out the options were lamb, fish or mushrooms - none of which I like! The breakfast wasn't too nice either, perhaps because it was served at 3am I wasn't quite ready for it! The food on the return trip was much nicer - I had spinach and cheese pancakes with tomato sauce, and the breakfast of cheese omelette and bacon was very tasty too. They offered a cold / continental breakfast option for those who didn't want a hot meal.

The seats were comfortable and I was able to sleep a little in the reclined position. The seat pitch was perhaps a little restrictive - I am only 5'6"" and couldn't put my legs comfortably straight. In economy class they supply a blanket and a pillow, plus a little amenity set including eye mask, flannel and toothbrush / toothpaste.

The toilets were relatively clean and there wasn't often a queue.

There was mild turbulence en route, but the flight crew had told us to expect this in advance. The take off and landing were some of the smoothest I've ever had, and the flight as a whole was great. The pilot and captain kept us well informed throughout.

The cabin crew were the highlight - so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. They really seem to enjoy their job and like working with people. It makes everyone so much more relaxed on the flight.

We arrived slightly early both on the outbound trip to Johannesburg, and the return to London. It was seamless, really. I was very impressed with the airline and would have no hesitation recommending them to others. I'd also be very happy to fly with them again myself, should a South African flight be an option on my route.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/32/0c/54/em-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em_bee_mcr,Em B wrote a review Jul 2017,Em B,"Manchester, United Kingdom",139 contributions,90 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r500012894-South_African_Airways-World.html,Pleasantly surprised,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS HAS BEEN GIVEN ANOTHER R2.3 BILLION BAIL-OUT.  Credits: Cape Chamber of Commerce & Industry.If you have recently flown on SAA to OR Tambo, from the US, you will have noticed what's wrong with this Airline.  Something that is certainly lacking is it lack of consistency with customer service.  One male flight attendant was fantastic, but the rest of the crew needed a few more months of training.  At one stage of the flight, one female flight attendant all but knocked over an elderly gentleman who was standing up to stretch.  No apology.  She just kept moving.  When a passenger in front of me queried his not being given the meal he had requested, he was accused of not ordering correctly.The cabin in Economy was also warmer than normal.  The warmest I have ever experienced on an International flight.   People complained after ordering orange juice, and tasting a mango/orange drink.  They were told 'this is our orange juice'...In Johannesburg a gate was completely empty, but they denied customers from sitting in the chairs if they weren't boarding.  Only in South Africa?Americans choose this airline for it's direct flight into Johannesburg.  The pilots did an amazing job.

"I had forgotten how bad South African Airways (SAA) could be. Between 2009 and 2011, I worked in Africa and flew SAA many times. They regularly lost my baggage, although credit must be given to the fact that they always found it and delivered it 24 hours later. I missed connections twice because of how inefficient their transit was. But I had forgotten about it all after 6 years without flying SAA. But I remembered it all yesterday when I was denied boarding in Washington, DC for a minor technicality.
I have several middle names which were listed in the reservation correctly, but there was one space separating my middle names from my last name (e.g., my name was written like (MM_L) instead of (MML), where M=middle name, and L=last name. Note that all names were properly spelled and included in the reservation in the correct order. There were not typos or any missing information. There was no doubt about my identity. I have flown in numerous other airlines over decades with the same spelling without any problems. This has never been a problem anywhere anytime. But as the SAA manager said, ""SAA is different!"" He also informed me that I was not the only one with this problem as a university professor on the counter next to me argued the same case. He added later that it happens every day. Naturally, this is evidence of a problem with the airline policy.
After being denied boarding, my travel agent called SAA to reissue the ticket. SAA did not allow the ticket to be re-issued with the requested name change, but agreed to waive the fees if we bought a new, last minute ticket -- for a significant price increase, of course. Furthermore, cancelling the ticket would make me lose my seats and fall back to the end of the wait list. As a result, there were no seats available for the next 2 days and all return flights were sold out on the date of my return as well as +/- 2 days around the expected date of my return.
I was left with a very bitter taste. How many times will SAA screw me? A piece of advice: avoid SAA if you can.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/06/d4/18/zulumbi.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zulumbi,Zulumbi wrote a review Jul 2017,Zulumbi,"New York City, New York",15 contributions,23 helpful votes,Washington DC - Harare,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r498362468-South_African_Airways-World.html,Inefficiency at its worse,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I flew to Mauritius this month on SAA economy class. The plane was a new Airbus 360 and the flight was almost full. Seats were comfortable for Economy and the cabin service was efficient and friendly in both directions. Food was dull but typical of any airline's economy fare. In flight entertainment worked well (not always the case with SAA especially on their older planes) and their was a reasonable number of channels. I would fly this airline again on this route. I had to pay to pre-book a seat which was disappointing.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/32/d9/85/303gilesr.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/303gilesr,303gilesr wrote a review Jun 2017,303gilesr,"Johannesburg, South Africa",133 contributions,37 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r496440376-South_African_Airways-World.html,FLY TO MAURITIUS FROM JOHANNESBURG,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've been flying since I was 3 years old religiously almost 5-6times a year and this is the worst flight I have been on. The flight was dirty hadn't been cleaned properly, the tvs did not work and that's unacceptable for an 11-12 hour flight! Lastly the air hostess was very very rude... the lady sitting next to me complained about a number of things and his and her responses were that there were other airlines that she could pick to use and didn't have to be on this flight or fly with South African airways. That wasn't all she didn't eat something and had requested alternative food that didn't end up coming so she didn't have a hot meal instead had to eat the bread which was stale and being served while the best before date was two days ok.

"SAA has definitely deteriorated over the last couple of years. Their planes are often delayed and they over book their flights. If you are not some of the first people to check in they just let you know you can't catch the flight you've paid for and need to wait at the airport for the next available flight. ALL TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAPITALIZE 100% on each flight even if there's no shows(who would loose their money anyway for not pitching) They don't care about the customer but rather about the money- this was not an isolated event--- I have experienced this about 5 times, once on my way to a wedding.

"I am a relatively short person so leg room for me was not a great issue unless you are seated next to someone who is taller and they want to spread their legs over to your side so clearly leg room is not design for all heights. I am not over weight but the seat between me and my partner was extremely annoying as it would not go all the way down and rubbed on my thigh.

I was not too impressed with the food so it was hard for me to eat at all they are vegan friendly you just need to state this on your flights when booking. I came prepared with snacks on the plane to get me through the flight.

My screen on the back chair was not working and I understand that being so high up the sky these things are not going to run 100% so I was prepared with bringing my ipad and of course a pillow (this has saved comfort on so many flights) also if you can afford it invest in some sound cancellation headphones.

The customer service is pretty good and the few times that I have flown with SAA I have never had an issue. They will attend and provide the best they can for you I guess you need to be prepared for what a flight is like and keeping to yourself as other people will need more attendance.

Seats were so comfortable with sheep skins brought out in the evening to sleep on.  I never sleep on planes but I slept a full 8 hours. The service was great, the food was good.

I am probably one of the few to recommend an SAA flight but I enjoy the friendliness of the staff and the service. In flight entertainment was good. USB chargers on seats. The usual chicken or beef was served. Just check to make sure your flight wasn't cancelled on this route as there are two flights on a Saturday to Sao Paulo. They will combine in favor of the earlier flight if there isnt enough uptake and then you are stuck with a longer layover.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wikuse2014,Wikus E wrote a review Jun 2017,Wikus E,"Randburg, South Africa",233 contributions,31 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Sao Paulo,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r496252710-South_African_Airways-World.html,Comfortable,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was happy to find this direct flight with reasonable departure and arrival times. I booked early for a great price including an exit row. The flight ended up being delayed by an entire day - for which news we waited 2hours on the tarmac in NY.  The airline put us up in a hotel in Queens and offered us dinner and breakfast, but what a mess!   Totally disorganized and slow.  Buses were to come but again a long long wait so that many gave up and took cars.   Both to and from the hotel.  I guess they counted on this because they never did provide sufficient bus space.

"On a long flight such as this, comfort is a top priority.  The flight attendants were fantastic, the seats were spacious, and the food exceptional.  My only issue was that, after looking on Seat Guru, I opted for the last row of Business class rather than being in the front row of the cabin.  My mistake!

"SAA is definitely the best option from the U.S. to Johannesburg. With a nonstop flight from New York, which is just about 15 1/2 hours, you can't beat the schedule. Some other carriers have flight times of over 20 hours, which is just too much, after having to fly into New York to begin with.

Had a seamless check-in / boarding experience.

The on-board product was as expected... Seats were comfortable, with pretty good legroom (which is extremely important on such a long flight). At 5' 9"", I was even able to extend my feet easily (under the seat in front of me), and was comfy enough to get about 6-7 hours sleep.

Meals were excellent, and the inclusion of alcoholic beverages... winner!

"My husband & I were delayed when severe weather cancelled a flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg. We were put on another flight, but had concerns about our connecting flight back to the United States. We were absolutely assured that enough people had been delayed & they were holding the international flight. We were told someone would meet us to usher us quickly to the gate in Johannesburg. Nobody was there so we all sprinted for the gate on our own, only to find the flight had long since left. Had we known the truth, we could have potentially made alternate arrangements & certainly wouldn't have sprinted through the airport with our carry on in tow. We were lead in circles back & forth to several counters before an airport employee finally walked us to the right place to figure out what to do next. They weren't sure where our luggage was & blandly sent us on our way with a ticket for a hotel/meals (which were decent).  We did find our luggage & were re-scheduled for 24 hours later on another flight which meant  both a missed connection in the statues and missed work. No offer was made to upgrade seats, offer future travel vouchers, or anything of that nature. We had trouble contacting our connecting airline from Johannesburg so got up early & went right back to the airport to try to figure that out. We were assured by SAA hat this had already  'been sorted out' for us so we relaxed in our seats and enjoyed the flight back. (We would have slept in had they said this the night before) The planes are very comfortable and kept up nicely, & the staff is friendly. When we arrived in Washington DC, we were told that nothing had actually  been done with our connecting flight at all so we were 'no shows'. We did find another flight & worked this out fine---but had another 6 hours in an airport after traveling for about 50 hours total.

"Business or fist class has changed. Don't get me wrong as it sure beats economy, but let's discuss how spending $7000 plus has changed from a premier experience to a commodity where the airline has found a way to cram as many pods into a space that previously was reserved for a smaller number at a better price.

I must say that the service was outstanding and that is their best quality.

My seat was on the side, row 11, and I had a curved wall encroaching and squishing me for 17 hours. No menu other than a printed page with a summary read by the hostess. No internet access, not even close to land, and then there was the 3 minute let's love saa preview before I could watch a movie which was interrupted halfway with saa subliminal ads. Seriously.

They took away personal air vents and when it hit what felt like 90f somebody finally lowered the air. The complaint may have helped.

Sadly saa fisrt/business class is barely a step up from economy now and sadly does not compare with other international carriers at this price. And this is their new airbus.

The seat itself is wobbly until you recline it. The cushion may as well be a block of wood. Built to last long but zero comfort. They changed safety belts to include a car like shoulder strap. If you go down folks, this is not going to help, but for somebody as tall as me it is very uncomfortable.

SAA has figured out how to bring economy into first class at a hefty price to the passenger.

SAA.

"I must first admit that, as a South African, I have chosen not to fly on our national carrier, certainly never domestically. The reasons are that I cannot support a parastatal that hemorages tax payers money and whose board is chaired by a corrupt incompetent. Any ticket price is huge when I consider the loss of my taxes into the bottomless pit that is SAA. However, our recent trip from Johannesburg to New York using SAA made economic and time sense: we could find cheaper tickets but SAA flies directly and we needed to maximize our time in NYC. So let's begin with the negatives. The SAA website is counterintuitive and gave me, who flies often, a sense that my booking had been lost when I tried to check in slightly earlier than the 24 hours required. Instead of a clear statement informing me that 'checkin in not yet available, try again within 24 hours of your departure time' I was greeted by a red warning sign and icon stating that 'No record if this traveler is on the Database!"" This forced me to phone the airline to confirm that I was still in the system and that I still had a flight. This all seemed rather stressful and unnecessary for a first-time SAA traveler. We received confirmation emails of our boarding passes on the out leg but NOT any communication and digital boarding passes for our return journey. This meant that more time was needed to check in at JFK as I could provide no proof of pre-check in. Given the delays in passing through USA ports security this was unwelcome. There is no possibility of ordering or changing your meal as this is not provided for on the website and, to ensure that my wife and I sat together, an extra fee of R500 was charged - just to sellect seats. I consider this a cheek given the high costs of the seat you pay for in the 1st place. The seats on this long haul flight are appalling and I needed to place 2 cushions on the seat to help me cope with what felt like a plate of metal with a piece of thin foam on top. Clearly the seats have passed their expiration date as have the screens and hardware which are decades old and difficult to manipulate. Given that we had flown Delta inside the USA whose entertainment touch-screen hardware is state of the art, I can see that my taxes and expensive flight costs are not finding their way to fleet maitainance. My wife's handset did not function and the old touch screen technology and time lag was frustrating. On both our legs to and from the USA no flight pack was provided and this sloppiness added to the sense that SAA long haul is operating by the seat of its pants. But there are upsides. Our flights left on time and we arrived ahead of schedule coming home. Our vegetarian menus were catered for timeously, the flight crew and attendants were friendly and helpful with all our needs and requests. The selection of in-house entertainment was surprisingly wide - although hampered by the aforementioned old technology.

"The service was excellent on the outward leg of my journey, however, at least a third of the in-flight entertainment devices didn't work (mine being one of them).  On the way back the in-flight entertainment devices again didn't work (at least I had a working screen this time).  Staff on this flight was less polite.  I don't think there is any brand awareness.

I traveled round trip on South African Airways and was impressed by their ability to keep flight departures/arrivals on time.

The Airbus they fly from Livingstone to Johannesburg is a spacious comfortable plane and one of the best domestic or regional business class sections I have ever sat in!

The connecting flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town was on one of their older Boeing 737's which are tired and nowhere near as comfortable or spacious as the first flight. But the service was incredibly good and of course the flight was safe and on time.

"This travel was related to a medical mission for a Global Health Institute, and alternative carriers for the route included Emirates and Turkish Air, either one of which would have been strongly preferable. Two medical students were travelling with four extra pieces of luggage for medical purposes. Online seating and checkin was virtually impossible, and after two lengthy phone calls with customer service, our family member (daughter) arrived at the airport without seats for a 20 hour flight. While SAA website shows $50 for an extra piece of baggage, they were charged $800 for 4. SAA insisted that a credit card had been declined which was blatantly untrue. While it was eventually sorted out, one doesn't need this type of stress facing a 20 hr flight. Nor is it cost-effective administration.

"My husband  and  I  went to  South Africa  on holiday  to spend time  with  my children  and  grandchildren.  We stopped  for 2 nights in Johannesburg  and arrived at O R Tambo to board our flight to Durban . We stood  in the queue to check in and noticed  that most of the check in desk was without  staff, the ones that  were in operation operation was absolutely slow, We then tried  to do self booking  on their terminal  but it would not print  the boarding  pass and no staff around to  help so my   husband  who was waiting  in the Queue came over to  call  me  because  it was my turn and the moment  we handed out tickets and passports to the  check in  staff she immediately  said that  the  gates are closed  and we must purchase  another ticket for the next flight. The time was around 3:15 - 3:20 for the 4:00 flight which we were told  the gates are closed.We were then told to wait until 4:15 and then proceed to customer service desk to purchase tickets for the 5:00 flight . This ticket was purchased  at 4:30 and we went through the boarding gates after 4:30 , this puzzles me because  the earlier flight was closed at 3:15 but the next flight was not closed at 4:15 how does that work.

"As SAA is the only airline that offers direct flights between Perth and South Africa you are stuck with them and they know it. This is plainly obvious when looking at the costs. It cost me more to fly the 10 hours to Johannesburg in March this year than it costs me for my 23 hour flight to LA last month and if you try and book over the peak periods it will cost you even more.

Check in is slow at Johannesburg International - although I will not blame SAA for this - as the customs queues take forever.

There is a great selection of duty free items for sale in the departures terminal and at reasonable prices.

I must compliment about half of the staff on my recent flight as they really went all out to ensure the customers (passengers) were as comfortable as possible and appeared to enjoy assisting no matter what time they were approached. Unfortunately the other half of the crew were definitely not in the same class and made you feel like they were doing you a favour by just being on the plane. They definitely let their counterparts down.

The seats are you average economy class size but are extremely hard which really hurts after a few hours in the air. I ended up sitting on my travel (neck) pillow to soften the ride.

The entertainment is up to standard with a good selection of both recent and hit movies to choose from as well as interesting documentary's on areas in SA to visit.

The flight was smooth as was take off and landing.

Another positive was that all my luggage was on the carousel with nothing missing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5422NNrichardw,Richard W wrote a review May 2017,Richard W,"Perth, Australia",86 contributions,15 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r487617201-South_African_Airways-World.html,Mixed staff attitudes!!,Date of travel: March 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Clean plane, smiling crew, wonderful new seat with these thing that wrap around your neck, excellent video system and no nonsense.  Loved it.  I think they could improve their check in at the airport.  After being asked for bribes by three cops, the guy who opened the door and some nice man who walked up and grabbed my bags (I grabbed them back), I got to the counter.  I asked about upgrades to business class. The lady said none were available.  I was willing to pay top dollar just to be horizontal for the short flight to JBG, but nope, SAA did not want my money.  And I was shocked when I got on the plane to observe over 75% of business class totally empty.  I'm not sure what their business model is, but this flight was clearly a loss leader when it did not have to be.  When someone says they want to pay for an upgrade to business, let them!!!

"Like many other airlines, S A airways are continually downgrading in-flight and lounge facilities to save money. Unfortunately staff traning has also gone for a loop. When checking in at King Shaka on the first leg of our journey to Mauritius via Johannesburg, we found the Business class check-in staff unfriendly, tired, no welcome, no smiles. We were told that the Business class luggage limit of 32 kg per piece does not apply to the domestic part of our flight. Huh ? ( my case weighed 26kg). When I showed the attendant my ticket which shows the limit as 32 kg, she frowned and just gave me our boarding passes. The ""lounge"" at King Shaka has a very limited food offering, especially in the mornings.
The return flight from Mauritius was on one of the smaller S. A. planes. Business Class seats were barely okay.....the seats have been made extra thin, almost no padding. More comfortable than a Putco bus, but not much. The more you pay for Business class the less you get.
The Business class lounge in Mauritius puts the South African lounge to shame.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SvB-CvB,SvB-CvB wrote a review May 2017,SvB-CvB,Umhlanga,99 contributions,91 helpful votes,Durban - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r486143004-South_African_Airways-World.html,Getting worse,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have taken this up extensively on Twitter and eventually forced a phone call out of SAA.
SAA, as a state owned enterprise, that is regularly bailed out by government, is a national disaster. Owing to government protection, SAA doesn't have to worry about markets or customers - and it shows.
Our flight was due to board at 13h25. By 14h00 (departure time) we were still standing the in the queue, with none of the passengers any the wiser as to the delay, until someone notice there was a problem with the plane's front wheels...
After the crowd starting grumbling, we were advised that the flight was delayed...
We were told that boarding would not likely take place before 15h00. Note, please, that OR Tambo is a silent airport and there are limited flight information announcements.
We went off for something to eat and returned to the boarding gate at 14h45 only to find that the flight had departed!
We found ourselves, along with several other passengers, stranded.
We were able to get ourselves booked on another flight, after much palaver and argument, particularly with the particularly abrasive ground crew member who'd been at the centre of the debacle. Luggage retrieval, given luggage had been offloaded, was another ridiculous and unpleasant mockery.
The Australian couple who also missed the flight and who we assisted where dumbfounded and horrified.
I took to Twitter and received the brush off until I resorted to including others in my tweets and retweeting to Star Alliance and Voyager partners. The apology, when it came was an ""however"" sort of apology, which resulted in another bout of tweeting, at which point I was finally asked for my phone number and received a call from one of the social media managers, who was good enough to listen to my complaint, concur that all had gone wrong, and apologised.
But honestly, to go to that length to extract an apology - no compensation offered - is nothing short of dismal.
It also created an unpleasant end to what had been a great holiday.

As an aside, food on SAA is awful. Flight attendents are generally good.

The only good experience in the whole horrible experience was the incredibly lovely lady at the check in desk, when we were obliged to re-check in. Top marks to her for an outstanding attitude. The rest of the SAA ground crew could well learn several lessons from her.

If you can avoid flying SAA, do so.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalgran,kalgran wrote a review May 2017,kalgran,Cape Town,491 contributions,144 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r485294692-South_African_Airways-World.html,A b*****y nightmare!,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We recently visited Mauritius for a family holiday. We booked business class as a treat. The trip to Mauritius was excellent and the business class facilities were what you would have expected, in flight entertainment, lie flat seats etc. Unfortunately the flight back was an experience that bordered on a scam. The plane back was a small plane and the business class section was nothing  more than a economy seat with a tad more leg room, the entertainment system was an ipad with a couple of movies on and the food was the same as economy. At no point during the booking process was this pointed out to us. We questioned the Purser on the flight about this and to be honest their attitude was shocking and aggressive basically telling people they had the option to get off if they wanted. Bottom line watch out for this scam on SAA international flights.

Told by SAA to go to the airport at 08:00 a.m. to book onto the next day flight. Hotel told us to go at 06:00 a.m. to increase our chances of getting on the flight. Got there early and we got seats but only because they bumped people off the flight who hadn't checked in early. Numerous others who were supposed to be on the flight didn't make it either. Ground staff were very unhelpful and personally I would not recommend SAA. Had further problems on a later flight and again ground staff ere very unhelpful.

"I flew to sa in Jan. Received a call night before stating that the airline has overbooked and I will be flying on a different flight. I was informed that as per regulations I will be compensated.

With that I sent through information of flight etc to their email as per my correspondence and them and rearranged my trip to airport.

The flight was below standard. The armrest was broken with the metal digging into my skin. But I'm used to flying budget airlines for much less than I paid SAA for.

No issues flying back. Flew with my mum who is their voyager traveller.

Since Jan SAA have not sent through any correspondence regarding the compensation. I sent an email to inform them that I have not been contacted. I resent all relevant details. I still have not even received an email of acknowledgement. I have even sent an email to their complaints department and have not received correspondence.

"I have mixed feelings about SAA, currently. And I'm certain its the fault of senior management.

Bad:
It seems like there is a lack of maintenance on the planes lately. The media screens on the flights to AND from Accra didn't work properly - screen changes colour, audio doesn't work, remote control didn't work.

Good:
Despite the odd passenger getting sick (one passenger on each flight that I know of - not the airlines fault at all), staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, and pleasant. I take my hat off to the cabin crew! I can only imagine what they have to put up with.

"This was our 6th business class flight with SAA since mid February and up until now they've all been better than expected.  However,  the gremlins certainly set in early on this trip - we went to the JHB business lounge and were unable to find a seat - there were customers complaining at reception,  all to no avail but luckily we're PP members and so able to access other lounges (recommend the Bidvest lounge) - not a great start.  We were told it was due to flight delays as a result of a cabin crew strike but when asked,  were told our flight was on schedule.  This turned out to be far from true and the first we knew was from our flight app and only later courtesy of an SAA email!!  Initial delay was one and a half hours and on boarding there was another delay due to missing connecting passengers!  Arrived in London over 2hrs late in the end.  The onboard service was sadly lacking and the food average - the senior? Attendant in business - David - saved the day by his efforts and so he dragged my score up 1 - so good on him!  There was absolutely no communication from staff at the airport and when I heard all the other grumbles from customers on their experiences with SAA it's no wonder they're bankrupt.  All in all a complete shambles but at least we were able to lay out and sleep - I felt sorry for those in economy.  I'll think twice before flying SAA in the future,  which is a shame and purely due to what I can only call staff incompetence - or maybe they just don't care?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/ce/dd/bf/nnmercman.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nnmercman,nnmercman wrote a review Apr 2017,nnmercman,"Camberley, United Kingdom",13578 contributions,1566 helpful votes,Johannesburg - London,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r479462976-South_African_Airways-World.html,From hero to nearly zero...,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It had been a long time since I had flown with South African Airways. I was surprised by the upgraded plane and flight entertainment on offer compared to my last time traveling. The cabin crew we polite and friendly on the first leg of the journey. On arriving in Johannesburg and transferring to a domestic plane, the quality of the plane on this leg was much lower and the flight attendants not very friendly or helpful. Quite the opposite to the international leg.
Overall the positives were a quick flight time. Good entertainment and excellent staff on the international leg.
Negative points, the food on the return leg Johannesburg to Cape Town was awful and the cabin at the back of the plane very very cold. Three blankets and still feeling it.

Flew business Perth to Jo'burg.  When it was announced in the lounge (SAA business passengers have use of the Qantas lounge which was very busy and in need of a refurb but staff did a great job clearing tables and replenishing food etc) that the aircraft was boarding we headed for the gate and were last to board - so no queuing!  Aircraft left slightly ahead of schedule and landed early.  Departure was around midnight so a long overnight haul of 11hrs or so - I slept most of the way so didn't notice the time. Business seating was 2-2-2 configuration so better than BA which has 4 in the middle.  Beds are almost fully flat but feet can dangle a bit off the end if you're around 6 foot.  Ideally you need more than one duvet to lay on as the seats were hard when extended (not a problem as business was only about half full).  Food menu wasn't extensive but being a late flight most passengers would have already eaten.  Service was attentive and staff friendly.  So far we've only flown business on SAA - this is our 5th since February and currently transiting in Jo'burg for 15hrs (staying in the transit hotel which is quiet and comfortable - superior rooms are larger and also have a bath plus shower) until the connection to London.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/ce/dd/bf/nnmercman.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nnmercman,nnmercman wrote a review Apr 2017,nnmercman,"Camberley, United Kingdom",13578 contributions,1566 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r479028054-South_African_Airways-World.html,Ahead of schedule!,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The trip did not start off well when we sat on the tarmac in NYC due to bad weather.  Almost 2 hours and nothing was served, no entertainment, just occasional updates from the pilot.Once again, when we did get up in the air, the entertainment system did not work for half of the plane.  It was ""rebooted"" from time to time, but it did not help.  This was my second trip with SAA when the system didn't work correctly.  On a 14 hour fight, it is essential.

Seeing though it was my first time flying business class it was a truly wonderful experience for me.

"Whilst this review is for economy class we also did 1 leg at Business Class from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls.  All 3 flights were on time, seats in economy class we paid a little extra for Exit row seats i.e. no seats n front of us & only 2 seats.  The seats were extremely uncomfortable with little to no padding.  Flight stewards were indifferent & performed their role but with little to no smiles personality.  Food served on the plane was not a great standard, particularly breakfast where the option for a egg dish was gone by the time they reached us with the trolley.  All that was on offer was cold meats - we went without, not my idea of breakfast.  Overall disappointing, whilst on time there are other areas that could be improved.  I won't be using this airline again after the 3 flights we took.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricY674,Eric Y wrote a review Apr 2017,Eric Y,"Brisbane, Australia",70 contributions,68 helpful votes,Perth - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r477302343-South_African_Airways-World.html,"3 Flights, 1 Business & 2 Economy",Date of travel: March 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We are flying with SAA purely because there are not many other options available to our destination. It is now the 3rd time I have been flying in a short space of time that the in flight entertainment did not work. This happened flying Business and Economy. You pay a lot of money and expect these basic services. No consistency in On Board service from flight attendants (some are very friendly and and others less so). Food is average. Loyalty program Voyager  not the best. It is very difficult to upgrade  tickets using your points.  If you contact them via e-mail they are slow to respond. To summarise if you fly with them take your own in flight entertainment to be safe. They are not the worst airline to fly with but if you have alternative options available I would recommend that you consider those seriously.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/8e/f3/2a/rvdw2015.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rvdw2015,rvdw2015 wrote a review Apr 2017,rvdw2015,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria",24 contributions,5 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Lagos,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r476711888-South_African_Airways-World.html,In flight entertainment problematic,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Just finished five flights on SAA.  Two long International flights, JFK-JNB and reverse.  One was fine, the other barely acceptable.  Lie flat seats are very uncomfortable even with the mattress pad and comforter.  Leg room is quite good.  A340-600 aircraft seems old and tired.  Crew service spotty-some outstanding while others were rude and off putting.  Food is not very good.  Good selection of movies.  Three internal flights, two on prop jets were as expected with very good service with a smile.  Be aware that transfers in Johannesburg are complicated with little helpful information available.

"We were booked in to fly to Rio via Sao Paulo. On arrival in Rio none of the South African traveller's luggage had arrived. Two hours later we received confirmation that it is still in Sao Paulo. The next day we had to wait at our hotel until 15.00 when it was eventually delivered. The wrapping was torn off, the locks were broken and the suitcases were opened. Several personal items were removed and the plastic wrapping was stuffed inside to fill up the suitcases. We sent a report to SAA regarding the incident but are still waiting after 2 weeks. On our return flight from Buenos Aires to our luggage was once again been tampered with. The new lock on one of the suitcases was again broken off and the zipper was stripped beyond repair. We are still waiting for a response from the airline.

Do not book with South African Airways if there is even the slightest chance you need to amend a name on a booking. I have a flight for 4 people in 1 months time. Due to illness one passenger cannot fly. As I result I called to amend simply the name (happy to pay a change fee) and was told it was against their policy in any circumstance. My option is to go with 3 people and waste the flight and accommodation cost for the 4th or lose the entire value of the trip.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2012Travel2012,2012Travel2012 wrote a review Apr 2017,2012Travel2012,London,4 contributions,5 helpful votes,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r476346083-South_African_Airways-World.html,Cannot change a name on a ticket,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight 237 was poor, other 3 average. On 237 food was hot and edible (non meat choice) and well served. No hot drinks available dinner and breakfast because of turbulence. What I found unacceptable was the cabin crew. No water was offered during this night flight, 1 lady was shouted at for daring to open a window shutter. The worse was the WC's not being maintained for the entire flight. 1 hand basin full of used soapy water, another ran out of paper and all dirty by arrival.

On check-in we were directed to Board at gate A15. About 5min before boarding we were told go to gate A25 which is about 10min walk from where we were. Arriving at gate A25 after standing waiting for the SAA Staff to aarive we were again told to move to gate A23. Can you imagin moving 200 passengers at a time from one side to the other. Needless to say they moved us again to A27 where we boarded. This was already late. When asking the SAA Staff you just get attitude from them not even trying to explain why. If I had a choice I would not fly SAA but I do not have one as they have the monopoly on this route and you pay same rate of +- R5200 return which is the same you can fly to Europe from Johannesburg. SAA needs to come right. Further on arrival in Lusaka I noticed that my bags/luggage were soaking wet when I collected it from the baggage carousel. It was raining in Johannesburg so again we do not care about other people and their bags.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/03/d3/fd/pieter-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356pieterb,Pieter B wrote a review Apr 2017,Pieter B,"Kempton Park, South Africa",74 contributions,13 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Lusaka,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729155-r475437552-South_African_Airways-World.html,SA62 dated 13 April 2017 What a Bad experience,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
