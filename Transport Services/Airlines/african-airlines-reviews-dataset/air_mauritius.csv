"Before our holiday I had read lots of bad reviews with regard to customer service and was worried what our flight would be like.  All I can say is whole experience was very good.  We found the seats comfortable, pillows and blankets supplied were soft and warm and the small bag handouts containing some useful items a nice touch.  We were lucky the plane was not full so plenty of free seats available which is always a bonus especially on a night flight.We took off around 23.00 and had an evening meal served which was chicken or pasta.  The chicken was tasty, you had a choice of red or white wine, beer or soft drink.  Wine was topped up and then tea or coffee.  Water was offered a couple of times through the night or you could press the overhead call button and someone appeared almost instantly.Breakfast was served in the morning which was also enjoyable.  The cabin crew were all very friendly and it made for a very pleasant flight.

"DO NOT BOOK TICKETS WITH AIR MAURITIUS!!!!

You have been warned. If you are considering booking direct with them, refrain and rather book with a more reputable company.

We were denied boarding because they said my Two year old passport was defaced (she scribbled over an insignifcant area of her passport). Even though she was refused by the checking desk (as immigration concluded that they were happy to except), they refuse to let the other 5 people on the booking to fly.

We are out of pocket massively.
Customer service is poor- they effectively started to ignore my emails.

No mediation services.
Effectively if you have a complaint, they will ignore you and you have no recourse with a mediation body.

Save yourself the hassle and book with a company that believes in fairness, and one that you can challenege if they mess up.

I am not the only one who has come across this problem with their complaints handling- Check previous reviews.

I was shown my seat in Business Class & was blown away by the decor used, colour etc. totally on point as was the seating, utter luxury and comfort.

It was so great to have a little place of heaven on this aircraft and I just relaxed completely and had almost enjoyable flight.

The food & beverages that were served were absolutely of the highest standard & utterly delicious.

"I have not experienced such poor service or uninterested staff on any other flight.
Ignoring the fact that our return flight was cancelled by Air Mauritius without any email communication or any alternative being offered.
We took the 16.20 flight on 14 August from CDG direct to Mauritius. As a family we had a row of 3 seat in row 33 with my mum being in row 31 with extra leg room. First the flight attendant told her that she couldn’t store her water to the side of the seat, no problem, but didn’t tell her where she could then came back and said I have told you before you can’t leave that there in a rather loud and condescending voice, snatched the bottle from her and placed it out of reach (we had no idea how happy we would be to have that bottle later)
There was no drinks service on board and in fact the meal was served within 2hrs of take off, with no drinks offered before or after so that was the one chance for a beverage. During the flight you had to go to the galley and ask for water, which was provided in a cup that was only half full, as if it was being rationed and it was clear that the staff resented the interruption. There were no other soft drinks available. As the staff were not forthcoming with drinks this made the aisle very busy as everyone was up and down to the galley.
Breakfast was served about 90 minutes before landing and all the baked goods were either stale or still cold/partly frozen.
The young girl in the seat next to my mum started to vomit, and the staff did not offer any assistance or sick bags, until they were called.
It appeared as if anything asked of the cabin crew was an inconvenience.
We had booked with Air France but the flight was operated by Air Mauritius, but the price was higher booking with them direct that through AF.

"I love flying Air Mauritius, but the food is just inedible. Stale bread, pastries, powered eggs, sausages that are so processed they are practically nuclear in composition. No cheese, no yoghurt - everything processed and sugared: processed creamer, jam, squashed jam pastry, unripened fruit.

"Having flown out to Mauritius in business we flew home in economy and it was the same as every other economy flight.

The staff were very friendly. The drinks were plentiful. The food was typical economy aeroplane food but it was very nice.

"We flew direct with Air Mauritius from London Heathrow to Mauritius and upgraded to business class at the airport (cheaper than when booking) and it was so so worth it. I would highly recommend for such a long flight. You get access to an airport lounge, priority boarding, champagne/juice upon boarding, a lovely vanity kit from Porsche, the seats are wider and convert to lie flat beds with a quilt and pillow, canapes, 3 course meal (which was absolutely delicious) and just generally an all-round much much better and comfortable experience which is needed for a 12-hour flight, especially as it is an overnight flight. We flew home in economy and it was the same as every other economy flight, however, there was minimal films/TV programmes and the seats recline further than most planes so when the person in front reclines you have very little space. I loved in both classes that there is a camera so you can see what the captain can see, very fun to watch take off and landing.

"We are frequent travellers and used many airlines for both short and long-haul flights.   On this occassion we feel it necessary to make other potential passengers aware of what to expect with Air Mauritius travelling Economy.    I only booked with them as they currently offer a direct flight from Heathrow, and I opted to travel from Shropshire (circa 3 hours) for the convenience.   However, the level of comfort is poor at the very best.   It was impossible to move and use the tray in front when seats are reclined.   Subsequently, if you have a passenger in-front who wishes to fully recline their seat, you're trapped!   The tray is rendered useless and it is impossible to use to eat or (in my case) to use a small laptop.   We were offered two choices of food, one 1/2 hour in the flight, the other, circa 45 mins before landing.   No refreshments were offered for cica 8 hours and no facility to self-serve.  Refreshments were offered (one) at meal times.   I opted for a cup of tea - it was basically hot water and I had to ask the cabin crew for a replacement. However, it seemed perfectly acceptable to them to serve what they had without a care that it contained.    Don't buy the in-flight wifi!!   Mine lasted 30 minutes into the flight to simply check emails and then was prompted to pay a further £20 (approx.) as I had supposedly ran out of data, despite not downloading or streaming anything.  The wifi speed was terrible.   It was truly a disastrous 13 hour experience from take-off to landing, one I have never experienced before in around 30 years of flying.    Even more annoying was when I relayed my concerns to their ""Customer Service"" Team in Mauritius by email.   In fairness, they acknowledged receipt, asked for information they could have easily obtained from the information provided in my initial email, and then didn't bother to respond back despite sending two further emails.   I am not one of those people who complain for the sake of, and this is the first time I have ever left a negative review for an Airline.   My advice to any UK traveller is to avoid this airline as they clearly have no interest in the customers' experience.  They had an opportunity to at least acknowledge and investigate my complaint, but clearly are not bothered.    A disgrace to the name ""Mauritius"" as it's a beautiful country and great people.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveR501,Steve R wrote a review Jul 2022,Steve R,,4 contributions,3 helpful votes,London - Rodrigues Island,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r846835145-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Customer Services Ignore You & In-Flight Food/Seat Pitch & Wifi TERRIBLE,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was so pleasantly surprised with the high standard set by the crew and staff of this airline. Well done. There was a bit of a delay on our return flight with getting onboard the aircraft and I could tell some passengers were getting antsy. But the staff remaind friendly and attentive and we eventually departed without any significant delays. Our departure from Mauritius did also have an issue with our digital boarding passes not being read by the scanner. So we ended up having to wait with everyone else in the looooong queue to get a printed version. If they could upgrade their scanners at the airport, that would be a massive help.

"My issue with airlines currently isn't aimed specifically at air mauritius but at the industry as a whole. Air Mauritius were fine but nothing special. They were certainly better than some other national airlines I have flown but they in no way excelled.

The positives were in the service and the crew, they were prompt, attentive, polite and pleasant.

The negatives lay in the food and in flight entertainment. In economy you expect a certain level of food which is not very high, in this case even those expectations were not met. It takes a lot for me to not finish a meal, especially when I was as hungry as I was but I just couldn't stomach it.

Most of the inflight options weren't available from the entertainment station which wouldn't be a problem during an overnight flight, had sleeping been at all possible. I gave up and started watching a film but for me, there really wasn't that much choice.

Pre and early flight it was frustrating that every few minutes announcements were being made. I fully understand why these have to be done but it was very frustrating to have one announcement finish, and then 30 seconds later another would start, or it would be repeated in another language. This meant constantly removing and replacing headphones or having to pause conversations having only just restarted them.

My advice would be to either space them out more or do them seamlessly so as not to constantly Interupt people.

There was also a pre flight delay that was never communicated in any way until after everyone had boarded which was slightly annoying

Over all though given all thenissues around flying right now this experience could have been a lot worse.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/24/16/52/fb/twa-hozza.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twa_Hozza,Tom wrote a review Jun 2022,Tom,"Crowthorne, United Kingdom",27 contributions,3 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r843534773-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Above average during a difficult time,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Couple. originally booked economy, had the offer to bid for an upgrade(flight from Heathrow)which we got, on hindsight think we bid to high. The flight itself was very good, staff were friendly. The seats have different settings down to a flat bed, and manage to sleep.
FOOD. The menu was very good however, bearing in mind there are 28 seats total
we were two seats from the back. When the stewardess arrived only had spicy food left, hubby was ok but I can't eat its so I just ate the fruit . 10 minutes later the stewardess came back with a tuna pasta for me, guessing she got it from economy.

The staff at check in, both ways were very friendly and very efficient. Thankyou.

So a big thankyou to her (sorry forgot your name.)
Breakfast. scrambled eggs or pancakes in syrup. No Scrambled eggs left. Pancakes was sickly, yuk so had bits of fruit for to eat. Basically a big let down.

We travelled home economy, seats were comfy, staff friendly , food typical economy.
As it was a 12 hour flight could of had a better selection on the inflight entertainment

"Told to pull the blinds down on take-off - ""its CAA regulations"" - really?  Never heard that before.  Ditto when the sun rose in the morning - although it was 07.00 Mauritius time - hardly early!   Same excuse ""Its CAA regulations"".  Has anyone heard about these so-called regulations or are the staff just trying to keep the passengers asleep for an easy life?  The wearphones were a joke - they don't go loud enough to block out the sounds in the cabin so basically the whole entertainment system is in accessable unless you took your own quality earphones.  1/10 Air Mauritius!  Food was complicated and bland - and so many things they wouldn't really go on the table - has anyone in this airline actually tried to eat this food in an actual crowded aeroplane?  A sandwich would have been so much better.  One wine - you're done!  One coffee small - you're done!  The stewardess marched down the aisle so fast asking if anyone wanted another nobody could get one!  I'm so sorry we are interupting your classy life jetting all over the World, showing off to your friends in Mauritius who can't live like you.  This was like a reality show where we were the victims - and the staff are tasked with trying to do the least amout of work.  My wife was given her meal so far ahead of mine she was completely finished well before I was served - what the hell is going on with this Airline - is nobody checking what's happening?   The toilets were dreadful towards the end nearing London - they'd never been cleaned, two were out of service - the two next to the galley and staff - why am I not surprised - so there were queues of up to 10 people waiting in the last two hours.

I have even phoned the Visa and Passport department in Mauritius, and they also did not know about this rule.  I addressed this with Air Mauritius, and were told that they have escalated the matter to JHB Airport and will get back to me.

"We recently flew from Johannesburg to Mauritius return. Our flight out was fine (although the detailed requirements for travel to Mauritius mean lengthy queues in the airport as Air Mauritius staff attempt to deal with it all). This was poorly managed - they should explore ways where travelers can submit information before they fly to expedite this unnecessary paperwork.
Our return flight was a disaster. The flight was 30% overbooked and despite trying to check in 26 hours ahead of travel (and confirming our booking and selecting seats 5 days before), we were on standby which made for a stressful time. The airport in Mauritius was chaos and it was very difficult to find anyone to assist us. We did eventually make the flight but couldn't be seated together and it was a frustrating experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/22/da/be/e9/frommysuitcase.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frommysuitcase,Sue wrote a review Apr 2022,Sue,"Johannesburg, South Africa",20 contributions,3 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r834167129-Air_Mauritius-World.html,"Comfortable planes, overbooked flight",Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Due to Covid pos result, I had to move my flight. The agent at Air Mauritius said I had to pay an extra Rs2000 odd to change my flight. I told the agent I was insured for such an event. I was told that AM did not entertain such insurance and that I should deal with my insurance provider. She said she would investigate and revert, which she did not do. On confirming seat reservation the day prior to leaving, was told by new agent that I was not on the flight. To get onto the flight, I now had to cough up an extra Rs8395. As a Kestril member, I am shocked at AM's treatment of its faithful client. How on earth can AM expect my patronage moving forward?

"We were desperately looking to get away somewhere after being fully vaccinated, and the opening of Mauritius's resort only stay option looked quite appealing. Air Mauritius wasn't operating from London yet, so we connected via Paris, CDG. We were impressed by the Airbus 350 put in service for the CDG to MRU route. The economy seats have ample leg room and good entertainment systems (though ours were having issue due to system not being reset for most part of the journey). Also it being a overnight flight, I was impressed that they are still providing sleeping materials like pillows and blankets.

"I took my flight from Paris on 6th december to come to Mauritius but i was very disappointed with this airline and ita staff.
Am a resident of Mauritius but feel ashamed of how the staff of Air Mauritius was.
Initially i was coming from italy to mauritius so i had connecting flight in paris so once i reached paris i was waiting for my flight to mauritius the staff of air mauritius told me i cannot board the flight as i had my baby one month old and she did not had swap test done
I was surprised and angry as well i was left there at the airport of paris with my one month old baby
I had to pay and stay in hotel for one week then i had to make my one old month baby do the swap test so i could come back home and my luggages as well were damaged and i never got any claim back and when you call the airlines office there is no response
Also most of the air hotess are very lazy and not helpful at all
They dont even help you to put your luggages up i had so many difficulties as i was travelling alone with my one month old baby
They dont offer you any help instead other passengers were helping me
I will not take this Mauritius airline again am so so disappointed with this airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirty2497,Kirty wrote a review Feb 2021,Kirty,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Paris - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r782559849-Air_Mauritius-World.html,My trip to mauritius,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The cabin crew is very helpful and friendly.
The little gift given to all passengers on all flights, a pouch containing some travel essentials, was very nice.

I used the same airline to return to Mauritius and I had an equally enjoyable flight and good service.

The only thing I regret is that the seats are not large enough.

I was then told that there are only a certain number of seats available for a points upgrade. I asked how many and was informed that the information cannot be shared!!

"We were nearly landing in Mauritius when the plane diverted to Madagascar due to a cyclone. Air Mauritius provided shuttles to an Ibis hotel, covered all the buffet meals while we were there (and accommodation). There was a lack of shuttle buses so many people had to wait long periods to reach the hotel. We took a taxi and paid ourselves, which was a great idea. The room and food was arranged without us requesting it, so we're grateful for that.

Communication was good in terms of catching a flight the next day to Mauritius. Legroom was good on the flight. The food was inedible, which is my only complaint. Airline staff was lovely, friendly and accommodating.

We flew Johannesburg via Mauritius to Mahe. We only had 4 days in Mahe. Airline lost two of our bags. i understand this happens but what bothers me is the customer service of ground staff in Mahe is awful. They were just cursing and being terribly rude to passenger. Rather than reassure passengers that they are doing the best to get our bags they were just being rude and obnoxious. The airline needs to train it ground staff at Mahe about customer service and teach them some basic manners. They did'nt fly us for free we paid for our tickets dont be rude and have a f@#k off attitude. I was more annoyed with the ground staff manners than them losing my bags. We booked island tours and we had to cancel with no refunds. We always wanted to travel to Mahe but Air Maurituis ruined our holiday. When we eventually got the bags 3 days later we had to drive to airport to pick up. Terrible airline awful service. Going back flight delayed for 2.5 hours. Because we were 4 travelling they refused to let us take our hand luggage with us.

"I normally use Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines. Since we are visiting a friend in Kenya, a friend recommended Air Mauritius. I never had problems with luggage and hand carry etc. I bought a walking stick/cane made of ebony for my father in law and this was packaged well. We have limit of 30 kilos and mine just 16 kilos, the cane was under a kilo or so. We got to the counter to check in. I was told that I will need to pay extra for it unless we attach the cane to the luggage (as I am apparently only alowed 1 check in bag) and this cost 3000 KES to attach it to the luggage. I asked if I can take it as hand carry and was told no, for security reasons.
We had to make a decision to leave the cane with the security. The security was surprised as the item had no issue with the security and the cane went through the x-ray machine.
I have asked passengers with multiple bags and was told they didn't have to pay extra for theirs. I am just heart broken.
I have travelled with other airlines and never had this problem. I will never fly with these guys again.

"I was pleased to see they have finally updated their planes but I found the overall service quite lacking.
First of all, some of the staff in the outbound flight were quite rude. I called an assistant to ask for water but due to the engine noise it's quite difficult to hear. I tried to repeat but he just walked away while I was still talking.
The return flight seemed like an horror movie: 1 hour from departure they started serving food; after a few minutes a woman starts shouting for help. The husband's face was a contorted grimace. Luckily there was a doctor onboard to treat him, but Air Mauritius staff were helpless. The doctor told them off a few times.
Didn't help that after a few minutes another passenger felt unwell. People started to worry there was something wrong. The staff made no effort whatsoever to reassure the other passengers.

Fortunately we made it all the way home albeit almost 1 hour late. When the plane stopped and the seat belt sign went off people started to get their stuff to get out.
After 10 minutes an irate stewardess told us to seat down. Apparently the NHS had to get onboard before we could get out. If they had told us before we would have waited.

Cherry on top of the cake, we found ALL OUR FOUR luggage had been left back in Mauritius, despite having checked-in more than 2 hours before the flight.
We got our luggage back after 3 day, all battered and with the content wet.

Needless to say I'll avoid Air Mauritius in future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivanovingiani,ivanovingiani wrote a review Jan 2020,ivanovingiani,"London, United Kingdom",19 contributions,,Mahebourg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r737506243-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Upgraded planes but poor service,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My connection to Nairobi from Mauritius was cancelled about two months before I travelled and I was not informed about it.

The overnight stay was at the TERRIBLE Hennesey Park Hotel - no hot water for showers, staff couldn't care less and awful vegetarian food.

"I cannot describe how awful the customer service has been from Air Mauritius. I am livid. I fly a lot with many other airlines but working with them is truly awful and I would recommend to fly with another airline if possible and pay extra!

I booked flight for my mum, aunt and uncle last week and my aunt noticed I misspelt her name (as we know her as something else opposed to what is on her passport) I called to make the name change and they kept me hanging for a few hours to let me know what the penalty would be. I had to call them a few hours later as they hadn't followed up.To cut a very long story short, its been a week, the name still hasn't beeb changed and depending who I speak to on the phone, i owe them either GBP 16 to GBP 400. My aunt is very anxious waiting and concerned how much adding 5 letters to an electronic ticket is going to cost. I almost feel like they are fobbing me off so they can add more cost to this case.

"I don't know where to start as there is a lot of things to say!! Badly need to improve!First of all, I called several times( more than 20 times) no one replied to my call! And we call it customer service 24/7!! Our flight was delayed we did not even know but as we arrived at the airport they Said that we are going at 23h20 instead of 00h40! We said okay.. and it was 22h50! But in the end we came by mk 141 at 00h40! What's the use of telling us that we're going more earlier?? No one told us that flights have been delayed? I myself am in the tourism industry! Never came accross this type of service! My sister and I got the seat 15F and 15D.. As per the terms and conditions we should put our luggage in the box just above our head! But other guests filled the boxes 15A, 15C, 15D and 15F with their luggages! A steward ( Mr. Sanjay) came to ask if I could put my luggage in another box?? Like really?? We bought 8 bottles of Whiskey and he tells us to keep it far away from us while others took our place?? Well it's like we are travelling by bus!! Why should we reserve our seat then?? We can just go and sit wherever we want!! Why should we pay for excess luggage when we can not even have a place to put our handbags and purchased things in Duty Free in the luggage box? Is this a Mauritian Airline? If yes, then it is the worst airline!! Very disappointed!! The steward Sanjay came to apologise with a cake! But we could not even have a place to eat! Take a look at the attached pictures about how we were trying to eat with all our duty free bags (8 bottles of Whiskey and chocolates, Fragile things i would say) !! While others are eating at ease, us being tired, we had to help each other trying to get a place to eat! While others are sleeping peacefully we had to worry about our bags as there's a lot of turbulences on our way to Mauritius! We could not even rest!

For those flying from Singapore, they are constrained by 1 checkin luggage of 30 kgs. It is not practical to travel with such heavy and huge luggage. It seems that Mauritians buying air tickets from Mauritius to Singapore are not subject to this rule though and wonder about the double standard.

Air Mts has not improved its competitiveness and remained complacent over the years. For the amount the paid and 7 hrs flight, we could fly to Europe or US from Asia. Unfortunately, there’s only one airline from Singapore to Mts and that’s Air Mts. Otherwise, we will not fly Air Mts.

We have travelled from Madagascar to Seychelles via Mauritius and when we arrived in Seychelles at 1 am our luggage (2 pieces) did not arrive. I filled in the form of delayed luggage and then I tried to contact them on the phone. I was left waiting and waiting on their line. In the end I had to hang up because the international calls are not cheap in this part of the world. Then I have written to them 2 emails asking for reimbursement of the money paid on the clothes we had to buy because our both luggage have arrived after 2.5 days. No answer yet after one week from my last email. I am thinking seriously to start a legal case against them because I have not seen an airline that doesnn’t care about the passenger rights.

There were so many things wrong about this flight.  At no point did I feel like Air Mauritius wanted the air travelers to have a good experience on this 5hr red eye.  Pros: Direct flight from Cape Town to Mauritius.  That's it! Cons: Dark Time for Sleeping:  This flight was 5hrs and the time the lights were off was somewhere around 1.5hrs.  Main dinner served one hr. into the flight was so not needed.  Lights were then turned back on 55 minutes prior to landing.  Why so early?  Lack of Entertainment.  Seats are equipped with great flat screens but they are not turned on until 30 minutes into the flight and then turned off 30 before landing.  Most absurd thing I've ever encountered.  The free headsets are also collected 40 minutes prior to landing.  Have never seen this before either.  It felt like they were trying to make you suffer by doing nothing.  Flight Staff: Rude is the best way to explain it.  At no point did I see a smile from them or an outwardly friendly attempt to make your experience better.  Overhead Speaker usage:  This flight had by far the most unnecessary overhead announcements.  Super annoying when on a red eye and everyone is just trying to get a few hours sleep.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerShafe,TravelerShafe wrote a review Dec 2019,TravelerShafe,"London, United Kingdom",48 contributions,35 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r733537822-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Really Bad,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Travelling to Mauritius was great. The departure was on time. The plane was spacious with quite a bit of leg room. The cuisine was great and the service was excellent.

"First time taking Air Mauritius and I must say I am really pleasantly surprised by the level and quality of service rendered. The planes are of newer models so the inflight entertainment touchscreen works really well and fast, though the range of latest releases are quite limited. The seats and tables are quite clean and prior to taking off they use a disinfectant spray to disinfect the plane’s aisle. They also provided a blue air Mauritius sling pouch bag with toiletries and a pair of socks and eye mask in it, which was super useful and I ended up using the pouch throughout my trip.

However, the food selections and quality weren’t great (chicken or fish). For our onward journey we had curry chicken rice (which was the nicest option), but the fish was a tad dry and tasteless. On the return flight, also only fish and chicken option but this time it was chicken noodles, the fish was the same though! The good thing was that the bread buns are individually pouched, which meant we could take it out if we can’t finish it on the flight.

Service was ok, with a couple of drinks served and also a snack (pretzel) served for the morning.

Interesting tip: each of their airlines have a unique name to it and the pilot would share that on the flight or you can spot it before boarding. Mine was aapravasi ghat, which is a UNESCO heritage site for indentured labourers (interesting place that I would recommend you to visit).

Overall the experience was great and I would take this airline again!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/b1/d4/49/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandacsm,Amanda C wrote a review Dec 2019,Amanda C,"Singapore, Singapore",500 contributions,61 helpful votes,Singapore - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r731633419-Air_Mauritius-World.html,New and clean planes,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Cape Town residents are offered only two flights a week on the direct Air Mauritius service but can also choose to go via ORT where the schedule is more regular, but which still involves a 06.00 connector to ORT to catch the most convenient SAA190 service to the island. Having done this earlier in the year, I decided to brave the direct flight very recently. I use the description ""brave"" with intent as the flight leaves shortly after 22.00 and arrives in Plaisance around 05.00. That means sleeping rythms are shattered, especially given the two hour time diff on arrival. With dinner only being wrapped up at around 01.30 Mauritian time, the chances of any shut-eye are slim. Worse still, the arrival time on the island means that hotel check-in is likely to be a delayed affair but it does also mean that queues at immigration are more likley to be non-existent as was the case. So, for CPT residents, the convenience of avoiding ORT is off-set to a degree and I suspect this direct route is marginally more expensive too. On balance, I'd stick with direct more particularly because the return MK844 flight offers more amenable hours and a considerable time saving on the ORT diversion.As for the speciifics of the flight, the aircraft was a very new Airbus A330-900neo which flies beautifully and is remarkably quiet, even when seated behind the wing. Overhead bin space is especially good but Air Mauritius rather spoils everything by cramming in too many seats. Pitch is mean - I'm guessing at 31 - and the seats themselves, although swathed in attractive pale blue and grey fabric, are the new ""thin shell"" type and are a bit shapeless as a result. If the passenger in front uses full recline, you need to resemble a circus trapeze artist to get out! The infotainment system is very good, supplemented by a choice of external cameras and a full-house package of info on the progress of the flight.  Crew attitude was friendly and efficient and the dinner/beverages option was rather good by normal Y class standards. On descent, only water or fruit juice is offered so stock up while  you have the dinner option in front of you.  All arrival paperwork was handed out early in the flight which was appreciated. Altogether, a decent effort by Air Mauritius but that outbound schedule is a bit draining such that day one on the island was accompanied by lots of yawns.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wiley962,wiley962 wrote a review Dec 2019,wiley962,"Cape Town, South Africa",12 contributions,6 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r731600523-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Direct in the dead of night!,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Having booked due to them having upgraded the aircraft on the London Mauritius route, imagine the frustration when Ibget to Heathrow to find they have VERY quietly replaced the brand new aircraft with 25 year old clapped out tin cans with wings..The reason being from reliable sources is that despite knowing this the new A330-900 and the A350-XWB cannot carry all of the cargo with a full load of passengers and the required fuel to make the trip.... Somebody needs to fired for that blazing error.... The Cabin crew appear to have been told it is rude to smile or appear cheerful in anyway.  I felt like I was attending an in flight funeral they were that miserable.  I gave up trying to make conversation it was like talking to a rock.. The food - If that's what you can call it looked like actual road kill.  It was small chunks of an insipid grey coloured meat.  Supposed to be chicken - it actually looked like a brain...  It was also cold.  I mentioned this and Ibwas looked at like I was an idiot.  Food poisoning written all over that.  If I could have thrown it out the window I would have.  Worst food offering of any airline I have ever been on.  I travel alot.. In flight entertainment - A limited selection of old movies.  Nothing new at all.Comfort.  Not really.  Having paid more to fly with Air Mauritius than Emirates I hoped it might be better but emirates are decades ahead in everything..Customer service.  Not interested.  The end.. I commented on facebook and it was deleted.  So other people didn't see it. Will never use them again.. Definately avoid.

We flew to Mauritius for at the beginning of the month of November; it was a very good experience and I recommend this airline for its very clean and comfortable aircraft.

"Air Mauritius always give good service on the plane journey, so no faults there at all. My problem was the seat that we chose. I booked online and said that my husband and I would like to be seated together. We were given E3 and E4, which were in fact together, the only two in the business class section that are configured like that. However, our flight left Mauritius at 10.15pm, so we were flying through the night. The other passengers were able to stretch out their seats and get into a lying down position, but our seats were positioned such that this was not possible, so we had a rather uncomfortable night trying to sleep. Now this is not an earth shattering problem, I have put this review in to advise others to be aware of this.

"The best African Airline that we have travelled in. We booked through a travel website and wanted to add few details later on. Called the local airline office in Mumbai. Staff was extremely polite and helpful. Inflight experience was also smooth and pleasant. Flight was on time. One of the rare airlines to provide goodie bags to customers. The only room for improvement was vegetarian meal taste and menu which can always be improvised. The crew was hospitable, though, could have bettered the experience with a smile on their face. Looked tired due to odd flight times both ways but never looked annoyed with all kinds of travellers on board. Will surely prefer this airline if they connect to a future destination.

"Flights to Rodrigues from Mauritius are only provided by Air Mauritius so this is Hobson’s Choice - there are no other options so no competition.For non-Mauritians it costs about £100 each way.  The flight distance is about 300km so this seems to me to be one of the most expensive economy flights in the world!The flights are on twin propellor planes that take about 60 passengers.  The seats are compact (being polite!) and space reduces as the fuselage tapers towards the rear.  Seats at the front are a bit of a nuisance as the overhead lockers are filled with equipment needed by the crew so bags have to be stowed a few rows behind you - if there is space.  Luggage allowance is a tiny 15kg unless you have a Kestrel Flyer reward, or being on an international transit entitled to the luggage allowance of the longer flight.  But, be warned, if there is no room then bags might be deferred to the next flight.  My relatives used the flight this weekend (16 November) - one had a suitcase delayed on the way out and the other has a lost suitcase on the way back (I’m sure It will turn up - after all nothing like a case full of dirty laundry to find it’s Way home!).Departure us from the domestic terminal at La Plaisance.  There is nothing to cause confusion as this is the ONLY domestic flight in Mauritius so you cannot get lost.Boarding and disboarding means catching a small overheated bus which has very few seats.  People with children or disabilities need to arrive early and nudge for seats, otherwise it is standing room only for the short journey.  Arriving at the plane is often chaotic as there seems to be no procedure.  Everyone just mills around the steps pushing forward for position.  But getting in the plane early has no advantage in this chaos as there is always someone blocking the aisle as they juggle some oversized luggage into the tiny lockers.  I often wonder why Air Mauritius staff could not be a little more organized - board elderly, disabled and children first, then all other passengers could board in sequence by row numbers.The flight is often away in time, for the 90 minutes in the air, the flight crew give basic departure, flight, and arrival information.  When airborne there is a hot coffee, fruit juice, and snack box, served at your seat.  Given most no-frills airlines have removed such refreshments to cut costs it is really good that AM continues with in-flight refreshments.  Menu options can be selected on the website, when working, and this is essential for dietary choices as no spares are carried on the flight.The excitement of arriving in Rodrigues, or Mauritius, in daylight and seeing the glorious Baie Topaze as the plane descends to the tiny airport is a joy.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikingLondon,VikingLondon wrote a review Nov 2019,VikingLondon,London,15 contributions,10 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Rodrigues Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r727021625-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Hobson’s Choice,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Being with an infant it was extremely important to me to be understood by the staff. However not only did they fail at performing basic services like giving water timely as asked, a Caucasian looking air hostess went a step ahead and shouted at me for not keeping the bag up. I asked her for her help with it which only infuriated her even more and she said “I’m very busy “, clearly she was incompetent and a rude person. She was blind to the fact that I was holding an infant and had forgotten her training.

In flight entertainment didn’t work on both flights/ legs. We got horrible experience on exiting the flight as well as our baby stroller came after a 1.5 hour long wait after we had received all other luggage! They had no helpful support staff at the MUMBAI airport. Seriously it’s a non-serious airline.

"The trip from Mauritius to Cape town was completely different from the return trip. When going to cape town, the plane was a very old plane, not comfortable, limited legrooms and the in flight entertainment nearly non existent with a screen where you can barely see anything. Service was very poor and many calls were unattended. It was probably due to the fact that there was lots of kids on the plane...but still not acceptable.

The return flight was however another story. the plane was quite new, seats were more comfortable with more space for legs. Entertainment was much better and even service was excellent. the hostesses seemed much polite and request were attended within minutes.

This was my first time I was visiting Mauritius and that to by a Mauritius  to Mauritius. It was a non stop flight which was an encouraging. I boarded the flight at Mumbai international airport. At the entrance of the plane the flight attendants greeted us with an unmatched smile. I felt a little elated as the air hostess was stout and amazingly charming. I asked her and she was proud to inform me that she was a Mauritian. My doubts about the Mauritian girls were rested. As they were stout and tall and above all most charming. I took my seat. Of course I had booked a window seat which I willing asked my partner to occupy it as it was his first international tour. He was certainly most pleased. The flight took off on proper time. Definitely it was a pleasant take off. After an hour they served us the breakfast as it was a morning flight. The breakfast was definitely sumptuous and equally filling. I definitely enjoyed it. Later they served us tea coffee. It was really refreshing. The flight was of 6.00 hrs. duration. I know it's quiet tiring. But it is amazingly pleasant if the cabin crew members are humble and most helpful. I would certainly say that the long journey became    bearable and most enjoyable because of the most competent cabin crew. It was certainly most endearing and equally pleasing experience.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/76/15/9e/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710anilk,ANIL KANDALGAONKAR wrote a review Oct 2019,ANIL KANDALGAONKAR,"Mumbai, India",37 contributions,10 helpful votes,Mumbai - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r718535735-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Most endearing experience. ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On our flight to Mauritius on the Sunday night we were met with the most amazing and friendly flight staff.
Unfortunately we sat in the rear in the middle three seats rows and it was least to say very, very uncomfortable.
My wife has had 3 back operations in a short time quite recently and even though I tried to check in online and change seats, it was impossible.
Nevertheless, the food was good and the service friendly and excellent.

On our return we managed to change our seat through our hotel (at a cost) and changed it to the two seats nearest the window and wow! what a difference!

"Was flying back to Mauritius after a long stop-over in JHB and changed my flight to the MK carrier (ticket issued by SAA) and glad to have done so !
The ""good feeling"" factor started at the checkin itself where the welcome and service was indeed ""premium"" - efficient and quick + the lady offered to change my seat to a ""better"" one, i.e., having window + corridor access. I was informed that it was an Airbus 350 (the latest acquisition by Air Mauritius) and the window seats were single seats and only the central one were double.

Service on board was excellent, warm welcome, champagne, drinks as and when needed and food was good too and I had the opportunity to re-taste ostrich meat since a long time. The wine was excellent too - good variety and with the entertainment on board on the quite wide personal screen (a bit limited in terms of movie options though), I hardly noticed the 4h flight.

"Booked through an agent who reserved our seats 3E&F for trips both way. This review is about the outward journey 5pm flight on the 8th September our wedding anniversary. Check in was quick. Into the lounge within 25 minutes. However the priority security queue was slower than normal security. Once in the lounge the choice of foods was acceptable. Nothing exciting but more than adequate for a 11+ hour flight. We managed to get some friends into the lounge to celebrate with us. The champagne was not free flowing had to ask a couple of times for a new bottle. Heineken on tap though.... once called to board the process was a bit chaotic. Seemed that business class was not a benefit. Ho-hum we got on the plane a fairly new A330. However at 175cm and 88kg I have to say the seats were very small to sit in. They tapered in at the footwell. Staff were very helpful and the food offerings were excellent. Hot and delicious with more than enough choice. Drinks kept coming for the first 2 hours. Then they dried up. Had to ask for them. In flight entertainment not that up to date. Hardly any “new releases” mainly 6 months and older. The rest of the entertainment system not that great. Also plenty of dubbing for naughty words in the films. the screen sizes were incredible though. See pictures. Another issue is the noise from the engines. Considering your are 30 feet from the cockpit the engine noise is extremely loud. Earplugs were required to sleep. Now to the flat bed. Okay I’m no skinny athlete but I’m hardly obese either. I could not sleep on my back with my arms by my side. Had to hold them above my head. The beds were not that comfortable and the temperature in the plane fluctuated. I managed about 4 hours disturbed sleep in all. Flight was on time and arrived safely. Exiting the aircraft was a free for all. Then as “premium” customers we were asked to go through security in the privilege line. Well the normal lines were empty so that took forever. Our bags came out fairly quickly but some friends that were in economy took over 55 minutes to arrive. All in all an average experience.

"We flew from Antananarivo (TNR) to Mauritius (MRU) on September 13 in Business Class. The ticket was purchased on the Air Mauritius website for around USD 460 per person for the 1 way trip. Even though the flight time was less than 2 hours, we wanted to try Business Class and the ticket was only about $100 more than flying Economy.

At TNR airport, Air Mauritius check in opens 3 hours before the flight. Since we were in Business Class, we were able to use the Air France Lounge which is next to Gate 1A. There were food and drinks.

The flight time was 4:50 pm and when we walked to the gate at 4 pm, every one was pretty much boarded. We walked on the tarmac onto the plane. No photos were allowed of the outside of the plane.

Juice and water is served pre flight. No alcoholic drinks were served.

We actually departed at 4:30 pm, 20 minutes before our scheduled departure time.

The food was OK. It was like a cold plate where the food still tasted very cold. Service was also just OK.

Our flight was only 1 hour and 20 minutes and we landed 25 minutes early.

The seats were very comfortable and Business Class was very empty.

"The review of the airline includes the experience of the airline at OR International airport in Johannesburg, South Africa. The service at the airport was average; it was South African Airways (SAA) staff on duty. This could be because of a joint-venture / code-sharing agreement between the two airlines. There was a bit of delay in helping passengers in the queue. A lady staff in Business Class counter was not busy but did not assist even though there was no Business Class passengers to assist. SUGGESTION: Assist passengers and ""get them away"" as quickly as possible. Another lady staff that assisted us was not friendly in the beginning but eventually warmed up because of engagement with my kids. At the boarding gate, the service was poor. Business Class queue was not busy and a staff member was not pro-actively calling out families with children to be assisted. SUGGESTION: call out families with children into an empty counter to reduce length in queues and still give preference to Business Class passengers if they arrive after the families that are in the Business Class queue. Once in the aircraft, it was clear that it was an old aircraft. The quality in the cabin was evident - from seat design to infotainment to storage compartment, etc. When the flight took off, it took a while for the infotainment to be active and in operational mode; that was frustrating. The experience on the infotainment was not great and the flight information was showing a return trip, which was odd. The air-hostess would also provide headphones much later after take-off and collect it over 30min before landing; it was a short time to use the infotainment system. It took also quite a while for food to be served; this could be so that they do not have to serve something close to arrival time. There was no food menu print-out to read and as such had to decide on the spot when the air-hostess asked you. Leg room is limited for tall passengers with my knees touching the handle of the front seats. One good thing provided was a small bag of goodies for children in the flight; that is thoughtful of the airline.
The experience of the airline on our return flight was a better experience. However, with South Africans being frequent visitors to Mauritius, it is quite inconvenient to fly into and out of Mauritius in terms of timing. You arrive in Mauritius and exit the airport around 8:30pm and passengers have to be at the airport for return flights to South Africa around 6:30am. There is two days lost in the holiday travel for South African passengers.
The advantage of Air Mauritius is they offer good packages at differnet times of the year; e.g. flight costs can be free for children and only airport taxes have to paid for if a hotel package is bought as well.

They got wise when the flight departed at 0230 in the morning. Not disturbing people  unduly to serve food. Just a small snack for those interested only. So it was good to sleep. However  we were woken up some 5 he's later for breakfast. But immediately they decided to switch off the lights and let us sleep more. Excellent idea. Food as usual was OK. Plenty. The only down side is the leg room. If there was a couple of inches more at knee level. Check in especially if u are a kestrel frequent flyer is smooth.

"We decided on a non stop flight to begin with to get the journey over and done with which turned out to be the wrong decision. The only upgrade was Business Class which was the same cost again for each of us. You could offer a price for BC on their internet site but it was set at a high price. The seats going were row 14 and were very uncomfortable I am average size 74kg and 175cm tall, we changed the seats on the flight back to row 44 which were slightly better. Once you book your meal which was vegetarian going and very bland, only warm I decided to try and change this on our return flight but again their site would not allow this. The staff were very friendly but did not always remember your requests. The flight entertainment was very poor with films that were not new and out of date. So for paying premium prices £830 each we felt cheated compared to other airlines we have travelled with eg Emirates to India were more comfortable - easier to upgrade with fair prices - better entertainment - and more cost effective.
We discussed this with other travellers in Mauritius as well as locals who all said that its best to fly to Mauritius with a stop. They suggested Emirates, Turkish or Lufthansa which will be done if we return to Mauritius again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/00/6a/b3/gog69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GOG69,GOG69 wrote a review Sep 2019,GOG69,"Bedford, United Kingdom",208 contributions,83 helpful votes,Mahebourg - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r709284111-Air_Mauritius-World.html,For the price not a good experience,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The aeroplane from London to Mauritius was 8 days old.  Good seat pitch and entertainment choice.  Had a night flight and dinner was pleasant.  After dinner there was a 7 hour gap where no food or drink was served or offered.  No sign of cabin staff.  Breakfast was served so late we didn't get offered a hot drink ( bearing in mind we had no drink service all night) and we nearly landed with our trays on laps.

It was really exceptional and the inflight entertainment is something that SAA does not have although it is a 4 hour flight BUT you really have to keep your passengers entertained and Air Mauritius has achieved this!

"We had high hopes after being told by our agent that Air Mauritius had improved lots and had new aircraft this summer. It wasn't great to be perfectly honest. The seats in economy weren't very comfortable but thats the norm in most airlines. The food was dreadful both dinner and breakfast were inedible. The staff whilst fairly friendly and polite seemed to have a very odd system for delivering the meals. Our rows were still waiting for anything after everyone else had finished and been cleared away, not great after about 4 hours sitting on a plane without even being offfered a drink. They didn't come round much with drinks generally, not even teas and coffees after dinner and we all had to keep getting up to go to the back to get cups of water.

"When one boards a flight, one looks for convenience, entertainment, hospitality and proper service. Air mauritius' flight which i took from delhi to mauritius along with three others on 28 july, 2019 MK 745 with departure scheduled at 8 am was lacking in all the above. I was extremely thirsty. I used the call bell but nobody came. I personally requested the attendant who was passing by. He said that he will do the needful in a jiffy but that jiffy took about 20 minutes. Except for one or two, the rest of the staff was rude and straight-faced. When my friend requested for a second can of beer, the hostess after having much arrogance on her face said that they will provide for the same after they have served all the passengers. No problem! But then when asked for it again, she said that their policy does not allow them for the same. Though later she brought the glass of beer. Is this the way the hospitality industry works?

"This was an AF flight that was filled by MK. Unfortunately, this was the only flight that I could find that would fit my schedule. Here are my gripes:
MK behaves like it is not affiliated to AF. I am a Platinum medallion member which is honored by AF. However, MK does not offer the same treatment on this AF flight. The check in was handled by MK and there were no Sky priority lines, no indication that this was an AF partner flight, and no support for frequent flyers apart from the Kestrel program.

The online check-in was even more confusing... the checkin form appears to have been populated with inaccurate information and my initial check in failed. Apparently the usual US month / day represention does not translate well to the Euro / MRU day / month format. After making the change, I also had problems with the loyalty information - did not allow my skymiles id to be entered. Finally, the boarding pass did not have any information that would indicate that I have priority boarding and access to airport lounges.

All those problems are simple usability problems that can be easily fixed but I am not holding my breath.

I do not usually bring my Skymiles Platinum loyalty card as all those info are on my mobile app. I was fortunate that I brought that card for this trip as MK could not help at all here. I had to flash that card and explain my priority status to every airline staff because this info was nowhere to be found on the original checkin boarding pass issued by MK.

I also have the same complaint for baggage. I had to ask to have the priority tag set on my lugguage.

Finally, the checkin schedule - had to show up 3 hrs before flight because there is no priority processing. As a frequent flyer, airports are not holiday spots and I would rather have spent an additional hour or two in vacation mode elsewhere.

However, in order to ensure that i get to my final destination - of which MK was only 1 of the legs, I had to bite the bullet and spend the time and effort to get all the paperwork documented. Additional stress that i did not plan.

What a mess!

Used to be a great airline with friendly and courteous staff. Has gone down significantly.

"Loved flying in the new Air Mauritius A330-900 Neo. It was very comfortable, with lots of leg room and wide, comfortable seats.

The leg room was not compromised with the seat in front of me fully reclined either (I am 6' foot tall, and the person in the seat in front of me was 6'7""!).

The entertainment on offer was of a good standard, with a large touch screen with multiple options (movies, TV shows, music, radio, games, map, etc.). One great feature was in the upgraded flight map where there were a couple of camera views - one of what was in front of the plane, and one of below, which was brilliant to see what you were flying over.

The onboard food and drinks were lovely, with real metal cutlery.

With a stowed /checked-in baggage allowance of more than 30kg there was not much need to have a large carry on.

All in all a very pleasant flight, through which I slept for a large portion (something that rarely happens on flights).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/60/ef/7b/david-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8457NOdavidw,David W wrote a review Aug 2019,David W,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",13 contributions,19 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r700540621-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Very comfortable,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight is around 9hrs duration but this was made very easy by the lovely staff and facilities on board the plane. The food served was traditional Mauritian curries with a choice of two. The portions were just right with a serving of dessert also. There were many options for both non alcoholic and alcoholic, which was served several times during the meal. The selections for inflight entertainment were broad with current movies and classic television. There were also options for games if you wished or had younger travellers with you. A small pack that contained things like an eye mask and a pair of socks along with a blanket and small pillow helped to make the possibility of sleep achievable.

"We flew Air Mauritius in Business Class from DEL-MRU and back. While flying from DEL to MRU (MK745), the crew was fabulous and we enjoyed the customer service. The seats were comfortable and food was ok.

However, the nightmare started on our way back from Mauritius. Our 2 year old's nanny was also flying with us, but in the economy class as it was a last minute booking for her and the business class was already full. Since the baby is very attached to his nanny, almost inseparable from her (as my wife and I are both working), we needed her for a short time in business class only to feed the baby and put him to sleep (so that its peaceful and quiet for others too). However, the crew was absolutely unhelpful this time, with Karuna Dhahal leading the crew! They literally fought with us to prevent the nanny from taking care of the baby at his seat in business class, giving all sorts of illogical excuses. Yes, we had paid for a separate seat for the baby, so its not that she was getting in anyone's way! We understand that airlines have Standard Operating Procedures and we appreciate that, but all that we wanted was for the nanny to feed the baby, put him to sleep and then of course, go back to her actual seat, just the way she did on our journey from DEL - MRU. It took us several minutes of heated arguments with the woman in charge to finally concede to our request when the baby got very cranky without the nanny as it was past his bedtime! Eventually, the nanny didn't even spend 10% of the flight time in the business class as the baby was asleep the rest of the overnight journey.

What was more shocking than anything else was that when we told Karuna Dhahal that her colleagues on the DEL-MRU sector went out of the way to accommodate the nanny in the business class for a few minutes, she responded unabashedly saying that her colleagues didn't do their job properly!!!!!

The nightmare for us didn't end there. My wife is a vegetarian and when asked for dinner options, she clearly stated her choice. However, they served her with chicken salad for appetisers and then, instead of apologising, they again argued with us! It seems like the staff hasn't been trained around sensitivities regarding vegetarian vs non-vegetarian diet in India, even when so many people from India travel to Mauritius daily and majority of Hindus don't eat chicken.

Please note that we didn't experience any of these issues in the DEL-MRU flight where the crew was extremely nice and understanding. We know one thing for sure, we loved Mauritius and if we were to ever travel to the country again, we would hope and pray while booking our tickets that we don't get Karuna Dhahal on any of the flights!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/ff/38/87/rahul-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rahul3282,Rahul3282 wrote a review Jul 2019,Rahul3282,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",12 contributions,1 helpful vote,Mahebourg - New Delhi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r688991687-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Customer service in business class was a nightmare,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It was a pleasant way to break a long journey and arrive and leave at reasonable times to fly Perth/Mauritius and overnight there as part of the fare to Cape Town.

If you have the time to break the journey I would recommend this.  On the way back I upgraded to Business Class and stayed with a friend for a week in beautiful Mauritius.  I'm not sure the shorter trips warranted the extra expense but I loved the spoil of it and extra luggage allowance.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLRegel,KLRegel wrote a review Jul 2019,KLRegel,"Perth, Australia",17 contributions,1 helpful vote,Perth - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r688308921-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Mauritian stay over for Aussie travellers,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"12 hour flight and only 3 drinks. One of those drinks was a half cup of water which we had to force out of them. Staff no where to be seen most of flight. Food terrible. Breakfast an hour late and cold,air hostess (miserable and didn't want to be there) stood over me trying to rush me to finish it. Pushed button for service several times and completely ignored.
To sum up, I wouldn't use this airline again until the service and staff are seriously improved. Even though it was a direct flight I would rather use another airline like Thai or Singapore Airlines with a stop in between. Take your own water on board to ensure you get a drink, even though you shouldn't have to. Diabolical service. No wonder they didn't ask me to review the return trip after the scathing review I put on their requested email for review on the flight to Mauritius.

"I have travelled on business class on this airline multiple times for work on the Mumbai Mauritius sector. Service has been decent and transactional always. No warmth or hospitality. Typical government owned airline. This time on the 25 th of June I was on seat 3 A. During meal service i told the stewardess that though the company would have booked a veg meal,i eat everything. She smiled and got me the non veg starter which was a chicken tikka. Problem is that it was absolutely chilled. I bought it to her notice and she said sorry and took it away. Then she got me a veg meal. I said if you got me a chicken starter, why the veg meal. I asked to see the supervisor. Now this is the best. This man says that since I told the stewardess that i can eat anything they got me a non veg starter and veg meal.  I asked when i sent the chilled tikka back, why was there no replacements?

"3 days prior to our departure to Mauritius, my father passed away. We were forced to change our travel by 3 days to allow for the funeral. Air Mauritius, however would not wave the ticket change fee without a certified copy of the death certificate, my birth certificate and my marriage certificate to prove I was married to my wife who I was travelling with – all within 3 days of my father passing away. We received no compassion from the staff on the contact centre , in Mauritius and were told if we paid for the ticket change fees we could not challenge them. In Australia, it takes over a week to obtain the death certificate – in this case it took 10 days and we were already in Mauritius. Once in Mauritius, we even went to the head office in Port Louis but again despite promises of review, no change ticket change fee refund was granted and no reason given for the denial of our request.
ON return to Australia, we tried again locally and although we received one call and one email, nobody has contacted us since.

"The flight was initially delayed by 17 hours through no fault of the airline. However, we are still awaiting compensation 10 weeks after submitting the claim despite this being a statutory compensation claim under EU laws. We are experiencing appalling customer service and anyone would think they don’t need custom! I must say we have been extremely patient as we recognise that it was a fluke that created the delay (a bird flew into the engine). Our patience is now running very thin as they haven’t even got the decency to reply to an email.

The plane was far from clean. It was uncomfortable and the entertainment consisted of a very small screen and you did not have the option to pause or even listen to the films in English! To give some idea of how old the plane was - it still had ashtrays between the seats!

To top it off, in the middle of the first week of the holiday we were advised that the plane home had been cancelled and so we had the option of travelling home a day later or doing a detour via Paris. I note from other reviews that this is a bit of a pattern.

Our holiday was booked through Virgin Holidays and I must say we were very surprised that they are happy to be associated with an organisation that offers such poor service.

"My first experience with Air Mauritius has definitely gained them a client.

Previous experience with other airlines have left me disappointed in terms of baggage handling. Some of my toiletries were cracked and leaking and my eye shadow and blusher left in almost powder form or tiny pieces.

My check in process and baggage claim went without a glitch on both inbound and outbound flights.

Expecting the worst of the condition of my toiletries - I was pleasantly surprised to find everything intact.

The cabin crew were friendly and helpful.
Meals were lovely and warm.

A special thanks to first officer Iqbal for a super landing in Mauritius.

Air Mauritius contributed to a lovely and glitch-free holiday.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/e6/aa/18/erica-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericas179,Erica S wrote a review Jun 2019,Erica S,"Durban, South Africa",93 contributions,15 helpful votes,Durban - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r683206410-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Plane Mon Choisy ,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On 10 th of April 2019, we were given baggage tag of Air Canada instead of Air France .( From Mauritius to CDG with Air Mauritius and connecting flight Air France to Toronto).
Upon arrival in Totonto, that's when we found out our luggages were expedited by Air Canada instead of our AF flight.We were without our luggages for 5 consecutive days . On April 11 when we landed in TO, it was chilly . My wife and I had to brace that cold weather with no warm clothes .
I reported the case to Air Mauritius with proof of the mess ( scan copies of our lugagge tags ). Been in touch with Air Mru every 3 weeks ....up to now , very disappointed with Air Mru because I got no response from them.
Why they don't respond? Why they don't acknowledge their mistake? Why can't they compensate me for the nightmare we've been through?

"My sister IS  flying to Mauritius with Air Mauritius from Melbourne stopping in Perth. Due to our Grandfathers illness and I'm being taken off life support my sis came to Perth early to say goodbye, b4 her trip to Mauritius. She rang Air Mauritius to see if she could board plane in Perth to save her flying back to Melbourne to fly back to Perth again. No it wasn't allowed. Seriously, what's the issue. The flight is paid for, they can just resell the Melbourne Perth seat making twice as much money. She's not asking for a refund just asking to board in Perth instead of melbourne. But no, stupidity and a serious lack of common sense says no. She must get on the plane in Melbourne. Leaving less time with my grandpa. Honestly it's just stupid and they were rude and unhelpful. She explained the situation and they told her to get a letter from the hospital, which she did, but they still wouldn't change ticket. So before you book air Mauritius think strongly. We will never travel with them again and will make sure this story is heard everywhere.

We flew to Johannesburg May 30th and returned June 4th in business class both ways by upgrading for a fee at the airport. Wifi was offered both ways which I needed for work but was not working both ways. Flight attendants knew this yet counter agents did not tell us. I complained and their response was for me to write a letter. I was charged a premium for service I did not receive.

"We upgraded our return flight to Durban from economy to business. Everyone we spoke to has told us not to waste our money but we found the trip very pleasant. Whilst the seat cannot be compared to competitors carriers who fly longer distances, the business class on Air Mauritius still gave us ample leg room. The seat are admittedly identical to those in economy, but the middle seat is blocked thus rendering this business class a 2-seat set up on both sides of the isle. The folded-down middle seat has a hard cover back kind which makes it very useful for storage. I thought the pitch of the seat does allow the passenger to recline slightly more as in economy, but cannot be sure.

"We travel with Air Mauritius on a fairly regular basis as we love taking holidays in Mauritius and they are the best option from Perth.

The plane was much newer this time with improved leg room. Food was OK on the outbound flight, but service was very inattentive and inefficient. We did not eat the meal on the way back as it was an overnight flight. They have reduced the breakfast service to dry cake and a hot beverage. It would be infinitely better for passengers if they served a supper snack and a cooked breakfast. It would also be appreciated if they introduce “Do Not Wake” stickers for passengers to place on their seats as the stewardess insisted on waking me to ask if I wanted dinner at midnight! As it is they turn all the lights on a good two hours before you land in Perth so you only get about four hours sleep which is why we have given up booking business class for the return flight. Just not worth it!

All our luggage travelled with us successfully this time so that was a welcome difference from our last trip.

"This complaint is based on the service received from Air Mauritius South Africa - departing and arrival - service from Mauritius side is excellent.
1. We travel with a cerebral palsy person and a disabled person and request in advance the bulkhead seating which we are informed cannot be booked in advance. Reason for this advance booking is the cerebral palsy person needs 100% assistance and needs to be carried to the seat as the airline wheelchair does not work as he cannot hold himself up and trying to carry him to the back of the plane doesnt work either. Plus his legs do not bend at a 90 degree angle nor do they straighten properly nor can he hold himself up so surely the airline should be compassionate and have better ways of dealing with these situations
2. The Manager in 2018 screamed at us to hurry up and get on the plane even though i understood that disabled are meant to be boarded first but was not done and hence the manager screaming at us, across the passage, over other passengers.
3. 2019 trip and the same manager on duty who informs us we have upset his passengers by asking for the bulkhead seats and have caused hassles.
I am appalled that he can treat people like this, especially people who need a bit of extra help. Being told that disabled must sit at the back of the plane is not the correct way in dealing with this and having told him to maybe have a bit of compassion was a complete waste of time. We plan on flying in 2020 again and i dread what sort of service we will receive from this manager again.
I do not understand why the bulkhead seats couldnt be booked in advance - there were other travellers, who were able bodied - and they had booked these seats (i will note in 2018 and 2019).
What must we do to avoid this disgusting service again come 2020 as i dread what will happen the third time round.
4.Arriving back in SA our personal wheelchair and electric scooter was left outside in the rain and was delivered to us sopping wet - no consideration for the person using the chair or the fact that the scooter is electric and very expensive and was getting wet.
Why with so many calls and emails to Air Mauritius did they not offer other options - only response was you cannot book the seats until the day of the flight and even then we receive terrible service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleGentz,MicheleG wrote a review May 2019,MicheleG,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r672075555-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Terrible Service from SA Air Mauritius,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Two main issues here, firstly the quality of the business class service and secondly the delays.
The planes are really, really old. The lay flat beds in business class were more ""lay at a jaunty angle"" beds which made sleeping very difficult as you slip down the chair. The food was pretty poor. However the staff were reasonably helpful and friendly.
On the way back there was a fault with the plane, not surprising considering their age. We took off late, the fault developed, we ditched fuel in the ocean and then turned back. The only efficient thing about the whole process was the speed with which they took us to a local hotel, I assume they are well practised with faults and cancellations.
We had to wait until the next evening for another flight - they don't appear to have any spare planes or contingency plans.

"This was one of the worst flights we've ever been on.  As it was a long 11.5 hour flight there and 12.5 hours flight back, you would expect a certain level of comfort and good in-flight entertainment.  We had neither!  The plane was clearly very old, the seats were old and worn looking and even had the old ash trays!  The seats were not very comfortable.  The in-flight entertainment was absolutely rubbish.  Although we had individual TV screens the system was clearly extremely basic in that you did not have individual control over choosing what you wanted to watch and being able to pause it, etc.  The films were on a loop so you had to watch it when it started.  There were a few channels for films but they weren't very good and we didn't really like any of the choice.

We were shepherded to the overweight luggage section to receive further instructions. Masses of confused people swarmed around the desk and no preference for Business class passengers.  After queuing for around an hour we were told to queue for boarding a shuttle bus for transfer to the local Hilton Hotel for the day.  Too few shuttle buses and further delays.  Breakfast and lunch with non-alcoholic drinks were provided free.  The check-in for the late flight went OK but instead of the almost new A350-900 aircraft, we were promised they provided an aged A330-200 with a different seat configuration.  This meant that our previously booked window seats became centre seats.  The flight attendants were efficient but there was no apology from the Captain or First Officer for the delay.

Boarding too close to departure time. Done hastily. Seats and legroom a pity. Food is pathetic! (eat before boarding or carry your own food).

Crew members with friends and/or family onboard chit chat a lot and this is disturbing when you’re trying to sleep or cope with all the discomfort. Lack professionalism overall.

They have cancelled our return flight and offered a flight the day before, meaning we are paying for a hotel room without being able to use it. This is after they had moved it before, then reverted back to the original slot some days later. No explanation given other than staff describing their own airline as being in a mess.

They have moved our seats to the back of the plane because they are “randomly selected”.

Members of staff on the phone are unhelpful and badly uninformed - not understanding why seats or flights have been changed.

"Left on time and only just made the flight owing to the late connecting flight from Cape Town, which worried me in the sense that our cases might not transfer across the airport in time.
Food was average, in flight entertainment was poor and a throwback from the 90's as the aircraft was an old A340 even though there had been a refurb on the interior. Flight was comfortable mostly due to the flight being half empty.

"Worst flight experiance I had in my life time. I was visiting mauritius for my honeymoon. And the flight staff is so sensless, that everytime the flight would have very minor turbulance, air hostess would walk around checking the seat belt of every passenger, though they are in deep sleep.

I was wearing the belt throughout the flight, and I was sleeping, and the air hostess would come by me and my wife and she would literally wake me up just to show her if I have had my bealts on. This was so rude to me, though she was knowing that I am wearing the belt.

Also there is no option from India to mauritius so we have to choose this flight for no option.

"On the 31st of March 2019, my family and I had the misfortune of being booked to fly (or not fly as the case actually was) on MK843 back to Cape Town.

We arrived (my wife and I and our two children aged 7 and 9) after being transported from Club Med La Pointe Canonniers at the airport around 1pm on Sunday afternoon to be informed that the expected departure of 16:15 was delayed to 18:25. That time arrived but there was still no sight of the plane or any information being relayed by the departure gate staff in terms of what could be expected in terms of departure time. At that stage, there was no indication of when we would fly and very little information from the departure gate staff (in terms of what was causing it, bar from a vague excuse that the technical team are attending to it) only to be told that the next update will be provided at 19:30. Roll on 19:30 and yet so information.

In the interim, meal vouchers were provided for the Tropical Break takeaway kiosk for a choice of either cold fried rice or fried noodles as the only options which was completely cold and inedible with the takeaway kiosk being unable to cope with the mass of people with only one microwave on site to heat the food on offer.

Just after 8pm that evening, after spending seven hours at the airport we were told that flight MK843 was cancelled and that the flight would be rescheduled and that hotel accommodation would be provided to travellers. In the normal course of events, that would have been fine but the incompetence and complete lack of customer care that followed completely destroyed the relaxation that was achieved whilst holidaying in Mauritius for the past 11 days which will likely result in my family and I never ever flying Air Mauritius ever again or perhaps ever considering Mauritius as a holiday destination again.

After going through customs we were directed to a single kiosk where only two ground staff assisted to help 200 irate passengers find suitable accommodation for the evening. We were assigned to the Peninsula Hotel which we were happy about as it was only 16 mins away from the airport, but that joy shortly dissipated when we arrived at the hotel to be told by reception that we were in fact not assigned to that specific hotel as another airline’s cancelled flight was already booked in an hour prior to ours (this was apparently a mistake that was made by Air Mauritius ground staff). We continued to spend another 90 mins at that hotel waiting to hear from Air Mauritius in terms of what the next option was going to be. By this time, we were extremely tired (especially our seven and nine year old children) as we had been in transit for more than 12 hours now. Eventually, close to midnight, we were informed that Air Mauritius had found alternative accommodation but that it was close to 90 minutes away on the east coast. We had no option but to accept this and endured the long drive to Long Beach resort to arrive well after 1am in the morning, only to be woken at 4:30am to catch the same bus back to the airport to catch the replacement flight that would leave Mauritius 9:30am the next morning.

I find the lack of information, complete incompetence and lack of customer care unacceptable during this whole process. How does one book close to 50 passengers into a hotel that has already been booked by another airline?? And secondly, how do you make travellers wait for seven hours at an airport before making the call to actually cancel the flight??",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonL5641,Jason L wrote a review Apr 2019,Jason L,"Cape Town, South Africa",2 contributions,4 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r663155787-Air_Mauritius-World.html,7 hour wait for flight to be cancelled and poor customer service,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is actually a composite review of a round trip from Chennai to Mauritius and back (Flight MK0747 and MK0746). I chose Air Mauritius mainly because it is the only airline offering a direct non-stop service from Chennai to Mauritius. It is slightly more expensive, but the saving in time and the resultant convenience was worth it.
My ticket booking experience at Chennai was very pleasant: a customer service person called Ms Sangeeta was extremely helpful in explaining the options. I was also very impressed at the efficiency of the staff at the check-in counter at SSR airport in Mauritius. Which is why I rate the friendliness of the Ground staff of this airline very high.
For some reason, the inflight entertainment in this sector seemed to offer a smaller choice than other sectors. This is something they could improve. Also, the serving of food on my return flight from Mauritius to Chennai (MK0746 was delayed. Our flight took off at around 21:15 hours but we got our dinner well past 23:00 hours, since we were in the last row (41). It is certainly not convenient to eat dinner at 23:15 !!!

When I asked if this could be fix, the cabin crew member, played about with the control, then said she would go and reset it, and come back, never see her again, all flight. About 2 hours into the flight, managed to catch the attention of another member of the cabin crew, only to be told, if I wanted to have a working screen, I would have to move into a seat in the middle of the plane.

"Ok, I tried to think of the good points of our flight, but to be honest, there wern't really any. The view out of the window at 37,000ft was interesting, but that's about it.

Where to start?

Overnight trip, so wasn't planning on doing much, have dinner, maybe a drink, but mostly sleep. Now I haven't flown Air Mauritius before, so I did check out the reviews before we left, and obviously I wasn't expecting much. To be honest, it was prwtty grim.

The plane was ancient. Air mauritius have only 12 aircraft in their fleet, and the three A340's which service the European routes were all built between 1994 and 1999. They are a quarter of a century old! Meaning the A340 we were on had close to 40 million miles under its wings and about 35,000 landing cycles. And it shows. It had ash trays! I'll just let that one sink in for a minute. Actual ash trays! The interior was just worn out. The seats were cramped and not suitable for a 12 hour flight. I'm used to long haul but this was just awful. The IFE was a joke. Not on-demand, a tiny low-res screen and no sound. Good thing I was planning to sleep for most of the flight.

Food was only just ok. Drinks were better, but only one service, I had to go the galley and ask for another glass of wine. The breakfast was inedible.

Cabin crew were ok, one was really friendly, the others just looked a bit tired and clearly didn't want to be there.

The tickets were cheap. You literally get what tou paid for. A plane that goes to Mauritius. That's it! Forget anything else.

It's cheap for a reason.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonj960,jason j wrote a review Mar 2019,jason j,Cardiff,38 contributions,26 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r658298878-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Wouldn't recommend it,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Really sadden by the fact that our flight was to take off at 13 :05 pm. We presented ourselves two hours before and came at counters. Shocked by the way the lady approaches us to tell us that our flight was going to be delayed by three hours and that we would take off at around 16 : 55 pm.
Reason of this: Yesterday (12/03/19) bad weather that persisted in Rodrigues so 2 flights were cancelled and replaced today ( Our incident day)
No clear communication has been made at disposal to advise us beforehand.
We were 7 persons including a baby of 2 months. And nothing has been put in place to prevent all this.

We payed a surplus amount of 800 Mur per persons so that we could get in to Rodrigues early but in vain.

There need to be some standards and we clients expect a really good service from our local company.

"I've booked a flight via mytrip.com online.

First, about mytrip.com:
It was the most troublesome booking I've ever made.
The online travel agency made mistakes in my e-ticket. They've never replied to my emails. They dropped my phone calls several times. They've only changed my e-ticket 6 days before departure. They claimed their company is based in UK, but the call center is based in Greece and the e-ticket were issued from New Zealand.

Now about Air Mauritus:
You now airlines company can't do much when you book your flight ticket via online travel agency. However, Air Mauritius call me and ask me if I was aware of the e-ticket problem. Air Mauritius proposed their help in contacting the travel agency. I've traveled several times with Air Mauritius in the past and I've always be happy:
Easy check-in and baggage drop
Nice plane even when you got the ATR72 from MRU to REU
Comfortable seats with good quality programs
NICE people on board that make each travel an unique experience!

"Whilst this is a non-stop flight of roughly 12hrs (better than a middle east stopover),which is much better for the kids, there were some downsides. The aircraft were pretty old and tired. For example, they had working cigarette ashtrays - it's 19 years since the USA prohibited smoking on flights. The inflight entertainment was appalling. The screens in the headrest was no bigger than 3x4"" and highly pixelated. Also, there was no seat specific ventilation. The food was pretty rough. My kids wouldn't touch it. Why is so much plastic and aluminium used in the packing. What a waste. Most people used their iPhones or iPads with preloaded movies to keep themselves entertained. Without going the Ryanair, race to the bottom route, long haul air flight needs a complete overhaul by an adventurous disrupter.

"Friendly staff, good service, not bad food either, even for all the various dietary requirements nowadays.
Selection of drinks.
Good selection on duty free products.
No cigarettes on flight for duty free.
Flights are quite old, so seats are not comfortable in economy, business is ok but still not up to date! Take your own entertainment, as the on board one is not in your control.
I’d use the flight as it’s direct to Mauritius.

"After reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned and yes the planes on this route are older than some.

However, our experience was a great one, yes the entertainment system is not on demand but the seats are wide and comfy.

We were seated in a two by the window and did notice that these seats had better legroom than the block in the middle of the plane.

Food service was efficient and drinks were available all night on request.

Packs for children and adults were handed out, the eye masks came in handy.
All in all probably the best sleep I have had on a long haul night flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miravet_Templars,Miravet_Templars wrote a review Feb 2019,Miravet_Templars,"Walsall, United Kingdom",21 contributions,18 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r654344574-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Flight to Mauritius ,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We use Air Mauritius for the first time and I must say we will try not too use them again.
All experience was horrible. I don’t even know where to start, aircraft was really old , I was surprised they still using it . Seats was really uncomfortable with basically no leg room at all , we was at 38 C D E .We didn’t realized that those seats going to be even worse than normal economy seats. My husband asked if he could move to another seat because of his DVT before, they ignore till we told we want to get off from this plane, they moved him quickly.
Me and my daughter stayed at the same seats , I actually ended up standing for a lot of time, because if person in front of me reclined his seat it was hurting my knees and was no room to move, I’m 5 ft 11 inches, or 180 cm .

Flight entertainment was basically a joke, it was very old old tiny screen little bigger then mobile phone with very bad quality picturer and films .
Service was ok .
In addition to all this it was so cold on the plane so we was actually wearing our winter coats , luckily enough I left it in my hand luggage. It’s wasn’t just us being cold and wearing coat was other passengers too was asking for extra blankets and wearing their coats.
Unfortunately if we knew what is going to be like flying with Air Mauritius we would never done it, but our travel agent had no idea that seats on that plane going to be even smaller with less legg room compare to other economy seats , trust me have 11 hours flight like this makes you wonder, how old planes have to be befor they will scrap it .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/bd/63/95/lanac79.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanac79,lana c wrote a review Feb 2019,lana c,"England, United Kingdom",30 contributions,44 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r652933511-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Bad experience,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We took Air Mauritius directly to MRU from HKG. The outbound flight was older version so it did not have our own program to watch. It has old and small screen to watch whatever was playing. But since our flight was late at night, we slept like 7hours out of 9.5 hours journey so it wasn’t an issue. The seat was comfortable with enough legs room (my fiancé is 187cm tall but he said it was comfortable). Flight attendants were friendly and helpful.

"Well, the seats were ok but very hard to recline in a comfortable position. The drinks were not flowing and I suppose due to it being a night flight everything went quiet very quickly after dinner, which was ok but not a brilliant standard.
Champagne came out of a big bottle. You didn’t get a unopened bottle of any wine like you normally do on other flights where you get an individual small bottle for yourself.

"Flew from Heathrow to Mauritius business class, really expensive tickets costing thousands.

The ads said entertainment system interactive with wifi and big seats. Liars liars liars! They ripped us off the entertainment system was from 1980 and it did not work and you cant select films which are blurred. The headphones just had feedback. Unbelievably disgusting rip off I am tempted to sue them I really am. Chicken sausage broccoli and a cold lump of messed up egg for a business class meal are you taking the ***. The staff hid for 10 hours and never asked once if we wanted anything.

Way back was a joke today 1st Feb landing heathrow 6.30am I had hoped for a new plane but no! They let more wheelchairs on the plane than a hospital would have. Then the people got up walking around no problem when they got their bigger comfy seats for nothing. There was a bloke in business class who clearly got a free upgrade and was jabbering at all the staff. See picture he is the one in the broken chair.

Offered a cheap cocktail drink asked for Champagne which should never happen and it was flat and warm. Really! Really!

The food was inedible, warm curry that looked evil. I left that food as I did not want to get ill on a 12 hour flight I was asked once if I wanted anything and then I complained about the entertainment system and the woman was not interested saying I should get in touch with the airline directly. Movies again blurred did not know what was on could not select again. Chair was uncomfortable with jerky hard edges the space was tight I am only 6foot one and the trim fell off the chair next to us which was tucked into a locker by a lazy staff member.

Basically they threw the food around turned up the heat knocked the oxygen down which gave me a headache and didn’t serve anyone for 10 hours.

They said the plane was obsolete and would be out of service soon. The thieving rip off disgusting attitude and standards is the worst I have ever experienced and if anyone bothers to read this from air mauritius i would be very surprised.

I bet they say “thank you for your comments we look forward to you flying with us again”

Im going to ask for a refund for this joke of an airline. Whats even worse is that it was booked through Virgin!

"This is the first time i have flown with air mauritius and never again! First change was the flight time, it was moved earlier then the time i orginally booked, secondly on the day of the flight, our flight was delayed for over 6 hours and lastly on the 11.5 hour flight the entertainment monitor was not working. That is the last thing i needed after a long delay. It took their staff member 3 hours to tell me it was broken, she kept saying she was resetting it, After 3 hours i had to ask her stright out, is it broken? because you've been trying to reset it for 3 hours. i'm sure if they advertise some seats may not have entertainment for 11.5 hrs they will not be my flight of choice. The air hostess, was not kind, she was looking annoyed when i asked her if it's been reset after each hour. I was more annoyed then her having no entertainment for a long flight and feeling like i'm an inconvience to her. she should have just said it was broken and should have offered me a book or something to pass the hellish long time.

"Horrible service! I sent numerous emails, I phoned the recovery department so many times regarding my flight which happened 3 weeks ago (which was delayed by almost 5 hours). And nobody even had the decency to answer one of these calls / emails! In my opinion the department does not even exist, even the manager is MIA .. The only option I have is to call call-centre agents who are not even capable of directing me to the right person, they just pass me through to another department.

We read horrible reviews online and braced ourselves for a bad flight, comforting ourselves that it would only be about four hours of suffering.

The aircraft on both legs was  a very old Airbus 300  with an entertainment system that was not on demand in either cabin, screens in economy were the size of modern mobile phone and a little larger in business. Seating in economy was a  2, 4, 2 configuration giving reasonable space and leg room that was equal to and slightly better than many other carriers.Food and drinks in economy were of a poor quality and barely edible, business class food was of a high standard with good choice of quality dishes served.The crew in both cabins were friendly and helpful though the night service in economy of soft drinks was poor, almost non existent due to what appeared to be a limited number of crew working.The airport lounge used by Air Mauritius at Heathrow is shared with other carriers and with members of the public who pay an entry fee. The lounge was very busy at times, needed more attention to cleaning and food was average, our flight was delayed 7 hours due to weather making the facility more appealing than if we only used for a couple of hours.Overall was Air Mauritius business class worth the difference in price?

"We travelled as a group of 8 people from Cape Town to Mauritius. We used Air Mauritius for both trips.

Cape Town to Mauritius:
1. The flight was delayed by two hours and no one could explain why.
2. The blankets and pillows that were provided smelled absolutely awful.
3. The food that was served on board did not look or smell good. Most of us did not eat the food. The two people in out group that ate the food had stomach problems for the next 24 hours.
4. The air hostesses were the only positive aspect about that flight. They were friendly, helpful and polite.

Mauritius to Cape Town:
1. We arrived at the airport and our flight was on schedule. We checked our luggage in and the lady at the counter informed us that the flight was going to be delayed but she was unsure how long it would be delayed and it would be best if we just waited at the gate.
2. We received our boarding passes and it stated that we must board at gate 24. We waited at gate 24.
3. The flight information board then changed to say that we are boarding at gate 26.
4. We then moved to gate 26 waiting to board.
5. The flight information board then changed again and stated that the flight will be delayed by 4 hours and we are to board at gate 19.
6. We were then informed that they were suddenly an airplane short and that was the reason for the delay.

We are still waiting to board the flight.

"The plane on departure was very new, immaculate, and we were in Row 7, the last row in Business and when food orders were taken, the only items on the menu left were fish and vegetarian, neither of which we eat.
It is unacceptable for food to run out, when the plane has not yet left the airport and it is on its initial flight and when you are paying business fares!
After some discussion, the steward went off and returned with two chicken dishes for the two of us who had not been able to order! Acceptable in the end but poor and not what we would have chosen, but better than fish or vegetarian..

"Air Mauritius is terrible. The seats have barely enough leg room for a toddler, the in-flight entertainment is worse than a publicly funded TV channel and the air-conditioning is a foreign concept, with no vents above any seats at all. I have flown all over the world in both business and economy, and I have never been in a plane as bad as an air Mauritius plane. I have been on domestic China flights that are just as bad if not better than this. I will refuse to come to Mauritius again due to this airline, 13 hours with Air Mauritius is worse than 3 flights with 4 stop overs totalling over 30 hours of flying. I feel for the staff who have to deal with such a poor working environment. After facing massive delays at Mauritius’ main airport due to a conveyor belt malfunction, causing us to wait in a long line for 2 hours and the whole plane to be delayed, as soon as we finally boarded the plane and were on the runway ready to take off, an urgent malfunction happened to occur causing us to return to the gate for what will most likely be a long time. I’m not sure how long it will be as I am writing this review as I wait, with no aircon, drinks or inflight entertainment, but I am pretty certain it won’t be quick….

Quick update 2 hours in. The inexperienced captain has provided two options. Disembark and unload the whole plane and move to another one or wait another 1-2 hours (probably 3-4 since time is also a foreign concept to this airline) for the problem to be fixed. I will now miss my interconnecting flight. This airline has single handedly ruined my holiday at the start and has done the same to the end. This holiday has been nothing but trouble and this airline was the number one cause. Save yourself the trouble. Don’t go to Mauritius. Go to Fiji or another tropical place that is the exact same and save yourself time, money and a terrible flight experience.

Another update, the captain informed us, after sitting in the plane at the gate for one and a half hours that we will now disembark and enter another plane, which started off as a one hour process. Less than a minute later we are told by the same captain, the one with no knowledge, will now be an hour and a half.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samb200801,Sam B wrote a review Jan 2019,Sam B,,1 contribution,3 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r645378984-Air_Mauritius-World.html,WORST EXPERIENCE.

First they changed our flight time to a hour later flying out & a day early coming back. We booked extra leg room seat's & on the way out we had someone sitting in the flight attendant seat so no extra leg room. Food terrible & no drink's offerd only at meal time's. On the flight back the tv was only 6in x 4in & only 4 films nothing else on it .We book with them has it was a non stop flight & thought we could sleep but with the bell going all the time people wanting drinks & no one answering it as all the crew were a sleep it didn't happen.

"Starting with positives, the airline ran both ways on time. The staff was professional and helpful. Moreover I really liked the time it departs both ways, 10 in the night. If you sleep through the night, you save a day of travel plus no jetlag when you land. Food was reasonable!

Now the negatives - the aircraft they use are really old and the entertainment system is a retro one. There is no option to choose and you're forced to watch what's running. But the cherry on the top is no functionality of pausing or stopping the series or the movie you're watching. So basically it transports you back to era that we used to live 20 years back !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swatib450,Swati B wrote a review Jan 2019,Swati B,"London, United Kingdom",3 contributions,5 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r645190970-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Good Staff but poor aircrafts,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was apprehensive to begin with when booking Air Mauritius but decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, my concerns were proved right. We flew them from Perth to Johannesburg, with a 3 day stopover in Mauritius. Upon arrival in Perth, we discovered that the inbound flight was cancelled which meant an overnight stay in Perth. The replacement flight was due to leave at 8.30am the following morning. Upon arrival to the airport we discovered this had changed to 9.30am. 20mins after boarding was due to start, the flight crew stroll into the airport lounge, none of them worrying or rushing to get going, the end result being a further 90min delay to an already 20hr delay. Upon boarding the plane, we sat down in seats that had an entertainment system from the 90s, not even worth having there. On board service consisted of a snack and drink, followed by lunch and a drink shortly after. We did not hear from the cabin crew again for another 5hrs (prepare to be thirsty). Even when pressing the button for flight crew service, nobody came to my seat to assist, with flight crew even walking straight past the service light on the panel above the seats. The end result of this experience was a planned weekend in Mauritius turning into a single day.

"We have seen the Mauritius and had by far the best vacation so far. People wearing big smiles all around. Beautiful Island and great people there. With a small child (20 months) we were hopeful that everything will be ok on our return to Paris. Flying with Air Mauritius. Yet we found that people aboard Air Mauritius are the same as on island. Very helpful, smiling all the time and making sure you are having absolutely no problems what so ever. Probably they think “you must fell special in our hands, once in Europe you are on your own.” . Nothing but the best words for the staff on board.

Long flight of some 11 hours went by rather quick. Thanks to stewardess that took special care for couples and parents of small children. There was a mother with three children just in front of us (5 years, 3 years and 5 months) and they helped here out with everything. We just had one babe and still they were of great help. Always asking if everything is ok and weather we need something. Even helping us getting an extra seat. There was a nice gentleman (must have been from Air Mauritius crew of duty that day) willing to move to another seat just to make our child’s journey easier.

Have travelled before a lot, but this was something special.

Thank you Air Mauritius.

"We had a flight from CT to Mauritius (25th December) and then back Mauritius to CT (1st January). we had mixed experiences on both legs, below are some of the issues:
1) For me overall standard, nothing special
2) On the CT-MR leg, there were three people dealing with the one flight (one was business class). check in time was un-necessarily long
3) On the flight to MR it was a new flight but legroom seemed to be an issue. the person behind me either had his legs protruding beneath my seat or int he isle
4) The seats generally hard, same for the return flight which was an older plane (more below)
5) the iphone app is okay but not great. does not always remember your details. on the return flight for example i had to re-enter all the passport details etc even though did it on the flight to MR?
6) Most international flights open 48 hours before for check in, AMR does not seem to. the App did not tell you this just said does not recognize the PRN no?
7) Service on the flight to MR was standard and i may be mistaken but am sure the attendant pulled her nose up when i asked for two cups of water (before they came around to serve)
8) On the flight CT to MR, take off is at 10pm, only one meal served on the flight
9) In terms of the kids, they received kids meals and packs which was welcome
10) on the return flight MR - CT the food service was somewhat chaotic and at one point we noticed an attendant from further in front of the plane served people he knew and as it turned out people in between were missed out!
11) on the return leg, we were meant to fly out at 4:15pm but received notification around 8am to say flight delayed. I did inquire but was not given a reason at check in why the delay. we were then ready to board at the allocated time of 6:30pm and the check in attendants were there only to be told past 6:30pm poiint that the gate had changed. this late into the game? needeless to say there was confusion as to what was priority boarding etc but the captain managed to get us to land on time despite taking off 30mins late
12) one thing other airlines do with AMR should is priority boarding for families (with young children)
13) Inflight entertainment had more varierty on the CT-MRU flight (newer plane, touch screen etc) and the return flight which had fixed time slots with fewer options.

Great for a direct flight CT to MR and back, but be prepared.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkbarA5,Akbar A wrote a review Jan 2019,Akbar A,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",37 contributions,6 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r644083106-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Only option we had,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

But the planes really need an update the seats are so small and really uncomfortable especially when you have to sit in them for 12 hours. The in flight entertainment was disappointing as well everything was so old and the screens to small to really enjoy anything anyway so didn't bother.  The food wasn't great and there wasn't a great drink selection and what they had was all poured from large bottles. If you wanted to buy duty free then you had to pre order it the truly didn't come round like it does on other airlines. I wouldn't choose to fly with this airline again but only because of these things.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/bf/ab/fb/hazel-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HazyDan,HazyDan wrote a review Jan 2019,HazyDan,"London, United Kingdom",52 contributions,74 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r643913262-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Uncomfortable Planes,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from Perth to Mauritius via Business Class.  Seats were comfortable and services were okay.  It was surprising that they ran out of Champagne very early in the 8 hour flight.  Looked as if they only had enough for the welcoming drink.  Food was average.  On the way back, we could not get business class and had to travel economy.  Main disappointment was that we had a 10 hour wait at the airport and we could not use the lounge. We had paid for it but you can only use it 4 hours before departure and there is no way to pay for additional hours.  I was also met with a very patronising person at the lounge only to be told that all lounges around the world operate like that when there are lounges around the world that allow you to pay by the hour.  The flight was also delayed.This was my 3rd trip using Air Mauritius.

"Direct flight from Cape Town to Mauritius. Flew just after 10 pm, check in, boarding went smoothly. Plane not fully booked at this time of night so easy to sleep and relax (noise levels low). Meal choices pre-booked which was correct. Mauritian cuisine spicy so pre-order bland or other option meal prior to departure if so required. Staff friendly. Bottled wine, juice and water served by the glass. Approximately 6 hr flight which went quickly and was comfortable.

Travelled to Mauritius on Air Mauritius in December 2018. Flights were well on time on both outbound (LHR - MRU) and inbound routes. Air Mauritius operates the old A340C on this route and its quite visible in terms of the cabin itself. The inflight entertainment is quite primitive as they have very small screens and there is no on demand facility. There are about 18 channels offering a choice between english/hindi and french entertainment which keep running in a loop. Seats dont offer much in terms of leg room though the configuration of 2-4-2 in economy does offer slightly more elbowroom. Crew was very helpful and courteous and the flight timings are good as you spend most of the time overnight travelling from london/Mauritius. Food is OK although i have had much better meals on other airlines.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrNavigator2k16,MrNavigator2k16 wrote a review Dec 2018,MrNavigator2k16,"London, United Kingdom",3 contributions,3 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r642690811-Air_Mauritius-World.html,First time flying on Air Mauritius !!,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is by far one of the best airlines to fly with, the food & seating are as most airlines are, however nothing to complain about. But what makes this airline stand out is the professional and friendly way in which their cabin crew work. One lady in particular, Katherina ( on the 25 December 2018 flight - cabin crew) was exceptionally kind & it was clear that she enjoyed her job, she was different from any other air hostess / cabin crew we have ever come across and truly cared about giving us a relaxing experience while up there.I am also a nervous flyer, but with her around, I just felt like everything was going to be OK.

"Like us, most passengers were flying to their holiday destinations so were already in an upbeat mood - as were the cabin staff it seemed - excited to be going home perhaps?
It's a 4 hour flight so something of a short-haul with no high expectations of lap-of-luxury travel but we were well looked-after with a ""local Mauritian"" take on Chicken Tikka eased down with (no surprise here) a cold Phoenix Beer. Why the lack of surprise? Well Phoenix is pretty much a monopoly when it comes to Mauritian beer (but, when you get a chance, seek out Flying Dodo Brewing Co. who offer a welcome alternative - Blonde, IPA, White & Nationale Craft Beers which should add some Spice of Life!). But it's not all about the beer is it? The wine was OK too!

"Stay Clear.
I have traveled for years and never have I come across a worst airline.
Now all airlines have issues but from what I gather from regulars this airline always has problems. And it's not so much about the issues themselves but how you handle them! Lies from staff about problems just produced serious anxiety with some people wanting to get off rather than fly!
Leg room was appalling! A 12hr flight with knees stuck against the seat in front is just not on.
Airplane on return was so old it still had ashtrays in the arms. 4hr technical delay and appalling coms.
Extra legroom was an exit door - leaked so Freezing cold all the way back. (My other half got pneumonia and had to go to hospital - Yes for real- can't say for sure it was directly related but it did not help)
TV's were broken or just such bad quality you could not watch anything.

"My family and I booked this trip 5 months ago to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. The tickets booked were business class and paid in FULL..

We were meant to depart on MK854 on 16 Dec at 2am and arrive in Mauritius at 8:30am. The main reason for booking such an early flight was to spend an extra day on this beautify island. I had arranged an early check in with the hotel management.

On Fri 8pm 14 Dec, I received a message that this flight will be delayed to 15:00 on 16 Dec (13 hour delay).
On 15 Dec I tried to call the airline several times but they were clueless and unhelpful. Three time they put the phone down on me. Eventually I wrote them an email but received NO response.

On 16 Dec (day of our departure), at 9am I received a message that online check in was open. I tried several times to do so but was bombed out.
At 10am we received a call informing us that the updated 3 pm flight was now rescheduled to depart at 16:20. This represented now a total of 14.5hr in delays. In addition, we have been downgraded to Economy. She gave us one option and that was to take a 1:25pm flight which was 3hours earlier than the dreaded MK854. We literally scrambled to make our way to the airport. My daughter said this was like a scene from the move “Home Alone”.
However, even on this flight we would be unable to fly economy as it was overbooked.

In all of the above, I lost both my airport transfers and incurred additional costs to make alternative transport arrangements.

In summary:
- lost one day in Mauritius (TIME)
- downgraded from Business to Exonomy (INCONVENIENCED)
- new transfer (COSTS)
- STRESS (EMOTIONAL)

We are the kind of travelers that book in advance, arrive early so that we are not stressed but based on the above, everything that went wrong went wrong.

The sad reality is that I am still waiting an official response from Air Mauritius.
The local travel agent in Mauritius himself said that he would never recommend this airline.
In my 20 trips, most of which flown on SAA or BA, I have never experienced, My WORST airline travels EVER.

At the time of writing I am yet to be responded to or reimbursed for my downgrade.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/60/avatar038.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seedat,Seedat wrote a review Dec 2018,Seedat,"Johannesburg, South Africa",54 contributions,82 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r640249265-Air_Mauritius-World.html,The most shocking experience in 20 trips to Mauritius,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Lovely airline but be careful regarding your baggage allowance. We booked via SAA and our ticket indicated two bags max weight 23kg each. I even got a mail from Air Mauritius to confirm this because we booked via SAA.  But at the check in counter Air Mauritius they informed us they changed their weight limit to 20kg per bag and we need to adhere to their baggage policy and not SAA does not matter that we booked via SAA. Nobody bothered to inform us before our flight. There was a lot of angry passengers.

"Only reason i use Air Mauritius is because of direct flights. This time I was shocked when i saw how dirty the cover was.
I was seated in the third row in business class and when i requested for fish for dinner i was told that there was no more fish on the menu. OMG you mean they keep only 2 portions for business class passengers.
But when i refused to eat something else the hostess managed to get me what i ordered.

"The plane was delayed on both flights, going into Mauritius and coming back to Perth. We were to leave at 10:15pm on a Thursday evening then told it was delayed until 1am. Last minute it was cancelled. We were given no information as to why. My family of 5 plus other passengers were forced to find a place to sleep for the night at the airport. We were given a food pass at Tropical Break. Hardly a selection. We ordered the fried rice which was not heated up. The breakfast was cheese toast and a hot beverage. My husband ordered a rock hard croissant. An awesome way to spend his birthday. We did not fly out til 10:15 AM the next day. We had to catch a connecting flight to Melbourne which we were fortunate enough that Virgin waited a little for us.

"We actually flew with air Mauritius  last year August 2017 .. we flew economy on the way there on an overnight flight 15.5 hours it was nice , a long flight and the amount of room was typical of any flight to be honest , the seats and interior of the planes are very dated (still have ashtrays one the arms of the seats ) and the TVs are about the size of an iPhone and not brilliant pictures , the staff on board where all friendly and welcoming. We got a  complementary bag on the night with basic quality socks, eye mask, earplugs and lip salve  in and we got given a blanket .. and another bag in the morning with a toothbrush and eye creams etc . The food was nice but nothing spectacular, we had an evening meal and breakfast . On the way home we travelled business class ( our holiday was won with ITV so paid for us ) and this was so much nicer , lots more room and electric seats that flatten down into beds (still dated but so much nicer )  , the tv’s are bigger , the food is a choice of menus and your meals come out with cloth napkins, silver utensils and glasses as opposed to the paper and plastics in economy ) and you get as much champagne as you would like etc . We got given blankets and pillows and a much more luxurious bag with better quality eye masks , toothbrushes and toothpaste and other small toiletries .. the staff where just as lovely as the economy class staff .. if I could afford to travel business class again I would do this every time especially for the long flights .. having said that ,economy did what it says on the tin ..Photos are of business class",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryeibhlin,kerryeibhlin wrote a review Dec 2018,kerryeibhlin,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",26 contributions,5 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r640177125-Air_Mauritius-World.html,"Economy there,  business back",Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The announcement of our flight was a shambles as the tannoy was not working well this wasn't the airline fault. However the plane was delayed but they opened the gate at the same time. There were lots of families on the flight and children were restless and noisy. We had paid  for extra leg room. When the flight finally took off. We had someone sit in the flight attendants chair ! This restricted our extra legroom as people who were queuing for the toilet were cramped in front of us. I did fall asleep when l awoke there was a young girl in the seat. She had or father had used my blanket to cover his daughter. I am a parent and Grandparent so understand caring for a child who mayor may not be ill. Not once did anybody from the flight team explain why they allowed this to happen. Even serving meals without a tray was surely against some regulation? When we came to landing lo and behold miracle cure and both father and daughter went back to their seats. The flight attendants hardly smiled or interacted with the passengers.

"I had booked a flight to Mauritius from Delhi for myself and my wife

Initial travel dates – 26th November 2018 – Morning 8 AM to 2nd December 2018 Evening 9 PM. Direct flights

Received an email just a week ago from Yatra team, (Air Mauritius team not generous enough to inform that there is any change)

That the flight has been preponed to 25th November and 2nd December morning instead of the initial schedule.

All my bookings were from 26th and the team just informs a week ago about this change

After trying to reach the customer care, which was another tedious task, and fighting for almost 2 days, the trip got planned for 25th November evening, but through a connecting flight with a lay over of 6 plus hours in Mumbai

In the expectations of not modifying the bookings for stay, I thought to go ahead with the proposed change

However, Air Mauritius team had separate plans

At 25th November evening, when I had already left for the Airport from my house, I received a phone call from your team regarding a further change and delay in flight. Now the lay over was for nearly 17 hours. And the intimation had been given so late that nothing could be done

I asked the team to kindly assist at the airport. The team provided me an email confirmation that as soon as we would reach Mumbai airport, somebody would provide the accommodation without delay



After reaching Mumbai airport, that too an hour late as the Air India flight was delayed, Air Mauritius team showed their best hospitality. NOBODY PRESENT AT THE COUNTER TO ASSIST THE CUSTOMERS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT FLIGHT WAS NOW DELAYED FOR 17 HOURS, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON TO ASSIST

We contacted the airport staff to let us out so that we could arrange an accommodation on our own, but they mentioned only the Air Mauritius team could let us out of the Airport due to security reasons. But the team was probably sleeping at that time



The team arrived at the counters at 3 AM, though the initial time of arrival should have been much earlier

After another fight, the team made arrangements for the stay at a nearby hotel



Even the next day, the flight had taken off after a further delay of another hour



Monetary loss faced -



Reaching Mauritius at midnight (Indian time). All the cabs which we had booked initially had gone because of the delays made in the arrival. Had to find another cab at a much higher price

One day of stay totally lost

All activities of the first day which had been a part of the itinerary lost and had to be paid for again on other days

"It's been my first journey with this company and it's been surprisingly a great flight! The cabin was very clean and spacious, the service has been perfect, the toilets were quite clean and the entertainment was excellent. I traveled in Economy class and I felt pampered anyway. Only the food left me somehow not so satisfied, because it was not so tasty and the dessert was really poor.
The only remark I would like to add is that there was a poor little girl screaming for a very long time (maybe her hears were hurting?), the mother was unable to deal with her and I hoped an hostess would show up to offer some extra support but it didn't happen...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/af/09/78/sveva-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevaMati,Sacred Journeys wrote a review Dec 2018,Sacred Journeys,"Rome, Italy",194 contributions,121 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Paris,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r637052374-Air_Mauritius-World.html,An unexpected perfect flight,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew in business class to Mauritius, a bit of a treat really and one of the problems resulting from using business class for business flights!

The highlight of air Mauritius is their friendly and polite cabin crew. It is so refreshing to see a friendly and attentive crew. This makes up for the few shortfalls which would have otherwise resulted in a 1 star rating (for business class).

The shortfalls:
- The bed is not flat. It is at an angle which meant that one is prone to sliding down. -The flights were overnight 13 hours so this was an important issue.
- The media facility was a little outdated and felt old. Nevertheless, the space and cleanliness was excellent and at least the media worked!
- I could not have my meal choice as there was none left. Whilst a risk in economy I consider this as unacceptable in business class (please remind me what the airfares were again?!🤔).

Whilst the shortfalls don’t mean I won’t fly Business Class with this airline again we will defiantly search out alternatives.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1707,J1707 wrote a review Nov 2018,J1707,,14 contributions,20 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r636636786-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Friendly service but falling short on essentials,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This has been worst airlines /aircraft I had ever traveled.
It was a small and old model air craft A340-XX with no proper leg room space, lack of tasty meal

Inflight entertainment:
We got booked 3 seats out of which for 2 of them in flight entertainment was not working at all.
And the 1 which was working is such an old fashioned 80's model, that it was appearing in b&w instead of color, no touch screen option.
Cannot even watch a movie of choice, it is like watching tv program (which you cannot go back/forward or pause)

Luckily for our son we did took our tablet which came very handy during the journey.

Staff: I had no issues with any of them, all were polite and friendly.

And mind you, cost is not cheaper. It is very difficult 13 hour + journey on this flight

"Was really disappointed with this flight, was so looking forward to it after reading great thing about Air Mauritius.
The plane was spotlessly clean and the staff were professional, but that was it.
As normal you cant order a nut free meal, so the food is a lottery, what is surprising is the crew didn't know the ingredients, I found them out myself. The food was nothing special,
This flight was the 11 hours and in that time had 2 cups of coffee, 1 glass of water and 1 drink. I suppose I could have pinged the bell for more but the lady serving my section appeared to be one speed.
One of the longest flights I have had and very disappointed in the level of service, The cabin crew just seamed the do the minimum then disappear.

"We landed in MRU this morning (19 Nov 2018) and I wanted to write this review since.

We had been dreading to get on the flight as this was the first time we were doing it as a young family with a 4 month old baby. I have to say, we were really pleasantly surprised by the attention and care we received during the whole flight.

The flight itself was uneventful, with everything going to plan inflight.

However, the level of care received was, as far as we are concerned, amazing. One of the staff ( I believe his name is David) was the best cabin crew I have come across in a very very long time. David was friendly, attentive to our plight and also very understanding. Not saying the rest of the cabin crew was not good. They were all really good.

"Where to start, I do not even know. On November 3rd, 2018, I took the 10pm flight from Mauritius to London Heathrow on the way to Calgary concerning a business matter. When I boarded the plane, the seat that i was assigned to was filthy. Looked like they did not even clean the plane well for the next service from the flight before. Vomit stains were on the seat, the neck rest was missing, the seat smelled like a dead corpse, and to top it off, the food. Wow, to say that Mauritius is a resort paradise island. Food in the hotels are great, but the same food in the airplane is crap. I ordered the lamb option and god it was cold, even after reheating it in the plane. Asking for water was like asking for someone's liver. I heard the steward saying "" sa gogot la bizin delo. Guette ene coutte ki to capave fer pou li. "" i also spent almost a quarter of my flight time in the bathroom after eating food on the plane. At a tea/coffee service provided, the steward serving the tea or coffee had his belly on my face and I would most likely guess that his butt was on the other passenger's face. I travel back to Mauritius from Calgary via London Heathrow at the end of the month. I cannot fathom the flight, like I know that it is going to be a nightmare, and still I have no choice but to bear with it.
Trip Advisor should have a rating where it says No Stars and Unrated due to the kind of service provided by these airlines. I am ashamed to say that the Airline carries the name of the country which is known for its hospitality, but as a National Carrier from a Mauritian's point of view, I cannot even rate you. Again, with this kind of service, Air Mauritius is rated Best Airline in the Indian Ocean. Again, it is a big lol.

"I have been in many many flights including Australia 3 times and i can honestly say Air Mauritius has been the worst. The plane A320-300 is far so cramped for a long haul. I came home yesterday and I'm aching all over were i couldn't move sitting in the chair. Even getting out of the chair was an effort. And the service was disgusting! You got 2 meals with drinks for a 12 and half hour flight. Other than that you were not offered even water to hydrate your self. With Qatar Airways last year we were offered so much food/snacks/drinks between meals it was amazing. But Air Mauritius was just appalling. And at the airport coming home there was no announcement of our flight delay of nearly an hour! Then there was no announcement when they were boarding, luckily we were able to see the queue moving so we joined but it was a free for all! No rows of certain numbers to board in turn to make it organised like other flights. On the flight out from Heathrow to mauritius we had 3 naughty young children in the row in front of us, no one could get a wink of sleep. People were complaining but nothing was done, the parents were in upper class so they weren't being supervised at all. They even had a food fight. I had asked one of the attendants if they could get their mother to talk to them but she just said the mother was asleep and didn't want to disturb her! Didn't matter that no one else could sleep!

Online check-in was completed easily prior to leaving home and the whole experience at Heathrow airport with the airline was absolutely fine. We flew direct and overnight.

Booked extra leg room seats but upon checkin were told the seats had simply been resold to another passenger ... sorry - you will be refunded.  Refund took over a month to receive.  Air Mauritius were hopeless at communicating would not respond to emails and calls not answered.  In flight they are average at best - not the most comfortable.  Food is ok.

"Just flown back today on the A340 from Mauritius in Economy disgusting. I am not a big person and only just over 5ft. So cramped couldn't even reach down to pick up a bottle of water that I dropped. If the seats in front are reclined your tray table will just about pull down, in your stomach, not enough room to place a napkin on your lap. Getting out to use the toilets difficult especially if you are sitting in a window seat.

"Boarding in Mauritius was chaotic, staff were screaming stuff in French only so 3 quarter of the passengers seemed to speak French.

The flight was on their latest A350. After takeoff dinner wich was absolutely disgusting, borderline dogfood) and a drink were served and then the crew turned off the lights and disappeared. There was no bar to get drinks etc. Halfway trough the flight a flight attendant came trough the isle with water. She moved at a pace even speedy Gonzales would be jealous of, ignoring passengers who wanted water. Tried to call a crew member with the call sign about 7 times, it got turned of remotely 7 times and saw the same thing happen to others passengers.
Brealfast was served which was a little better than the dinner.
The crew looked and acted very disinterested, some even walking around with a resting b!tch face.

The flight started bad when checking in as they could not understand there are two people with similar names in the family. On the plane the service was poor we had a baby the little cot wasn't set up we had to ask for it to be set up. We had lots of bags for the baby they did not want anything standing on the floor so we had to stow everything away and if you have a baby you would know you need a lot of stuff all the time from the nappy bag. The manner in which they speaked to us wasn't polite at all and we didn't appreciate it. Is was freezing inside the plane we asked them to turn it up a little which they did but it was still freezing so we asked for blankets. The response was sorry we don't have enough blankets but almost all the blankets went to business class passengers so we just had to take out all the jackets we could find to cover up. Just not the service we are used to the plane was also old and outdated with no legroom at all the headphone unit did not work the tray for the food also was broken on my side. I stood up as the legroom was so little and walked around a bit and the first flight attendant that saw me asked me to go sit down. We are flying to Mauritius again in March 2019 this is the last chance for them to prove to me they are up there with the best!

"After a great Virgin flight from Sydney to Perth to connect with MK441 we were underwhelmed on boarding this business class flight to Mauritius. The plane appeared quite old and the seat fittings were rather tatty and worn, decor was a rather dreary brown and cream. A request for white wine 'drink on boarding' was flatly refused ""champagne, juice or water""! After takeoff the crew were taciturn, seemed not to want to be there,  and a smile would have been a rare event. It just got worse as the flight progressed, the entire crew became preoccupied with two families with babies in the bassinet rows to the exclusion of the rest of the cabin. I'd like to think they were trying to keep the babies quiet to avoid disturbing the rest of us, but what they did was way above and beyond the call of duty - like grandparents doting over grandchildren. The rest of us were secondary. I was not impressed. Whatever happened to parental responsibility? Otherwise, the food and wine were good, entertainment ok and the toilets were kept clean and tidy. Flight was on time too. I've done business class on many airlines and I'd put this flight in the bottom 20%.

"If you at all able to, see if you can book a flight on the brand new A350 jet. Very spacious in economy with excellent large screen entertainment unit. Very responsive. Free wifi was advertised in the flight but was we weren’t able to connect.

Lots of foot space since the pc boxes are now located in the seats and have been reduced in size.

In flight service was decent. Definitely try the local Phoenix beer. Food was good standard economy fare. You can book a specific type of dietary requirement meal online. Eg low-sodium or low carb etc. Kids get goodie bags.

Remember to check in online to avoid being bumped off an overbooked flight.

On the way back we were on the much older A340. These screen were very small and unclear, remotes very dated, no entertainment menu choices. Sadly this disappointed me a little given how AWESOME the A350 was.

Flew on the new A350 - the seats are excellent with plenty of space although foot space is a bit tight with the seat fully flat. Food and service were ok although by the time they reached us in row 7 the choice of main meal was down to 2 and the attendants were losing interest.

"New Airbus A350, enough leg space, comfortable seats, delicious food and exellent crew service. Gifts for the child. For all, they gave sets with earplugs, eye caps, small toothbrushes for the morning and toothpaste. Blanket and such warm socks for the night :) In the morning a warm towels to wash your face - very nice.

"I actually flew with Mauritius Airways in August 2016 when I went on my honeymoon but have only just got round to writing the review.

I'll start with the positive. The check in process was quick, efficient and the staff we dealt with were very, very friendly, and we chose Mauritius Airways because at the time, it was the only option to fly direct. The other option was Emirates via Dubai but that put a good 4-5 hours on the journey time. The flight was on time, and we also got given a little personal hygiene kit including a tooth brush and a few other bits, which was a nice touch. The food was also ok as far as airline food goes.

That's where the good stuff ends I'm afraid.

Firstly, for a long haul flight, there wasn't a lot of leg room. It's the least I've ever had for a flight over 6 hours. The interior of the plane was a bit old and tired, and it wasn't particularly comfortable. But, the biggest thing was the in flight entertainment. The flight was advertised with a selection of films, hence I left my books in my checked in luggage. The Entertainment systems were the old-school screens you used to get in the late 80's and hadn't been updated, which in itself wasn't the end of the world, but 2 thirds of them (including mine) didn't work. The screen didn't even turn on. My wife's did, but there were about 15 channels that didn't run on demand, but simultaneously, so when they reset the system every half an hour (as they did for the first 4 hours) everyone watching a film had to start again. The passengers were getting angry and it was obviously a long standing problem as the crew were well drilled in dealing with the complaints. After dealing with about 200 angry passengers, the cabin crew just vanished, obviously wanting to avoid the conflict and this went on for about 3 hours, in which time we couldn't even get a drink.

In summary, I had paid for a seat with in flight entertainment which I didn't get. I complained several times and got nothing more than ""sorry"". 13 hours is a long flight with nothing more than the safety card to entertain you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/903adrianb,Adi B wrote a review Oct 2018,Adi B,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",34 contributions,23 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r623742181-Air_Mauritius-World.html,No entertainment,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well.Air Mauritius is supposed to be MY COUNTRY's NATIONAL AIRLINE.51 years.But will it ever grow to become a better airline?.And as I don't wish to be seen as being the black sheep of my countrymen,and I am not the only one you just have  to read all these negative reviews from people all over the world who happened to fly Air Mauritius.My review: I will just  leave it to my overall ratings which speak for themselves.But I like it (the airline).Not those who think that they know better  concerning the running of IT.I am a loyal Mauritian national even if I have a dual citizenship.That is why I kept flying Air Mauritius even if it is the laughing stock of the world.Unfortunate for me and for those Mauritians who fly this company.Stewards tried to compensate any shortage of food or beverage by a smile.Unfortunately it is not a nice smile when you are told that there's no more milk on board.And we are cruising at 33,000 ft. And obviously no supermarket around the corner.What a pity!!I understand any business need to be profitable,but not at the expense of paying passengers.In contrast,flying Virgin's same type of plane was a pleasure.Better stop here as I don't want to have a heart attack.

"So i flew Air Mauritius from Perth to Mautitius in one of the Airbus A330-200. At the time there was a pilot strike which affected my flight time quite a bit. That was already annoying, waiting 6 or so hours instead of 3 in Perth (since i flew from Melbourne). One good thing, I was given a voucher to get some food, ample enough to have a good meal. That’s when the good sort of stops. On board of the A330, well the seats are... outdated... thick spongy padding on the seats made the seats more uncomfortable and sacrificed a fair amount of legroom. I was lucky that the seat next to mine was unoccupied and could put my feet up. The contrast between the Air Mauritius plane and the Virgin Australia (the carrier that I took from Melbourne to Perth) one was like night and day, despite the fact that both aircrafts were of the same type (both A330-200’s). One looked and felt nice, the other (Air Mauritius)..... not so much. Food, I was kept well fed on board so I’m not going to complain.... could have been better, but seriously though it’s airplane food - economy class airplane food - you get what you pay for, I had the pleasure of enjoying a couple of glasses of whisky and coke so that was better that you’d get on many airlines. Seriusly though!

"These clowns damaged my case - and not just a little bit. Absolutely trashed it - it was obviously driven over. Trying to buy a replacement case in Mauritius is not easy or cheap but they wouldn't pay for the one we bought, nor the taxi we took to get it and no mention of the morning of our holiday we wasted (which we weren't claiming for anyway). On top of that, they offer $20 for all the things that were missing that came to over £400.

Even without smashing my case to bits and losing my luggage, the service on the flight was appalling - we had to keep going to the back of the plane where the attendants were all sitting and laughing if we ever wanted a cup of water for our children. The service was non existent. The TV kept freezing and please take your own headphones (if you're mad enough to fly with them) otherwise you'll be watching a silent movie with their cheap plastic things.

Our fight from Johannesburg to Mauritius was good with the new aircraft we had inflight entertainment and individual screens which was great. The food was ok however I do recommend kids book child meals as the standard meal was fairly spicy. Staff were always very friendly and the kids are spoiled with goodie bags with lots of fun things to do and souvenirs to keep. Coming back to Johannesburg however was disappointing as the aircraft was old with very limited space between each seat. The person in front reclined and I had my tray basically on my lap. No individual screens or entertainment and none of our headsets worked. The arrival times in Mauritius are horrible. Immigration is very slow. We arrive at the hotels just before dinner closes at 10pm or sometimes even after if you coming from a shuttle which has dropped guests elsewhere first. Departure times from Mauritius are equally horrific. Those on shuttles have to leave the hotels by 5am which means they up around 4am. Private transfers or taxis in this case are better to leave hotels at 6am to be at the airport by 7am. Departure time is way too early and a major disappointment for people visiting the island as they lose time on the first and last day.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/1b/68/cf/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doriane76,Doriane76 wrote a review Sep 2018,Doriane76,"Leiria, Portugal",120 contributions,15 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r618923470-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Average ,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We (self and wife) traveled in Air Mauritius from Chennai to Mauritius and back on 21.8.2018 and 27.8.2018. The flight maintained its timings. The onboard service were excellent.

The seats are on the smaller size but hubby and i were comfortable, usual restricted leg room etc but no worse than any other airline internal within Oz.  The aircraft had received a refit so new large touch screen tv with a decent selection of movies, tv channels, music.  You do only get two choices for lunch, but they were delivered quickly and came with dessert and drinks.  The cabin crew frequently circulated with water and soft drinks and a decent snack was served prior to landing.

"We have flown Air Mauritius to Mauritius for some years now. The earlier flights were satisfactory with cabin crews that were very attentive, and good food. The two constant complaints have been that in Business Class the seats are not fully flat, resulting in slippage down . And the in flight entertainment is well below the standard of other airlines. But overall an OK experience.
However our last trip in July/August was a poor experience for our family party of 10 including 4 young children. On the flight out they had no food for two of the children in spite of it being pre booked. The cabin crew member was abrupt when this was brought to her unfortunately attention, and eventually brought two adult meals which were still partially frozen!

The food in Business Class is now not as good as it was in our earlier flights, overall not the same standard or variety.

On check in for the return flight the family booked in Economy had to queue right at the back instead of priority boarding despite another family being allowed to board early

On the return flight my wife and I had precooked the seats together but were separated on different rows. After complaining about this we were eventually reseated together.

The rest of the family were in Economy and two adults and two children were not in their pre booked seats and had been relocated to the back row with non reclining seats to accommodate another family who wanted to sit together.

The cabin crew on the return flight did their best to recover the situation but the family experience was a poor one

Air Mauritius have bought new planes with fully flat seats, and our travel agent was told they would be in service to Mauritius, but instead they were in service elsewhere.

Unfortunately Air Mauritius will not be our first choice of airline to Mauritius in the future",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keekee27,keekee27 wrote a review Sep 2018,keekee27,United Kingdom,78 contributions,87 helpful votes,East Midlands - Mahebourg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r617640831-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Disappointing,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It is important to note that this is the budget option for young South African families travelling to Mauritius on package holidays. Avoid at all costs if flying from SA or upgrade to business class to preserve your sanity. Our flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. What followed was pure torment - 5 hours of over-tired babies and toddlers wailing and struggling. The seating was very cramped and the outdated on-board entertainment (straight from the 1990´s) would drive one to drink but for the refreshment trolley rarely making an appearance. The food is decidedly average and cabin service lacks that touch you will experience with premium airlines i.e. Emirates.

"We travelled to Mauritius for our 35th wedding anniversary and upgraded to business class, good job we did. Although business class was a lot better than economy which we travelled on the way back and will not do again, it was nice but not as nice as I expected it to be. Coming back to Perth in economy was an absolute nightmare, small seat, cramped space, VERY old fitout. I think it is about time Air Mauritius spent a bit more money and put it back into the planes they expect people to travel on. Our seats were uncomfortable, the tv did not work, food was not the best, not a lot of good things to say about the actual flight.

"The size of plane on this route seems to be rather variable as we know friends who flew on a much smaller plane a few weeks earlier, but we had an A320 on the outward journey and an A340 on the return.  Both planes had capacity for far more passengers than actually flew, the A340 being no more than 25% full. Check-in was smooth and uneventful.  Business class on the outward journey was delightful - huge arm chair-like seats widely spaced in the cabin, incorporating a massage option and various seat positions. The cabin staff were immaculate, and served us a carton of tropical fruit drink during the 30 minute flight. Economy on the way back was just as pleasant. What fun to be on a flight which begins its descent within 20 minutes of take-off. We had the same pilot/co-pilot on both occasions, and both times they had trouble lining the plane up at the air bridge, so it took almost as long to de-plane as it took for the flight itself, but otherwise a very professional airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenniw430,Jenni w wrote a review Sep 2018,Jenni w,"London, United Kingdom",19 contributions,20 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Saint-Denis,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r617553394-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Big plane for a short journey,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We chose Air Mauritius for the one reason and that it was a direct flight, but never again! It was the most miserable 24 hours of our lives if you consider there and back, although they did get us to our destination. There is no leg room (and I am short), the seats are hard, your foot space is impeded because of the box under the seat in front. The food is of a poor quality and frankly inedible. The entertainment screen is the worst of any airline I have flown with and the choice of films poor. The headphones are of the cheapest variety so much so that despite the fact I did not want to watch anything provided, I still had to endure hours of the noise from my fellow passengers from what they were watching?    Whilst they did what they were supposed to do, the flight stewards acted liked they wanted to be somewhere else and they could hardly muster a smile between them, quite the opposite of the people we encountered on the island for the 2 weeks we were there. We were given blankets on boarding and believe me you need them, as it is the coldest flight flight you will experience, it was freezing all the time the lights are out, which is the majority of the flight!  If you are considering a stopover for a couple of hours with any other airline then take it, as apart from getting you there and back a little quicker you will get very little other comfort from AM?Never again!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/df/53/cc/johacs.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnoP5759FH,John O wrote a review Sep 2018,John O,"Kent, England",26 contributions,8 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r617523711-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Never again,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelled to Mauritius over summer holidays with my husband and children.
Very very little leg room even for economy - on outward flight there was something in the middle of seat in front so you couldn’t even put feet out to under that seat.
The inflight entertainment was one which showed on a loop, so if you missed the start of film it was bad luck (although you could watch again on the flight as it would be repeated on loop during the duration of the flight)!

"Pathetic service from Air Mauritius. Stood in such a long queue even though we checked in online (there should be a separate queue for bag drop off). A very unfriendly woman served us. I've forgotten her name unfortunately. But we travelled on the 1/08/2018 and she had short boy cut hair. She made us remove the wrapping on our bags and open them just to move 1kg from one bag to the other. She said once we're done we can come straight back to her. But after 5 minutes when we were done she made us stand in the queue again because she said she's leaving. She was so rude to us as well. Very very pathetic. Why work in the service industry if you don't know how to be friendly. Because of her we missed our chance to sit in the First class lounge before boarding. Saw her again before getting on the plane she was guiding passengers to the correct door for economy and business class.

"Air Mauritius offers a practical option for travel between Perth and Mauritius, and reasonable value. The Airbus 330-200 planes flying this route have recently been revamped into a 1-2-1 configuration in business class. However, the revamping is not perfect. When lying down on the flat seats, one's lower half is in a somewhat ""bent"" position, and the space is very narrow, making it near impossible to turn. The food and beverages are barely OK, with the wines disappointing on the palate and instant coffee served instead of percolated coffee (oh dear, undrinkable!).

The plane, an Airbus was not full and I think it would be problematic if that was the case as the aisles seemed a tad narrower than normal.

"Firstly, going to Mauritius from Perth wasn't too much trouble but on the flight back, crew refused to push daughter who can transfer herself from seat to cabin wheelchair.

Expectation was for the crew member to push to the toilet door and back. They cited airline procedures about unable to lift passengers when clearly we explained that wasn't needed. After several minutes of arguing, even the flight purser said the same and even gave the example of another passenger that wasn't allowed fly as she was on her own, comments like disabled people need to travel with a doctor, nurse or carer.

Clearly their training is not adequate and one flight to another, there's inconsistency and you're lucky to fly with the knowledgeable staff who can differentiate between passenger needs and apply correct procedures.

I ended up having to push my daughter with his toddler brother in my arms. The crew told me wasn't medically trained and hence couldn't operate the cabin wheelchair 😂 yet she assumed as a father/carer I had to be trained medically as I had to push the wheelchair onboard an aircraft in flight.

I'd avoid if you have limited mobility, not worth the trouble and drama. Far better airlines to pick from.

Complaint was cookie cutter replies, same citiation of airline procedures aboit lifting, didn't address the conernong fact that parents were asked to manipulate aircraft equipment, especially how unsafe it was to be expected to do so carrying a toddler. Apparently crew told at their investigations that they provided the assistance, clearly saving their interests and not assuming responsibility for their actions, which to me says nothing will change.

Overall, food is average, leg space is too. Customer service depends on who you end up with.

Airport services in Mauritius at the boarding gates and check-in are very good, assistance is provided to push passengers in wheelchairs and to collect luggages and provide priority processing through immigration.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5813WOrubenr,Ruben R wrote a review Sep 2018,Ruben R,,1 contribution,,Mahebourg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r613111797-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Not recommended for disabled travellers,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight was on the thursday 22nd of August. We had left from Cape town that morning on a British Airways flight at 9 am and arrived on time at Johannesburg to take our Air Mauritius flight MK0852 at 13hr35 on A319. At the Air Mauritius checking the lady informed us the plane would be there at 18hrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We were shocked.We went to complain and only after that the lady in charge told us we could have lunch tickets for ZAR 150. for lunch per person. Well we could do nothing but wait. While waiting I went to a board to check if anything was mentioned about our delayed flight and wow surprise, it announced 40 more waiting hours!!!Our plane actually took off at 7pm South African time and landed in Mauritius at half past midnight Mauritian time.........On board we got apologies for the delay and surprise no choice for the menu but a very spicy briani which burnt the mouth which we could not eat.................So diner consisted of starter hum......a piece of bread and cheese and a veeeerry sweet dessert.

Do not fly air Mauritius.  Very old plane.  Engine fumes during take-off. Most of the staff are extremely rude  - passengers an inconvenience. Food below average. Seats very uncomfortable.

"I've flown several times on Air Mauritius between Asia and South Africa. Economy seats are pretty tight except on the A340`s. Business on the other hand is surprisingly good - comfortable seats  for sleeping and reasonably priced fares. Food is OK and service is pretty casual but friendly. There's one reason I'm reluctant to continue using them and although it's not the airline's fault it does make for an unpleasant experience when flying via Mauritius.  I've flown to over 100 airports and Mauritius airport has the rudest, most unfriendly passport control officials I've encountered. I know it's not their job to be pleasant, and although I've never been delayed, each time I've been taken aback by their obnoxious manner. Unfortunately it leaves a bad taste after each flight so it kinda makes flying Air Mauritius not worth it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettC805,Brett C wrote a review Aug 2018,Brett C,"Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa",23 contributions,19 helpful votes,Singapore - Durban,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r609964499-Air_Mauritius-World.html,"Nice enough little airline, pity about the RUDE airport",Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"When I flew into Mauritius it was a pleasant Sunday on the A350. What a flight. For the business traveller it has everything in economy. Decent legroom and good inflight. The WiFi was not connected but I can manage without. On the return leg, it was an absolute nightmare. Air Mauritius fly a A319 and the only part of comfort is discomfort. There was not a spare seat on the plane, no space for baggage, a movie which didn't work so the speakers were on the overhead. For 4hrs and 45mins and the cost of the flight, there is zero value. I have to say that if I am to fly to Mauritius again, I will choose my days carefully. The staff are very pleasant, and appear quite embarrassed about the age and state of the service. Food and everything was good. Just make sure A319 is from the 80's and not something a business traveller should have to endure.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E210VZrobh,E210VZrobh wrote a review Aug 2018,E210VZrobh,"Harare, Zimbabwe",8 contributions,3 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r609812207-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Check which aircraft is flying before you book Air Mauritius,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well, one seems to think that if you have an island and one airline, you could either be complacent and serve whatever you like or be the absolute best from start to finish.  Being a double platinum flyer of SkyTeam in one year and senator on Star Alliance the same, there are comparisons to make and this is not a blog about a one-time experience. Nobody actually goes out there to give you a bad experience but it usually comes down tom leadership and management.  A good motivated purser on a plane can make a world of difference.Specifically for Air Mauritius it’s a tale of two parts, as we flew Business Class out MK844) and Economy class back.  But here goes…Firstly, the International Lounge in cape Town was not on top form having many outages, such as the coffee machine, which is not the most convenient.  Eggs could possibly be bounced off rubber walls and no staff available.  Either way, a vent, but not Air Mauritius problem at this point.Business Class was truly disappointing.  There was no priority boarding and having asked a staff member, he didn’t even listen and directed us to the Economy Queue.  This is not unusual with airlines when travelling with a family., but it seems Air Mauritius would like to enforce this type of stereotyping.  It doesn’t end there.  Boarding the plane with a family of four in Business Class, after asking where the priority Queue was didn’t get any better.  In actual fact, our 13 year old daughter, who boarded first,  was sent to the Economy section without the steward even looking at her boarding pass.  I had to call her back to row 6.  We got no apology.  The service was way below par and started with myself getting skipped the first drinks service with no apology when complaining.  A simple "" what do you want"" seems good enough for Business Class passengers.In addition, our choices were out before meal service.  We understand that this could be a common phenomenon on flights but a short flight to Mauritius should cater for most.  Nevertheless, simple service breaches were consistent.  My wife wasn’t feeling well and two hours into the flight pushed the call button.  This button remained on until landing.  Totally ignored by Business Class flight attendants.I must say that the flight was a disappointment and will not be a further choice or recommendation.  To be honest, our economy return flight had more attentive staff and faster service.  It seems that if you want to save a few thousand dollars and are forced to fly economy on air Mauritius, this would be a better choice!  This goes with the exception of my neighbours armrest flying off and landing on my foot. :-) Also note that you can only use your Skyteam Platinum cards for Air Mauritius if you are flying on an Air France Flight, although announcements on the plane include Air France.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/c2/37/ac/cmunn.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMUNN,CMUNN wrote a review Aug 2018,CMUNN,"Budapest, Hungary",160 contributions,78 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r609740937-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Dissapointing and Can Do Much Better,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Terrible service from flight attendants after a passenger was caught red handed smoking an e-cigarette mid flight. How he managed to get that on the flight in the first place is a mystery.

There was no consideration for people flying with chest problems - like my daughter. What would have happened if she had a asthma attack mid flight?

I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the standard of  Air Mauritius standard. The food was quite nice and the fact that you could watch movies or many of the other entertainment helped to make the 4 hour flight pleasant and short.

"Feels a bit old-school these days: dated plane and in-flight services.  Staff were very friendly, food was fine.  On the way out, the seat reclined to near-flat but then refused to come back up - had to move seat away from my wife.  On the return flight the entertainment system is not on-demand so you have to ‘catch’ the start of whichever film you want to watch or wait for it to come around again (there’s no entertainment info though so you don’t know what’s on) - screen quality very poor so I just didn’t bother.As we were flying on to La Reunion I had booked, and paid for, the lounge at Mauritius because there was a good 3-hour wait and after 11.5 hours of flying it seemed worth it.  Plane was 2 hours delayed out of Heathrow (these things happen) and by the time we got through security it was straight on to the connection.  Air Mauritius customer service is non-existent: no response to emails or anything so attempting to get a refund is impossible.I wouldn’t fly with them again until they change to newer planes and get a grip on customer service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyJ_8,AndyJ_8 wrote a review Aug 2018,AndyJ_8,London,12 contributions,17 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r604152891-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Not the best really,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In short it was like flying on a soon to be retired Blackpool donkey!

The plane was tired, the seats were quite honestly the hardest and most uncomfortable I have ever endured. I thought the best way through it would be to have a beer!! Good luck with that... water was sparse!!! The food was awful. And to top it off the stewards/stewardesses were incredibly grumpy!

We even paid for extra leg room! Hahahahaha £240 for sod all! In fact water came through the exit door on landing!!

I am not mentioning the “entertainment” - in fact through writing this review if we ever go back to Mauritius I will be opting for the Blackpool donkey!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/79/81/18/tim-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muggers121,Tim M wrote a review Aug 2018,Tim M,"Rochester, United Kingdom",23 contributions,9 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r603934582-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Air Mauritius - More like Air Hideous!,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked our holiday to Mauritius through Virgin, who said we would need to travel in Air Mauritius or would have to change somewhere with another airline! We agreed as surely a long haul airline would be good!?

I read some reviews on here and it sounded terrible! I booked exit seats for my husband and I, which were not cheap- about £240 for both of us both ways.

When we boarded the plane, it was obvious it was old because of the decor! Our exit seats were ok- one excellent, the other had part of the emergency door in the way! But ok!

The staff on the plane were friendly enough but it look a long time to get a drink- my tip would be take some drinks with you! They do come round eventually but plastic cups are small and I did feel very dehydrated when I got off the plane!! Food was ok! Had dinner and breakfast as it was a night flight!

The seat was terrible- so uncomfortable!! Worst seat I’ve ever had! And for a 11.5 hour flight it was bad! In flight entertainment was via a very dated system! We didn’t bother and watched a film on iPad!!

The best bit was that when we were about to land, some small drops of water seemed to be coming from somewhere near the emergency door- never seen that before!!

I know Air Mauritius have two new planes but they don’t seem to use them on the London- Mauritius route!

All I’d say is know what you will get! It’s great as it’s direct flight but not a great 11.5 hours of your life believe me!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/99/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieDockers,JulieDockers wrote a review Aug 2018,JulieDockers,"Kent, England",67 contributions,57 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r603231556-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Where do I start!!!,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The airplane has been retrofitted and the legroom is more spacious. There was a wider choice of inflight entertainment. Two meals were served. For lunch, the food was reasonable but for the dinner, steamed chicken was served with rice and it was uneatable. Moreover, the plane was almost full of passengers and there was one lavatory  out of order. There were most of the time long queues of passengers waiting near the lavatories.

"The plane is very much dated on this route.
This is a 20 year old Airbus with none Flat beds in business!
The entertainment system is even more outdated, NO video on demand, just 15 channels that show movies.
The food is okay, but certainly not great.
Be aware that although this is a 12 hour flight, no ""dinner"" is served although the landing is at 18.55! Just a ""sandwich"" that is rather dry.
The service was very nice and really took an effort in compensating for the bad plane

"The crew were all very friendly and helpful, and the level of service was great. Check in and boarding was easy and smooth.

However, the planes seemed very old, dated and worn and were not very comfortable (which makes a difference on a 12 hour flight).

On the outbound journey our entertainment systems did not work, and the temperature in the cabin was way too hot.

On the return journey the entertainment system worked and the temperature was better, but there was very little legroom - I am 6ft tall (i.e. fairly normal height) and could not sit without my knees touching the seat in front. Also, my headrest was broken and wouldn't stay up, meaning I couldn't rest my head properly to sleep comfortably.

"Left Perth Sunday the 22nd of July at 2.10 pm.
That is an hour and 5 minutes late.
That can happen to any other airline company.
But then to say we have a slight delay because of refueling !!!!
I don't think so, not a prudent thing to do with 200 people on board and to refuel a plane.
Real reason was they were waiting from a connection flight from Sydney that was running 2 hours late. They should have left us in the lounge area for another hour, as the flight from Sydney or Melbourne is a 4 hour flight they knew this in advance.
No drinks were offered and twice I asked could they at least turn on the movies, but no feedback at all and no movies.
Same with the landing, they collected the headphones 25 minutes before landing, why? Even with your own head phones they did kill the movie 20 minutes before landing.
One a last point, their entertainment system comes out of NOAH's ARC.
I haven't seen a screen like that for at least 12 years at least. If I was the CEO of Mauritius Airlines, I would be embarrassed to have those planes in my fleet.
In case of an emergency there is very little chance of survival between Perth and Mauritius, 9 hour flight. You would want to have a newer aircraft on this route.

"Having flown with Air Mauritius to Malaysia, we also booked flights from Johannesburg to Perth. The 3 hour stop-over in Port Louis gave us a great break and made the journey seem much shorter. 4.5 hours from JNB to MRU and under 6 hours from MRU to PER definitely beats a direct flight of 10 hours

Boarding procedure in JNB was very good but onboard service on the JNB route was average and staff seemed to be rushing to get done. The onboard entertainment system did not function in our seats (4K, 4J), but appeared to be fine for others.

The boarding process in MRU was chaotic but onboard service was good from MRU. This was a night flight so managed to get some sleep and be ready for landing in Perth in the morning.

"We were travelling as a family with two young children to Singapore after a wonderful holiday in Mauritius. Just as we were leaving our hotel for the airport I received a text message to inform me that the flight had been cancelled and we had been put on the KL flight five hours later (1am). The customer service we received following this was appalling and the airline put us in 4 separate seats around the plane (our children are 4 and 6!) Nobody could tell us why we now had to go to KL and wait 2 hours for a connecting flight back to Singapore. Will never fly with them again, which is unfortunate as Mauritius itself is a beautiful island and we were very much looking forward to returning.

"Here is what happened to us. It was my wife our 1,5 years old daughter and me flying from Norway to Mauritius through Paris. The Airfrance flight form Bergen to Paris was extremely pleasant. Staff members are friendly and they know how to entertain small kids on the aircraft.

The Mauritius airline on the other hand was extremely unprofessional. We ordered Kosher meal while paying for tickets and there weren’t any option to do it for our daughter, so that is why I was chosen just a regular kids meal for her.
Before we took off they showed us our sealed meals, however when the seat belt sign was off I was surprised that we didn’t have our food served. Instead they started to serve those who had vegetarian options. When I kindly asked about our food the lady said the following: different airlines have different rules and right now they serving kids and babies. I pointed on our daughter and she answered madly that it’s on the way and I am gonna have to wait as much as it needs. What a customer service. But ok, I didn’t wanna make a big deal out of it even though all other airlines serve it right away. On the top of that Mauritius airline showed us our food before the take off so the other airlines do as well to Jewish people. Which means that they suppose to follow the rules and they do sometimes I suppose.

Anyway, they served us our food which was the worst Jewish food I ever tried, but they did not served anything to our daughter. When I asked for the food to her - same lady replied that they don’t have kids kosher food, which is a stupid excuse to not to serve her the food at all. I said that I am aware of that, because that’s what I was personally choosing when I was ordering a tickets. She that brought us the food to our daughter, who was hungry and tired as it was midnight and she still didn’t eat anything from our extremely spicy fish and vegetables. This is completely unprofessional and disgusting.

Wait, its not over: when they were collecting the garbage - same lady refuse to take ours because she was taking those who had a tray. OUR boxes had trays(see pictures). At the same time we had one more Jewish who was siting on 18 f seat and the guy who collected a trash from the other side took it from her without any problem.
I though this is unfair and had to go take to someone who was in charge. She apologized and said that she believes me, but at the same time she has to hear other sides of the story. I had nothing else to say and haded to my seat.

Here’s what makes me mad the most: we ordered this trip in March and were very excited about it and that is how it starts...
Mauritius airline is not cheap: I paid $2700 for round trip for my wife, daughter and me in econom class! For example, last year I flew with Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong for only $2000 round trip. Both the service, food and seats were way better. In Mauritius airline you can not chose a movie or songs and start it from the beginning besides those 4 which is already playing.
The screen size of the TV is a little bit bigger than my Ipnone! Restrooms are dirty and it’s super hot on the plain. Plus the plain was made in 1980 or so, because they have a ash trashes all over the place: in the restrooms and in the each seat handle.

I will never ever fly with Mauritius airlines again and do not recommend to do that to anyone who respect themselves. Chose instead: KLM, AirFrance, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Korean or even Thai airlines, but avoid this one. How one person can ruin the entire Arline reputation?!

"we bought flights via SAA but then realised its a code share with Air Mauritius - it would have been great to be informed of this - so u know where to check in...

check in at OR Tambo was not the easiest.. Having travelled on many airlines for a number of years, it was the first time that we were asked to unpack stuff - the bag weight was 23.2kg.. I thought this to be ridiculous given the luggage allowance was 2 times 23 kg and there was 3 pax.
when i said i do not wish to unpack - what is the charge - they were not very accommodating and said not its too expensive.. who are u check in agent to judge if its too expensive or not...

anyways with that out of the way - the rest of of the trip was fine. the JHB to MRU journey - plane was not as comfortable. but the MRU to JHB - cabin was more spacious.

special diet
on booking i requested special meals.. but when i checked in, these were not listed on the website.. thankfully the food was on board though.. but needless to say there is clearly a communication breakdown somewhere as consistent info is not displayed.

"It all started on the 27th of June when my parents were due to depart from Cape Town they were delayed for 12 hours and hence they missed their first day and had to claim from travel insurance for the day that they lost it wasn't all bad though because they are arrived in at night instead of wasting a day sleeping when they arrived early in the morning so that is at least not so bad however I was stressing when my sister and her husband and my partner and I we left on the 4th of July and we thought that perhaps the same thing was due to happened but it didn't so lucky for us.

So my terrible review of the airline start yesterday the 8th of July we were due to depart at 16:15 we told at the check-in counter that the flight is delayed by 1 hour which happens you know it's it's not anybody's fault but it was the same reason it was the operational reason which means that the other the other aircraft did not arrive for the other destination in time. it starts with the fact that it's school holidays which is nobody's fault however there were about 500 kids, babies in fact that were due to fly on same flight not only were an hour delayed, but while we waiting to board again we were told that it was a further 20 minute delay, so we sat in amongst irritated tired kids.

So here we are sitting on a 5 1/2 hour flight with about 6 screaming babies they did not stop Then tire 5 and a half hours again nobody's fault because it does happen and we did have a bit of turbulence on a flight so their ears could have been quite sore.

My issue now starts with a airline staff I was told in Cape Town when I bought a bottle of vodka that as long as the the bag stay sealed that over be no problem for me to carry it back from Mauritius in my hand luggage because I was really scared that the bottle neck was going to break only to be told that I can't because no liquids more than Hundred Mills are allowed in hand luggage so that's was the first issue that I had is that the communication between airports and the duty-free is not consistent.

And then we were met with the most wonderful (read sarcasm here) airline staff on Air Mauritius they were the most rude and unhelpful staff I have ever come across. it took them over an hour to serve the first drink, then another hour to serve food and they didn't have enough of the one meal and both of the meals were spicy so if you have an issue like my mother does with spicy food, she didn't eat. I pushed the overhead button 7 Times nobody came to see why I pushed the button even though I was only asking for another drink because I was thirsty, they never came and then when she did come she said to me: did you push the button? I said yes I did, she promptly pushed the button off and walked away didn't even ask me why I had pushed the button.

And then it comes to the width of the aisles, when there's somebody standing waiting from the toilet or to the toilet, they just refused to Move while they were serving on the Trolley even though she was close enough to just move 2 rows out of the way, but just refused to do it and then we had the headset collection about 20 minutes before we were due to land it was ripped out of my hand, I'm not gonna lie they were extremely aggressive and extremely rude I would never in my life recommend this airline again.

I know that we don't have a lot of airline options from South Africa to Mauritius but I will have to be hard pressed and think long and hard before I give this any recommendation to any of my clients.

I've been working in travel industry for over 15 years and this is by far the worst experience and service I've had on an airline and the fact is they take no accountability for it because who cares, fly somebody else.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickyToms,VickyToms wrote a review Jul 2018,VickyToms,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",24 contributions,5 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r594256215-Air_Mauritius-World.html,The worst flights experience ever!!!!,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I recently flew to Mauritius for the first time and chose the national carrier even though they were not the cheapest option at the time of booking. I was really looking forward to this flight. The journey over I had seat 35G and was in the last third of the plane, an Airbus A340. I was alarmed at how little leg room I had. My knees touched the magazine holder of the seat in front and there was a metal box under that seat which cut the space for my feet by half. The box contains the electronics for the seat back entertainment system, which in my case did not work the entire flight for either films or music! The food was below average but you should not go hungry. The crew were nice and alcohol was served. This was one of the most uncomfortable long haul flights I have ever had (11h 50m).
The journey back I had 17G, also an Airbus A340. I was alarmed by how much space I actually had! I could almost stretch horizontal, plus there was no under seat box. The seat back screen was the smallest I have ever seen, smaller than my mobile phone. I could not watch any films at all but I did have music, eventually. The food was below average, the crew were nice and alcohol was served.

"We Travelled to Mauritius on 27th June 2018 from Mumbai. We were booked on economy class. Leg room was sufficient & in flight entertainment was also good.

Meal provided was nice. Cabin crew greeted everyone with big smile on their face.

Our return flight MK748 on 1st July 2018 to Mumbai was rescheduled by a day & airline took care of our 1 day extended stay at our hotel with all inclusive meal option. Me & my wife really appreciated their gesture.

"The addition of a new A350 Airbus to the Air Mauritius fleet makes this airline a delight to fly to and fro Johannesburg with. A four-hour flight passes by seamlessly with clean upholstery, new finishes such as smaller, more convenient food trays, footrests and a modern touchscreen entertainment system. Onboard wifi was fast and reliable which allows to either continue to work while in the air, or remain connected to your social media.

The air hostesses were very friendly and accommodating, however, service on board the flight was slightly slow and disorganised. The menu is traditional of any Air Mauritius flight, usually a choice between a tasty chicken curry or fish. The beverage service was very slow.

"NB: I am only writing this now. However, it is for flight taken during August 2017.
The in-flight entertainment was very poor. On the London to Mauritius journey: the movie was on a ""rolling tape"" so you could not rewind the movie- you just had to watch it whenever you pressed the play button. The screen was also very small.
Food was okay, but not great.
In between Supper and Breakfast there was no offer of any drinks or snacks. If you wanted a drink (no snacks was available) then you had to go the back to the area where the food/ drink was stored. It was a very long flight (11.5hrs) - surely the staff could have come around with drinks and snacks later in the flight as not everyone was asleep.
The breakfast was served 1.5hrs before landing - this time was not appropriate to feed the whole plane. By the time we got the meal, 15 minutes later it was time to clear up. Surely they could have started serving the breakfast earlier if time was a factor.
Staff - were not friendly, very tired and grumpy looking.
Overall, furniture of the plane looked nackered and in need of modernisation.
I was told not to stand or talk in the foyer between economy and 1st class as I was disturbing the 1st class passengers (despite whispering). I told the staff that I had also paid for my flight so I am entitled to stand and stretch my legs in the foyer and that we were whispering and taking into consideration of the other passengers.
Overall: a terrible flight and airline!!! Trust me the flights are not cheap!!!

"Booked with travel agent and upgraded at airport- Durban (R1800 each) - great flight with great service & great ground crew.

On return the upgrade was R2800 each - ground crew were not very helpful- couldn't explain difference and were just not friendly- take it or leave it attitude. Was not interested in sorting my booked special meals with the upgrade even which I had to forfiet on the upgrade- this was not the case in Durban. We did also check in early.
We were only 7 people in business class- no wonder why?

"We flew to and from Mauritius.On both legs the plane departed spot on time.. a big plus!On the leg to Mauritius we were given a refreshing hand towel which was a nice welcome. Pillows,blankets,head phones and a very informative magazine were all supplied at your seat. Wine,soft drinks and water plus a snack was then offered. I had requested vegetarian meals and my husband had the normal meals and both were better than other airlines we have flown.We were given little travel packs on both legs and they are the most useful we have ever been given.Even the little pouches are cute.The movie selection was great..indeed for once I spent several minutes trying to choose as there were several I wanted to see.
The negatives were the seats were too narrow and we are NOT big people and as there black boxes under the seats in front,very little leg room.Plus the entertainment screens on the way over were too small. On the return flight they were twice the size.The timing of the flight back from Mauritius to Perth was a red eye and as such is a horror time to fly but luckily it is 2 hours shorter than the flight to Mauritius which is at a great time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/a6/avatar077.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheryld16,cheryld16 wrote a review Jun 2018,cheryld16,"Perth, Australia",41 contributions,39 helpful votes,Perth - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r587726839-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Everything great but seats are too narrow,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Approximately 4 weeks before we were due to fly out from Mumbai to Mauritius (we had bought our tickets before), we got to know that our return flight to Bombay was cancelled. Makemytrip on which we had booked were of no help to us. We therefore contacted Air Mauritius in Mumbai. They offered to book us on the MRU-BOM flight a day before or after, but since our accommodations in Mauritius had been booked, we could not change the date. They therefore rerouted us and booked us from MRU-Delhi, and then on a connection from Delhi-BOM. I was travelling with my parents, both in their 70s, so I emailed Air Mauritius in Mauritius with a cc to the Bombay office, asking for an upgrade as this is the least they could do. After all, why should senior citizens have to travel an extra 6 hours with a change of airport for no fault of their own? Till date (it has been 2 months), there has been no reply from Air Mauritius. When I spoke to Air Mauritius at Bombay airport for an upgrade before sending the mail, they indicated that they were as it is doing me a favour by offering to put us on a direct flight on a different day! What about our hotel bookings? When I asked if they would pay for the cancellation so that we could fly on a different day, they said no. So basically, we are the ones losing out.We met someone who had also been rerouted and he was upgraded for his trouble, so why weren't we? At least my elderly parents should have been, if not me.

When we asked about duty free allowances etc, considering that we were switching from an International to a Domestic Terminal in Delhi, I got differing answers from the 2 different Air Mauritius Bombay offices. I finally had to look up the net and try to figure it out for myself. BTW, switching terminals was a nightmare in Delhi - don't ever do that if you can help it.

If Air Mauritius was not the only airline flying directly from Bombay to Mauritius, I would not fly it again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/2f/b8/0c/sallybombay.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyBombay,Sal wrote a review Jun 2018,Sal,"Mumbai, India",117 contributions,100 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r587138077-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Did not put the customer's needs first,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We chose Air Mauritius as they fly direct to Mauritius, over night and then its approx. 2 hours to Antananarivo. This was a mistake because the flight was so uncomfortable. We paid extra for extra leg room seats but this only slightly improved the quality of the flight. The staff were polite and pleasant but the service was poor and slow, the inflight entertainment was also poor as the technology is old fashioned and does not facilitate easy use. The flight is 11.5 hours and there was not enough water offered during the flight. On arrival in Madagascar, one of our bags was missing and it took the airline 5 days to reunite us with it...far too slow.
We flew business class on our return journey and this was not up to standard. Again the inflight entertainment did not work efficiently, the food was mediocre, instant coffee was served and again not enough water. The seats do not allow anyone over 5'8'' to stretch out properly.The cabin was cramped and stuffy. The flight attendant apologised by saying that its an old plane!

"This was my first international flight with an infant, and a long one at that (about 6 hours flying time) so I was a bit nervous about how I would pull it off. Reading up on Air Mauritius reviews made it worse. Almost every review was negative. I beg to differ. I wouldn't say it it was out of the world but was consistent with what one can expect especially with economy class. The ground staff were helpful and made sure we got the bassionette seats as we're travelling with a baby. The cabin crew were decent for most parts though I caught them giving an earful to some freakish co passengers. The food options have huge room for improvement.

Flew out economy... a poor economy seat, food was poor, entertainment was very temperamental and kept stopping to the point i just turned it off- not ideal for a 12 hour flight.

Due to this poor experience we returned home in business class. a lot better experience as a hole, food was great and entertainment was a bit less temperamental... still had to get it re set once.

Saying that, my actual seat headrest seemed broken and my lie flat mode on my chair did not work, not what i expected after paying business class fares. Other halfs chair was fine and working all well. Great legroom.

"02DEC2017. MRU/DEL MK744

I was transferred to Air Mauritius by Air Seychelles due Air Seychelles’s flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport @ 1915 2 hours before departure. Upon check-in, the supervisor approached me asking if I was willing to give up my seat if necessary, because of their flight was oversold. I said ‘Yes’ though I had not listened to what he offered me, such as providing accommodation, compensation..,,,,etc.

Around 2020, the supervisor came to me giving me back the same boarding pass, telling me that they did not need my assistance. He offered me to go to the lounge. Access yonlounge’ was written on the boarding pass.

How can I go to the lounge within such a short rushing hour! I dashed to the immigration immediately. There were long queues for immigration clearance. Though I asked the queue controller if I could use the special channel as I had less than one hour! She said, “Everyone is like you!” So, I said nothing more but lining up.

"First the booking process - speedy and flexible, allowed us to be grouped in the centre rows.
Then, the boarding process tends to emulate the scheme set up by Emirates, works but only partly because of the lack of discipline of ground crew and some passengers - rules unenforced defeat the very purpose of setting up rules.
The flight itself was pleasant, with a kids' kit issued to our two children and the attention the crew gave us was sufficient.

The outbound flight was on time but the airplane and entertainment were very basic. My phone screen was bigger than the in seat tv screen!

Food and drink were ok but nothing to shout about. They had run out of gin and tonic before they had served a third of the plane their first drink.

The inbound flight wasn't much better as we were delayed for 3 hours, finally boarding at 1am. The crew then wanted to serve hot meals and couldn't understand why we didn't want to eat. In flight was slightly improved, I could at least watch a film but still pretty basic on an 11.5 hour flight.

My self and wife have flown several times with Air Mauritius and in every instance we have found the flights to be very efficient.The staff are always smiling and are very friendly and helpfull.The food was of a good quality and in actual fact too much.The flight is actually quite short on just 4 hours.Leg room on the aircraft appears to be smaller than other flights although this was not an issue as there was ample time and space to stand up and stretch the legs.Only critisism is that the movies that are shown need to be upgraded as they are pretty old.Generally an efficient and comfortable way to fly if you want to go to Mauritius,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davesiebert669,davesiebert669 wrote a review May 2018,davesiebert669,"Hibberdene, South Africa",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Durban - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r580512711-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Smooth Flight,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"3 hrs before we were due to depart we received a text from Air Mauritius saying there’s a 10 hour delay. This resulted in us losing an evening & nights accommodation at our all inclusive holiday.
At Perth airport 2 female senior flight attendants were extremely rude, patronising and sarcastic, (other staff were polite and apologetic). It seems due to technical difficulties they changed the aircraft and the pilot in Perth was not qualified to fly this airplane. There were copies of a letter from Air Mauritius for passengers for insurance purposes, the letter was inaccurate which I pointed out to the 2 attendants they said cross it out and change it.......that’s professional & I’m sure the insurers would not accept that. In the departure lounge the Manager came to see us & felt he needed to explain the situation again. It stated some passengers had been notified the night before yet some had only received a text 3 hrs prior to the original departure time.
Once boarded due to the change of aircraft our seats we’d selected online were not in the same position as before, so instead of being near the back of the craft in a block of 3 we were in the middle 4seats.
It was quite obvious some passengers were given preferential treatment and many were moved around to other seating.
Other noteable issues were:
1) The food was the worst flight food we’ve ever had, neither of us ate hardly anything. This was the same for outbound and inbound flights. Evening meal was chicken......this was very poor quality chicken I would not have fed my dog! Cake was so dry it was hard to swallow, the tea is best described as warm sweet water. Breakfast was worse, a slab of pizza which could be described as dried bread laden with salt, again inedible.
2) The entertainment screen picture was very poor, it was dark & grainy. The touch screen was temperamental.
3) The headphones were of such low grade that when trying to watch anything on the entertainment screen you needed the volume extremely high & even then it was still inaudible.
4) Inability to stretch both legs out due to a large black box under the seat in front.
5) Bruised knees from the seating layout.
All in all this was the worst airline we have flown with and due to their manner, behaviour, inconsistency with each passenger alike, poor quality equipment and food we would not recommend them to anyone.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/8b/4f/58/steveandjulie-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandjulieh2018,Steveandjulie H wrote a review May 2018,Steveandjulie H,"Perth, Australia",26 contributions,14 helpful votes,Perth - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r579554112-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Worst Airline,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Considered carefully before submitting a review, but we had hands-down the worst airline experience ever with Air Mauritius. They boarded everyone onto the plane, let us sit on the runway for about 2 hours, then said the plane had mechanical issues. The flight was cancelled and the crew gave no definitive reason why. After first citing mechanical reasons, the ground crew then said the captain needed to rest. Who knows? All we know is, we sat for 2 hours on a hot plane that didn't go anywhere, no water was offered, no  to limited info was given. The whole plane had to be offloaded and the flight was cancelled. No compensation was provided. They offered a hotel, but that's useless if you live in the area. No  Air Mauritius reps were available to help and there was no info on rescheduling. Our name was put on a list of customers to be contacted and no one ever contacted us.   It ruined our entire vacation.  Sadly, the most unprofessional airline experience we've ever had.

And we were lucky that on both flights we didn't have any delays and everything was on time. On the flight home however it was a different story. Some rude staff with limited customer service skills.

The seats are very cramped for long haul and the entertainment system is appalling. I read before I went to take a tablet/kindle and I am so pleased I did. If you don't have one, make sure you have a great book (or 2) with you! I've read the new aircraft are much better but on most routes the older planes are still used.

"Very flight and service on an Airbus A350. Was able to upgrade to business class at MRU prior to the flight without problems for a 11.5 hour long haul flight to Paris. Worth the cost.  Lounge was quite good. Boarding procedures are all electronic via boarding pass on smartphone or scan on your own so this could improve-good tech but could use better defined lines.   Service on board was very good-- French food and drink, very good amenity kit. Great selections for on board entertainment system.  Seat had trouble reclining as far as it could go  which would have made the flight Excellent 5 stars if it did.  Overall very good experience and flight.

"The flight was severely delayed due to “operational reasons”. Just an ordinary flight, nothing special
Boarding completed 20 mins ahead of scheduled flight time, very efficient. Unfortunately, our departure was delayed due to technical inspection and a long queue of airplanes departing ahead of our flight.

The stewardess was very polite, good attitude & smiley. Snacks & drinks were served soon after the plane stabilizing on the air. Lunch was served around 3pm+. I have noticed the serving size shrinking over the years, and there was more rice than dishes. However, MUR food quality still has to improve. Drinks were constantly served. There were one incident when the plastic cups felt over my shoulder while stewardess were pushing the carts. Fortunately, there were empty cups, but they could have been more careful.

The legroom is rather small and seats were not as comfortable as Emirates, Thai Airways or Cathay, and I am only 5 ft 2. I have noticed the shrinkage of seats & legroom over the years for MUR flight. No entertainment system on my flight

Overall, this flight experience is consistent with MUR quality, but it could be been better, considering the points mentioned earlier, especially the seat width & legroom. I fully understand profitability is important, but over cutting on all these factors, will cost MUR customers' experience over a longer term. Though I am a loyal MUR supporter, I might switch to other airlines just for these reasons.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/91/f9/5e/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906wayne,906wayne wrote a review Apr 2018,906wayne,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",83 contributions,33 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Antananarivo,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r570911275-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Mauritius to Antananarivo,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Had a excellent trip with Air Mauritius. From Chennai to Mauritius they had this direct flight with best fare. Boarding was smooth and easy with Air India handling their operations at Chennai airport. Flight was on time and it was on the return leg of the flight that originated from Mauritius last night via Bangalore. Thus cleanliness was a bit low and is the only area that could have been improved. Everything else was impressive.

I was travelling economy with my wife and we could those couple seats (1 window, 1 aisle) towards the rear of those Airbus 340 aircraft. However for some reason I could not check-in online and had to do it at the Airport. Leg space and seat comfort was more than expected. Nice clean packed refreshing kit along with blanket, pillow and headset were provide. The interesting part was that they offer their in-flight magazine to be taken out as a personal memoir. In flight entertainment had sufficient varieties of movies, shows etc. at different languages which won't let you feel board. Lavatories were clean.

All cabin crew were very professional and polite. Food was quite good and was sufficient for a heavy breakfast. I skipped alcohol but tea/coffee etc were plenty.

Reach destination on time with a nice view of Maldives at all on the way.

We left Heathrow at 20.00hrs and arrived 1155hrs. The online check in was simple and easy. I had seat no 12B which was an aisle seat which I requested.

I arrived at Heathrow Airport, Terminal 4, 3 hours before departure and was the third passenger to checkin my luggages which were within my allowance of 23 KG.
The flight left 30 minutes late which is not bad. It could have been worst but made it in time in Mauritius.

I found the legroom was a bit tight and seat was not great. I have to accept it as I was flying economy. I found the cabin crew very friendly and helpful which are reassuring. The meals were served hot and not unpleasant. There were choices of menus - seafood or chicken. There was not restrictions on drinks. I had 2 Gins and Tonics and a small bottle of white wine with my meal. On the entertainment side there was the latest Blockbuster movies in several languages. I noticed a lot of passengers had iPads and watching their own programs.

I had my own books to read and relaxed on the flight. As on all long haul flights there are queues for toilets. The toilets were reasonably clean. It must be passengers were considerate to other fellow passengers.

On the whole it was a great flight. May be I was lucky. The cabin crew were hard working and very helpful.

I flew back to London on MK42 after 3 weeks. I flew on Airbus A343. We left at 22.00hrs and arrived 06.35hrs. Same thing. No trouble and had a pleasant flight home.

Yes, I would recommend Air Mauritius for its fares and services",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/f6/51/41/moses-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mosesp305,Moses P wrote a review Mar 2018,Moses P,"London, United Kingdom",847 contributions,153 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r566419651-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Great Flight and Services,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew on one of Air Mauritius' new aircraft and the seating and general environment of the aircraft is top notch.  Spacious, clean and neat.  The inflight entertainment is good too, a large selection to choose from.  Cabin crew uniforms are lovely and the crew were all friendly and helpful.  The only negative was the meal, strange combination of side salad consisting of 2 large chunks of chicken and potato and main meal consisting of  chicken and potatoes - not sure who chose this but it maybe needs a look at.  The taste wasn't bad - not great - but edible.

"From the moment we were standing in line for check-in, I got a feeling this was not a 4 Star airline - two of the passengers behind us were on standby as their flight the previous day had been canceled an hour before scheduled departure because the flight had not reached a 20% load factor. They were not given a confirmed seat on our flight or even a contact person... Just figure it out themselves.

Once on board it did not get any better. Other than the Purser (Joy) who truly was a delightful person, his crew seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties. I thought we were on our way to paradise, not a prison camp. A really unfriendly bunch with the skillset of a trainee.

Also. In Singapore you need to deplane for a one hour technical stop. Yes you must take all your belongings with you off the aircraft. On the plus side for vapers and smokers there is a smoking lounge right at the new check in gate.

Fly again? Only if I have to.

"I would strongly recommend anyone planning on going to mauritius to check what airline they are flying with and make sure its not this airline.  my husband and i booked our holiday through Virgin and this was the airline they use luckily for us they changed our direct flight out from this airline to a connecting flight with the much more superior airline Air France,  Unfortunately we had this airline on the way back.  This airline left late we were told due to cleaning issues.  The plane stank strongly of urine and was noticeably dirty,   The leg room is terrible, the worst i've ever had with an uncomfortable badly designed seat from the 80's so we didn't sleep once during the 12 hr flight.   This plane is so old it even has ashtrays in the armrests.   The inflight entertainment didn't work so there was nothing to distract from the smell and discomfort.  The staff were disinterested at best and rude at worst and only came round begrudgingly when they had to offer a food service.   The crew hide behind their curtains so no water for over 4 hours.   The overhead reading lights didn't work and the passenger in front who complained was told that the system was ""faulty"".   As well as urine all over the toilet floor things like the blankets offered also smelt bad.

"Where do i start.  The plane was dirty, cramped' late and straight out of the 1980's.  The flight crew seemed bored and were unattentive throughout.  We didn't see them for hours during the 12 hr flight and we were so dehydrated people were having to buzz them water as they were not coming around with anything,   If you asked them for anything they looked at you with contempt and they were very snappy with the passengers sat closest to me.   The food was ok no worse than most but everything seemed too much trouble for them.  I would also say its the most uncomfortable plane my husband and i had ever been on.  My husband's seat didn't recline properly and there was no leg room at all.  The chairs were shaped weirdly and had a funny lumpy part in the neck and as it was so uncomfortable my husband and i didn't not get any sleep during the whole flight which was over 12 hrs.   Also of note the plane was dirty and smelt bad (of urine) and there was rivers of urine on the toilet floor.  The overhead lights were not working and the air hostess said it had a fault on it (very reassuring) in flight entertainment was so outdated you could not watch a film on demand etc during the whole flight so very poor.  Another thing to add was there was metal cutlery which was great to eat with and maybe quite useful for any travelling terrorists on board.

"In a long trip to and from Asia including Reunion we experienced some amazing experience.
When our flight to Delhi was posponed (due to cyclone, not airline fault) having an incredibly tight connexion in Delhi, we informed AirMauritius at check-in. At arrival a young staff was waiting, he smartly brought us through all the steps even persuading custom, immigration, security and AirAsia letting us safely in front of boarding gate. By my (very long) experience, it wd have been impossible to catch our connection.
Again they managed it on Run-Mru-Rrg when under any logic connection wd have been too tight (it was their ticket anyway this time, so their responsibility, still.... ).
Finally when flying Rrg-Jnb-Gru on separate tickets, the lady of check-in who could not check us through at first, come to search us in departure lounge after consulting some boss. And made it all.
WOW what a customer service, never experienced before. CONGRATULATIONS.

"Starting from Sydney we arrived in Perth 5 hours later to be told that because of a cyclone in Mauritius we would not move on until 10 am next day so they took us to a hotel in Perth. Communication was poor, nobody sent us an email or text even though they asked for this info at airport. At 9 pm we asked hotel and they knew nothing but other passengers indicated we were to be picked up a 10 PM so we hurriedly repacked and were taken to airport. Here some 300 passengers were lined up with luggage. 3 inefficient Qantas ground staff were behind the counter, 2 1/2 later we moved to the aircraft waiting area only to sit another hour. We finally boarded just before 2 Am. We were assigned 2 seats right in front of a wall where bassinets usually hang. There was not enough room to stretch your legs in front and the seats had 14 cm hard aluminium boxes in between holding the fold out table. So we could not fold up the armrest in the slimmer than normal seats to get comfortable together. The staff were most unfriendly and any requests were met with a disinterested stare. We arrived in Mauritius just before 6 AM after a dreadful night with little sleep. This was supposed to be a day flight with arrival at 7PM.

"We thought BA was bad but this airline is worse. The aircraft are so old, seats uncomfortable (ashtrays still in them) and space limited. Cabin noise is loud and the staff unfriendly despite paying for exit seats. Worst is that we advised AM of the issues on arrival and they did nothing to help.

This was a horrible flight. outdated aircrafts with faulty monitors so you couldn't watch the movies. so hot you couldn't sleep. the Return flight was rescheduled after we had booked and paid with no explanation and offer of paying for an extra night at our resort. So we both had to take an extra day unpaid off work and pay for the extra night. Travel agents told us that the airline wont offer us any compensation ie reduced price on upgrades or anything like it and that it was a take it or leave it mentality not what you want to hear on Christmas Day... Customer service is awful don't come back to you  and very unhelpful and very argumentative. The hotel was fantastic but DON'T fly air mauritius go with anyone else!! the flight crew try very hard but the customer service at their head offices are terrible so as long as you don't have any problems it ok but if you have a problem ...you're on your own they really aren't interested and  don't care.

"Worst flight ever!
I've never have experienced a more uncomfortable seating even though this was a new airplane (Airbus 350). The space between the chair leg from the seat in from of me and the footrest was just enough to pass my feet and then I was stuck for 11 hours. If I instead had the footrest in an upright position to have more space it was pressuring my knees. Now you might think I'm a giant but I'm only 1m 80cm short.
The temperature in the cabin varied. At a time it became very warm which didn't improve the comfort. I notified a stewardess who just had a look at the display and said ""The temperature is OK"". You only had to take a walk in the aisle to see that it wasn't. At some rows it was good but just a few rows away it was unpleasantly warm. Fortunately a steward later noticed that and adjusted the heating.

I have been flying to and from the beautiful island of Mauritius for the past quarter of a century and there is no doubt that the new aircraft they have purchased has breathed new life into an airline that sometimes teetered on the brink with the old seats flattened so flat by a succession of big backsides that it was a real pain on an eleven and a half hour flight. Staff are always lovely and the food has gradually improved.

Excellent service and very smooth check in both ends. Although an older plane seats very comfortable and could lie flat on the night flight. Also massage option in seats.  Cabin staff very accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Business lounge at Heathrow nicer than the one in Mauritius but you could have anything you required. As it was a 12 hour direct flight would definitely choose business class. It was our Ruby Wedding anniversary so decided we deserved it!

"This review is for MK440 however I will also include experiences from MK441 9 days earlier.
My wife and I flew from Perth to Mauritius return for our annual holiday. As usual we booked and paid for business class seating.

Boarding at Perth was a bit of a mix-up with no real organisation to it. It was slightly better in Mauritius on the return trip.

First impressions of the A330/A340 business class cabin was that it looked very good and quite stylish. It looked like a nice place to be for a 7-8 hour flight. It really wasn't.

Service was decidedly average on both flights with a complete mix-up with my wife's meal. Simply not good enough at the price we paid for a premium flight experience.

A couple of things really made me angry:

Just before ""top of descent"" into Mauritius I had to use one of the two toilets situated at the front of the A340. In over 500 flights and 1.5 million kilometres of flying in the last 15 years I have never seen such a toilet in such a disgusting state. It was appalling.

On the return flight, which was overnight, I had the cabin crew lean over my wife to close my window blind not once but four times. I like to fly with the blind open and when I pay to sit in that window seat I certainly will have it open. I have never had this happen on any flight before and it was only when I got angry that they stopped trying to close it.

As the title says it was an average business class experience. Air Mauritius, in my opinion, is not one of the worlds greatest airlines.

Would I fly with them again? Well, I probably wouldn't be going to Mauritius again not that it isn't a beautiful and amazing country so the likelihood is low. If I were to travel between Perth and Mauritius I would probably look at other flight options.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrAustralasia,MrAustralasia wrote a review Jan 2018,MrAustralasia,"Perth, Australia",250 contributions,140 helpful votes,Perth - Mahebourg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r557427086-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Average Business Class Experience,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm sure this airline has newer models in its fleet but this wasn't one of them. The seats and leg room were the worst I have had the discomfort to endure & I have been on smaller planes and smaller airlines. The food was not worth your putting into your body to consume, refreshments were basic and the whole inflight entertainment system was tired & pointless. You had a limited choice of movies which all started at the same time so you had to quickly decide what you wanted to watch and then if you fancied something else it was just tough luck.

"I will put this onw trip advisor seeing as Air mauritius deleted it from their facebook page. So here it is:

In the 11 years that I have been visiting Mauritius, I can honestly say that your service is progressively getting much worse. MK440 to perth last night. Firstly get a call for parents with children to come to check in first. Go the check in point and everyone (the whole plane) is lining up. Asked two young guys who I think worked for the airline and they didnt seem to know what was going on (or didnt care. I couldnt really tell). Get on the flight and you get a greeting at the door, but as you walk down the aisles the staff are just chatting away to each other, no welcome or greeting to customers (trust me 11 years ago on my first trip, it was the exact opposite. Everyone greeted you! ). Then during the flight, my wife brought to my attention that the male host was displaying frustration that i had stacked up the trays after the meals on my table. Let me explain. Its midnight, i have two young children trying to comfortably sleep. The trays were stacked on one table so that they could lie down without potentially knocking their tables and spilling their food. I did not know that there was a protocol for tray stacking. So sorry for inconveniencing your flight ritual! You could have politely explained this to me after the first meal not expressed your frustration by madly cleaning my tray after the second. If you dont love your job mate, go do something else!
I just wish there was another airline to take for direct flights from Perth. If I can afford it maybe next time take a cheap flight to Malaysia and then catch an Emirates flight to Mauritius just to avoid your sloppy service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DreyfussPerth,DreyfussPerth wrote a review Jan 2018,DreyfussPerth,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r556456182-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Service Standards dropping,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Efficient flight. Food good and service was efficient but not enthusiastic. Crew do their duties but offer little above expectations.

A330 aircraft getting a little tired. In flight entertainment was adequate but not great.

Overall pretty good but new A350 aircraft much superior and hopefully they deploy it on this route soon.

From Brisbane they allow the very short connection from the Virgin flight but only on a Sunday (maybe because Perth airport is quiet on a Sunday). Connection time is only 50 mins so be quick but you can make it and the reward is arrival same day in Mauritius and no wasted overnight in Perth.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grahamh698,Graham H wrote a review Jan 2018,Graham H,"Brisbane, Australia",17 contributions,4 helpful votes,Perth - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r556092765-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Good flight ,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from Perth via Mauritius to London then London to Mauritius where were stayed for ten days and then back to Perth. The flights themselves were great- offering friendly and attentive service and a good level of comfort considering the planes are not the newest. It would have been better to have had interactive in-flight entertainment for all the legs, but the flight from Mauritius to London was on an older plane so only had the old-style entertainment system. This was not an issue as it was an overnight flight. However we were not impressed by the fact that we lost one bag en route to London and it took a week to re-locate it and no sooner had we collected it from the lost baggage office in Mauritius (9 days after leaving Perth!) we discovered that our other two bags were now also missing! These finally arrived at our hotel five days later!

The inconsistency of the level of service amazed me. Having flown from Durban to Mauritius with a fairly pleasant staff and a full passenger capacity we were whisked off to New Delhi in a rather larger but half empty plane. This served us well as the flight is longer but I did notice the distinct difference in the attitude of the staff towards their passengers. Also why does Air Mauritius impose a surcharge for exit seats?  DOES THAT MEAN SHOULD THERE BE AN EMERGENCY THERE WILL BE NO ONE TO OPERATE THE EXITS?

"The seats in Economy class are the smallest I have ever encountered in any airline. Yes it is only a 4 hour flight but it was extremely uncomfortable. I am tall so I tried to get some relief by sitting in the hostess's ""jump seat"" for 10 minutes 2 hours into the flight, after I saw that another man (obviously a Mauritian local) had done the same (he sat there for about half an hour). The flight steward approached me and asked very rudely ""Do you know where your seat is?"". I said ""Yes"" and before I could explain he told me to ""Get back to your seat!"" and pointed with his finger.

Get out of your aircraft first or brace for 90 minute queue in busy times. To be fair, I understand Air Mauritius are modernising their fleet, but I would avoid them until this is complete.

"The plane was delayed over 5 hours due to 'operational reasons'.  They notified me the day before and, as I live in Nairobi, I could make alternative plans but many travellers with connecting flights had to hang around the airport for 5 hours more than planned so there was general disgruntlement at the airport when we arrived.  The flight was full and the economy seats were terrible with surely the least amount of legroom legally possible (I haven't checked but it would be most surprising if Air Mauritius is not THE worst of any airline in this respect). VERY uncomfortable to sit for four hours with your knees wide apart and being jolted every time the person in front or behind adjusts his/her seating position. Entertainment was a drop down small screen three rows in front which showed a cartoon movie and then some 'just for laughs' type shorts.  We didn't bother with the headphones on either trip.  Business class looked like the worst business class in the world with old fashioned seats in a 3x3 set up that probably had about 3 inches more legroom than the economy seats.For the return flight, we were allocated extra legroom seats but the seats next to the window are extra thin and at a slant to the floor angle (apparently to make it easier for people to climb over in an emergency) so you can not possibly sit comfortably on them.  I actually had to request to give up my extra legroom seat before the plane took off so that I could occupy a 'normal' seat (there's a first!).  Food was quite good for a short-haul flight (hot) and attendants were fine.  We had one suitcase and one set of golf clubs each and had no additional baggage charges.  I don't care about the entertainment for a short haul flight but I do care about being able to sit reasonably comfortably (I am 6 ft tall so not exactly a giant) so I will avoid using this airline again if at all possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jambo2000,Jim G wrote a review Jan 2018,Jim G,Mombasa,49 contributions,20 helpful votes,Nairobi - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r552387074-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Terrible seats,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew London to Mauritius then to Perth then back to Mauritius and then on to London.
On the way out attendants seemed friendly but the flight was not full, however the design of the plane is awful, they have the life jackets in a black box taking up half your leg room so you can’t stretch out your legs in front of you. Why they don’t have them under the seat I’m not sure but it makes the flight very uncomfortable. The seats are hard and the leg room is tiny. The food was dry and not good and on all our other flights with them the flight attendants were very rude. The movies are dated and only have about 8 movies to watch that are current so after 4 flights we had watched them all.

"The aircraft was quite older. Air Mauritius tend use their newer aircraft for the European Routes as advertised on the in-flight entertainment screen.
No leg room! You are very cramped in your seat. At the start of the flight while we were still on the ground staff asked that I push my backpack further under the seat in front of me. However, due to unit of some sort be bolted to the floor I couldn't put the bag any further underneath. This also severely limited the ability to stretch your legs out. Even in the galley there was little room to stretch.
Cleanliness of the toilets was also an issue. Absolutely disgusting.
No USB ports or powerpoints, with the exception of the toilet.
In-flight entertainment left a lot to be desired. Screens were of a very low resolution and aren't fixed in place so would wobble with the movement of the aircraft. It was laughable that their 'New Release' film selection feature movies from 4-5 years ago. Luckily I had my personal laptop however without the ability to connect it to power this was only useful for a short time.
On a positive note the food was delicious and plentiful. You are also supplied with you're own blanket, cushion pillow and eye-mask.
Highly recommend paying extra to for emergency access row. People in these seats looked very comfortable. Not sure of pricing for these seats.

"We had a bit of a mixed review as we had different experiences from JHB-MAU and MAU-JHB.

On the initial journey the flight was full and the airhostess took half an hour to attend to a simple request for a blanket. Eventually I took a walk to the back of the plane and requested it directly. The plane was old and our on flight screens did not work. We asked the attendant to reboot it which was done (again 30mins later), but this did not solve the problem. Considering that it was a short 4 hour flight we were not really phased by this, but I'm sure passengers on longer flights would have an issue with this. We opted for Asian Vegetarian meal option as recommended by our travel agent and really enjoyed the meal.

On the return flight we were lucky to have a flight on one of the newer planes that had just been launched a week prior. The plane was much more cleaner and spacious. Flight attendants were more attentive, but then again this could be due to the fact that the flight was not full at all.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaneez2009,Kaneez2009 wrote a review Jan 2018,Kaneez2009,"Johannesburg, South Africa",270 contributions,29 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r550786710-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Basic Flight Service,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

the trip from Perth to Mauritius was excellent. Plane was of a newer vintage which would warrant a 3.5 star. On our way back it was the night flight very old air plane seats were creaking and impossible to sleep. terrible flight would not recommend it to anyone. i would give it a 2.5 star.

"Our 1st time in economy for years. Being only a 5 hour flight not perturbed by lack of inflight entertainment. The plane was full Seats reasonably comfortable & food pretty good. Sadly 4 or 5 fellow passengers where problematic, believing that it was their right to monopolize the cabin crew to the detriment of the others.

Having been recommended Air Mauritius by the travel agent we boarded the plane to find our seats the airplane was a 242 configuration so it was nice to be able to just have two of you on the aisle. The food was typical airline food what spoilt it for me was the entertainment system. It was the very old style of films played on a loop no direction of what film was on what channel or start and finish times. If you caught the beginning of a film you were lucky. This spoilt a 12 hour flight for me I managed to see one film right at the beginning will not fly with them again,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hmac5,Hmac5 wrote a review Dec 2017,Hmac5,"Herne Bay, United Kingdom",9 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r545073497-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Prepare not to be entertained ,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Initially I booked economy class on air Mauritius , as a treat I bid to upgrade us and was successful. I 've never heard of this before, you bid what you think is a fair price to upgrade and if you're lucky you get your seat.
What an experience. Check in quick and efficient. As we had upgraded we could use the private lounge, wow. Got on the plane bypassing all of the queues, turned left onto the aircraft. Greeted with Champagne in a glass or any drink you wanted. Lay flat seats with back massagers. The crew were so attentive. Food amazing served on proper crockery with proper knives and forks on table clothes. The only let down was the in flight entertainment. I can't recommend this company enough.

"This is a good basic service. But I wouldn't use it again in a hurry on a long haul flight for two reasons.
1) The movie system is antiquated. There are only half a dozen to choose from (I opted for Joy and Spiderman). But they all have set start times which means you might have to wait 90 minutes for the film to start again. First world problems but on a 12 hour flight it needs to be better than this.

The flight was only five hours - thank goodness!

"The flight operated BLR-MAA-MRU-BLR routine
Flight numbers MK747(onward)/746(return)

It has two classes, business and economy. Economy seat pitch is 31inch which OK kinda of spacing. Much better than air asia which has worlds worst seat pitch of 29inch. Business class has 62 inch.

Checkin desk was slightly slow. Wish the employees did faster job. Not sure if it was because of MK or Air India which had code share and handled operations at BLR/MAA.

Plane is slightly dated, but well maintained. No noises due to its age during flight. Flight attendants were very polite and strictly followed aviation rules. Especially flying out of india and inward people generally dont follow rules like mobile usage, putting the seat straight for take off landing, seat belt for infants and small kids. One of the attendants went a mile ahead and explained one of the parents on importance of seat belt even while on ground in car.

Food and drinks were served on time and I got whatever meal i chose while booking.
Foodwise there wasnt much option though. There was Kocher meals, Hindu (Probably Mauritian/Indian they meant) meals (both veg and nonveg).

Only negative I can say is inflight entertainment. I believe using a personal tab is thousand times better. it had very old screen, dull, devoid of any clarity. there was somewhat decent movie collection though.

Overall decent airliner to flight with all basic facilities available.
BTW there is an option to upgrade to business class after one books economy.

"Where to begin.....I being Mauritian, find myself ashamed to have to speak about what should be the jewel of our paradise. So I book a flight on this company to fly back to SA on the 23rd in the morning as I had a connecting flight in south africa in the afternoon on a different airline. While checking in online 12 hrs before departure I was surprised to 1notice that my departure time was moved by 1 hr.. alas if only i knew what i was getting into. So the next morning while getting ready to go to the airport, I was astounded to find my flight has been cancelled and thst no one from Air Mauritius had deemed to notify me. Several calls were made to their help line but they didnot even know tha a flight was cancelled. Time was running out and no one was here to help. Only after 2 hrs I was notified that my flight had been moved to 21.30 pm . This posed a huge incovenience as I was going to miss my connecting flight and i had to resume work. As by now i knew thst their help desk was useless, i proceeded to go to their office. Lol here came another surprise, I was informed that i had to wait for the supervisor as she is on lunch and cant be disturbed. When she did come, neither have I seen or met such a terrible lady for customer service. She was rude, didnot want to listen to me being a client. She offered no help and was everything opposite of Mauritian hospitality. At the end, I only managed to speak to their complaint manager and this guy should obtain a medal for his pr stunt. So i had to pay from my own pocket a new connecting flight ticket as air mauritius refused to accept their fault. Concerning the flight itself what a joke.. despite a 12 hrs delay, it still suffered from techical difficulties which made it got delayed for another 30 minutes  there were random alarms setting up at the back of the airline and the smell of kerosene was quite prominent where I was sitting. So my fellow travellers stay away from this airline...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nishchalc2017,Nishchal C wrote a review Nov 2017,Nishchal C,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Mahebourg - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r539380324-Air_Mauritius-World.html,1 recommendation....stay away from this airline,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First a caveat; this airline is due to update its fleet so I expect many aspects of this review will change significantly and for the better.

Contacting the airline to change our allocated seat was very straightforward with helpful and very polite,efficient internet support. Check-in was also smooth and staff very pleasant. Unfortunately there was a significant delay in the departure lounge where the staff either had no idea what was causing the delay or wouldn't tell us. Having had a bad first impression, I was relieved to find that, once on the plane, the cabin crew were delightful and helpful. The food on the flight was probably the best I have ever had in an economy cabin, much better than some reviews I have seen have suggested.

The plane itself was old and tired-looking with very uncomfortable seats and limited legroom for a 12 hour flight - especially when the passenger in front decides to recline their chair fully. Why do airlines use reclining seats in such cramped environments?
The entertainment system was very out-of-date with very small, poor-quality screens. The films play on a loop, so you cannot choose when to see a film or pause it.

On arrival at the other end our baggage arrived intact and together. Although the above looks very critical, as I said, with a fleet update planned, I'm sure it will improve greatly. I will happily fly with Air Mauritius again but would seriously look at upgrading my seat in future, purely because of the length of flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/185neily,185neily wrote a review Nov 2017,185neily,"Kent, United Kingdom",49 contributions,42 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r538647678-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Better than rating may suggest,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked return tickets from Sydney to Mauritius.

We flew virgin aust to Perth with a 1 hour 35 min transfer time, didn't need to transfer to domestic as virgin aust is in same terminal as international airport. Wasn't too concerned with the connection time as they wouldn't sell tickets otherwise.

Needn't have worried in any case, our flight was delayed due to pilot strike in MRU. Credit to the AM ground staff, they were waiting for connecting travellers in the terminal with hand signs, we were told of the delay and were provided with hotel transfer, hotel room and food vouchers.

We were meant to leave at 1.10pm but because of the delay we ended up leaving perth at 11.30pm that night, arrived mauritius 3.30am.

I don't recall much of the flight because I fell asleep 40 mins after boarding, the seats were crampy.

The flight on the way back was better, felt like we had more leg room, the flight was full so my partner had the full aisle seat to himself and I had the 2 seater. Had dinner and breakfast which was okay. The flight crew were friendly and professional.

The flight home was actually cruisy, no turbulence until just reaching Perth and even then it was little.

This was my second flight with Air Mauritius. Seems like the plane and service have aged since my last trip three years ago.  The twelve hour flight is a bit of a trial but at 6 ft 4 I paid for extra leg room again. The cost had increased a lot!  On the plane both my and my partners screens were broken and so no in flight entertainment.

"Since I have to go to mauritius this was the single nonstop flight from mumbai, India to Mauritius. I had no other choice but to fly with air mauritius. This is the worst international flight experience ever. They cancelled our flight from mauritius to mumbai because they had only 12 passengers to board in such a huge aircraft. We had our onward flight of indigo from mumbai to indore which was missed due to the cancellation of air mauritius flight. The airport staff sent us to a hotel which was awful as well.

"I recently flew from Melbourne to Mauritius with Air Mauritius.  The flight requires a transfer at Perth.  Be warned that the transfer time is very tight - I arrived at the boarding gate just 5 minutes before boarding commenced.  The flight from Melbourne was with Qantas, which lands at the domestic terminal at Perth airport.  You then need to catch a shuttle bus (these run every 20 mins) or taxi to the international terminal, which is about a 15min journey.  Luckily, with a bit of running, I just caught the shuttle bus and the lines through security were not long otherwise there was a chance I would have missed my flight.If I was to ever to do the same route again, I would book my own flight to Perth and just book the Perth - Mauritius leg with Air Mauritius to give myself more transfer time & a lot less stress!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/3a/af/f3/sara-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPSS_11,SPS wrote a review Oct 2017,SPS,"Melbourne, Australia",166 contributions,116 helpful votes,Melbourne - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r532722774-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Very tight transfer time for flight from Melbourne to Mauritius,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In July 2017 myself, my wife and 2 children aged 1 and 3 travelled to Mauritius. As a regular kestrel Flyer, I expected better treatment and better service. I am warning everyone to think twice especially if you have children. They are very child unfriendly. You have no rights when travelling via Air Mauritius. When we landed, one of our luggage was missing. This is despite the flight was the flight was delayed by more than one hour. That luggage contained all amenities for the children, their milk, nappies, food, clothes etc. We landed on a Sunday, and had to attend a wedding the same night. My wedding clothes and that of my wife were in that luggage.
I complained to the staff, they could not care less and said I was not entitled to anything and was sent away. No manager was available and later in turned out that the duty manager on the day was busy attending to the Prime Minister's wife in the State lounge and could not be bothered about paying passengers. I complained to their customer service, and again the service I received was poor. I wrote to the CEO MR Somas Appavoo, and their Chairman MR Sundoo. No response at all from them.
When we returned to the UK 2 weeks later, two Air Mauritius Staff were travelling. They were drunk, pissed, could barely walked. One of them had to even be assisted by the cabin crew to tie his seat belt to show how drunk he was. They were being given business class treatment when they were travelling in economy in front of all paying customers. Air Mauritius did not see anything wrong with that.
I spoke to the cabin crew about this, and they could not care less. The cabin crew even went to give my name and details to the staff travelling.
Air Mauritius took no actions, and they believed It was ok.
The CAA could not do anything because Air Mauritius is not signed up for mediation with any organisation. They do this purposefully.
What they offered me is 5000 travel points, 50 Euros, and to use their lounge when I travel next which is completely pathetic to what my family went through travelling with them. They insisted that I sign a declaration forfeiting all my consumer rights before I could get what they offered.
It is an Airline that do not care about its passengers, they only care about themselves, and the politicians.
I feel ashamed that this is my local airline.

"I was a bit scared after reading some of these reviews, the website did not appear as well organised as some other major airlines and the reviews gave me a few things to worry about. Then I got on board and wondered what on earth it is some people want from a flight! The seats were very comfortable, we slept very well on our night flight, they were very roomy and reclined very generously, the food and service from the cabin crew was great and just what we needed on a 12 hour flight. The only complaint I would make is about the entertainment system, for a 12 hour flight you need a good one. And even though it has decent variety, it is poor. It's not on demand like some other competitors *cough emirates* but just runs on a schedule so if you miss the start of something you want to watch thats it - and the next thing you want to watch may have already been on for 20 minutes by the time you watch the first programme, you get the idea.... This needs upgrading.

"I needed to go from Perth to Nairobi and return from Madagascar.  I had to book Madagascar to Mauritius separately with another airline, but the Air Mauritius fare for the rest of the itinerary was very competitive and the travel times shorter and more humane than the alternatives.The outbound daytime flight in an A330 was good, behind schedule due to headwinds but there's not a lot they can do about that.  I don't remember my seat being particularly uncomfortable so I guess it was OK.  Movie selection was OK but the screen was poor and my unit experienced a lot of interruptions.  I ordered vegetarian food and the first meal was pretty standard Qantas catering, the second was a sandwich which was very dry indeed. Overnight accommodation was provided in Mauritius.  Onward flight to Nairobi was in an A320 and was fine.Returning was not so good.  First of all, the only flight which would allow me to connect from Madagascar arrived at 11am, almost 12 hours before my flight to Perth.  Bonus, you might say, but not when there is nowhere to leave your checked luggage.  The agent in Madagascar had tried to check my bag all the way through, but got a ""computer says no"" situation.  Air Mauritius wouldn't let me check it in at Mauritius until evening, and there is no left luggage facility in the airport.  In fact if you're transiting, there is basically nothing for you in the airport.  I felt I had little choice but to hire a taxi for the day, which didn't come cheap.Still spent much longer than I wanted to at the airport, there is not much airside either, just a couple of cafes, a Subway and an overpriced spa which I definitely do not recommend.The overnight flight back to Perth was quite full, and I was lucky to be in a row of 4 seats with 2 empty.  But despite this I just could not get comfortable because there were very large equipment boxes under every seat, wherever I put my feet those damned boxes were in the way.  My equipment box wasn't even flush with the seat support, I was left with foot space just 10 inches/25cm wide.I guess it's the luck of the draw which aircraft you will get, but the risk of those boxes under the seat really put me off.  I read that Air Mauritius will soon be rolling out A350s, hopefully the boxes will be gone because their connections from Perth can be very convenient and I would like to try them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/68/36/69/bvc2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BVC2,BVC2 wrote a review Sep 2017,BVC2,"Perth, Australia",214 contributions,108 helpful votes,Perth - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r528046932-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Mixed experience,Date of travel: September 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

﻿"Flew round trip to Mauritius for our recent holiday. While I agree that the aircraft is quite elderly and the in-flight entertainment is limited, I didn't find the 31 inch seat pitch too challenging (and I'm 6ft or 180 cms), I found the in-flight food to be very good both ways (I'm vegetarian so had pre-ordered my meal but my wife, who isn't, found the food good too) and I found the staff to be both friendly and helpful.

"Was going to Australia transitting through Kuala Lampur. The plane was nearly full. Had 8 very noisy Bangladeshi passengers in the same seat section so couldnt rest.
Food was horrible, had 3 very tiny pieces of chicken floating in rice which was cooked in too much water. Food plate/ portion was half the standard amount. First time I flew and felt I was still hungry after a meal. The Air Hostesses come and serve tea which is extremely bitter as tea bags were oversoaked in hot water. The coffee is not drinkable. The wine was the worst tasteless wine ever served. So food is not value for money.
The top lockers for handluggages are overloaded so if you want to find an empty locker better enter the plane before the remaining passengers.

"First time with Air Mauritius flying to and from Mauritius.  Meals were okay but roll with evening meal and breakfast very stale.  Breakfast on flight back to Perth was only yoghurt, fruit salad, pastry thingy (and stale roll).  The service was good as we had plenty of opportunity to have top ups of our wine and drinks served to enjoy with our evening meal (another well known airline didn't serve wine until one hour after our meal!).  The planes weren't that new I feel as entertainment screens/control option was a little old and tired.

"This is the first time that we have flown with Air Mauritius and it will probably be the last. we had a fabulous holiday on Mauritius and will hopefully go back if we can find suitable flights.

the flight over felt very cramped and the food was appalling - both my wife and i commented that we have much better food on ryanair and easyjet. It was barely warm and the choice for four meals (there and back) was fish or chicken. Whereas if you look at the company's website it gives a very different picture on on board hospitality. The flight was due to leave at 5.00pm and all customers were queuing to board by 4.00pm. Everybody appeared to be on board by 445pm but for some reason we sat there cramped for another hour be fore we departed. No explanation was given.

"Having flown to Mauritius on previous holidays with Air Mauritius in economy seating and suffered in silence for numerous reasons I won't bore you with ,we had spoiled our selves on a visit to Australia by flying club with Emirates so decided we'd go Club with A/M for two reasons one it was a few hundred pounds cheaper each and it was a direct flight so a couple of hours saving not having to go via Dubai.
So starting at T4 we got through all the checking in and fast boarding into the Skyteam lounge which was Ok but nothing too extravagant plenty of choice with drinks but food choices not so good anyway better than in the main lounge.
We boarded very quickly through separate gate and took our seats. Glass of champagne quickly offered. Fast forward take off away we go.
Next nibbles, menus given orders taken, starter arrives all served on china plates. The roll was bullet hard not edible!! Moving on main course lamb cooked beautifully tasted like a salt pot had been emptied over it. Declined the cheese and biscuits , the wine was ok.
So this was dinner done and dusted within the hour of take off.

So take off was 17.30 and now about 19.00 time to try out the flat out seats not before looking at what films were on offer . Very disappointed total rubbish to put it mildly.not up to date films and poor selection!!
So lights out and get some kip. Well they're better as you'd expect than economy by the amount of room you have but not the same comfort as the Emirates seats.
Time to wake up breakfast.... Fruit, yoghurt , croissant , tough roll again , omelette or poached eggs. Clear up nearly time to land .

The flight was good , staff were fine very attentive.
Remains to be seen if the return flight is the same??

"I travelled with my family (4 adults) and 1 infant from Johannesburg to Bangalore via Mauritius. The experience was excellent, as the flight crew were friendly and attentive. They provided a care pack for the baby (formula, diaper) and adults (socks, toothbrush, sleep mask). I cant understand the poor reviews on the forum, as my experience was great. I would happily forego the much longer connection through Dubai for this route. Sure the in flight entertainment is old, but it is a short flight. Also the flights were less crowded, and for those travelling as a couple, the 2-4-2 seating means its much more comfortable rather than 3-4-3 on a bigger plane.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/e2/70/36/avram78.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avram78,Aveer R wrote a review Sep 2017,Aveer R,"Johannesburg, South Africa",29 contributions,18 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Bengaluru,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r522150586-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Great service and comfortable flight,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I reviewed this airline after our outward flight, and sadly it was just as bad on the way back. Frustratingly we had to pay for extra leg room seats to sit together, although we looked forward to the extra leg room! However within 10 minutes of takeoff a passenger sat in the cabin crew jump seat ahead of us for the duration of the flight removing the extra leg room we had. The crew didn't seem bothered, serving him his meals and drinks there and only asking him to return to his seat just before landing.

Meals average and entertainment system shocking.

Our 'going out' seats were by the window but near the engines so was a little noisy (can't be helped, planes need engines!!) I have long legs so always sit by the gangway so I can stretch out. Our seats provided us with blankets, a pillow and headphones and then the cabin crew gave out little pouches with toothbrush and paste, flight socks, ear plugs, eye mask and a pen. Each seat had a screen for you to watch movies/box sets/ games/music. Food was ok, I've had worse. When service had finished there was soft drinks set up at the back which you can help yourself to.

"My husband and I have travelled to Australia on different routes over the past 12 years and decided to fly to Perth via Mauritius on Air Mauritius. An excellent choice! The seats on the aircraft on the Johannesburg - Mauritius leg were comfortable with sufficient leg room; the cabin staff efficient and friendly and the meals served, good. This also applied to the Mauritius- Perth leg. On the way back from Perth via Mauritius to Cape Town, Air Mauritius gave us a free night stopover in a 4 star hotel. We greatly appreciated this as our Australian trip had originated in Melbourne via Perth to Mauritius and ending in Cape Town.
I should like to commend Air Mauritius for the the high quality of cleanliness aboard their aircrafts and the attentiveness of their cabin crews. The interior and exterior decorations of their aircrafts reflect the holiday atmosphere and mood of this tourist destination!

"A long flight made worse by dreadful cabin crew who could not break into one smile between them. Our flight was eight hours, we were offered one meal then thrown a pizza sub towards the end of the journey. At no time in between were we offered another beverage or snack. My TV screen was broken but I felt I would inconvenience them if I mentioned it such was their lack of friendliness and courtesy. The manners were dreadful, not once did we receive a 'please', 'thank you' or 'you are welcome'. It was like we were just an inconvenience.
On top of that there were two boys who spent the whole time charging up and down the aisles and no one from the crew came to speak to the parents. Again, the comfort of the passengers did not seem to concern them at all.

"We flew Business Class after having successfully put in a bid, which is a great idea that many airlines now offer. It allowed us to upgrade for $900 each, which was very fair for an 8.5 hour flight. This allowed us to use the QANTAS Business Lounge in Perth which was great. Once on board, the seat itself, was surprisingly difficult to get into a comfortable position when trying to recline. The choice of food was very limited, and in all honesty the grilled Chicken breast was dry and incredibly bland. The wine choice was also rather limited. I tried all 4 (Sparkling, white and 2 reds...all French) and I couldn't finish one glass, all were very insipid.....However, the positive is the crew we had.

"First time in economy for many years. The outward flight was marred by inconsiderate passengers continually leaping out of their seats to retrieve baggage from the overhead lockers blocking the alleyway for food / drink trolleys / and other passengers. These same people would engage the hostesses in prolonged & pointless discussions delaying matters further. The head sets where useless but of little consequence as the entertainment was dictated by the airline so one had no choice.
Despite being a night flight no masks or ear plugs provided.
Return flight excellent although head phones still didn't work. The bizarre aspect was that only six rows of three people where occupied IE all remaining rows had either one or two passengers giving them far more comfortable space. I have written to the airline on this point.

I HATE this airline - I don't hate may things but I HATE this airline.  Unfortunately owned by the Mauritian government they hold the monopoly on who flies directly into the island and given that outside Mauritius - the highest population of Mauritians is in Melbourne only they (Air Mauritius) can fly directly in and out. If they had some competition they would lift their game but there won't ever be competition.  The prices are ridiculous and just because they can - no one can challenge it.   The planes are old and not well kept.  The flight attendants are usually ok - no complaints there.  The irony of this all is that to their detriment Australian Mauritians choose to holiday elsewhere where it is more affordable.

"We travelled recently to Mauritius and the flight was just terrible. The staff were lovely and the food was ok, but the plane is so cramped that you are uncomfortable from the moment you take your seat. It really is time these planes are ungraded!!

Bearing in mind this is a long haul flight, lasting 12 hours, you'd expect slightly increased space to make it comfortable - well with air Mauritius this isn't the case. You are wedged into an uncomfortable seat with no room to move, in a cabin that is way too hot for comfort and you can't do anything about it for 12 hours.

The entertainment system is also a joke - it's an old style loop system, but the picture is so grainy it's hard to make out what it is showing at times, and the sound worked intermittently every few seconds. So you had no choice but to sit back, uncomfortable and wait for time to pass.

The saddest thing is that this really doesn't represent Mauritius. It is a paradise island and the flight taints that experience. We are loving our time here but already dreading the return flights. It is seriously likely to put us off coming back again, which is sad as this is such a beautiful place.

New planes, better leg room and a newer entertainment system would fix things, and please not only me but the heaps of reviewers saying the same things!

(If anything is different on the return flight I'll of course review again, but I have a feeling we are in for more of the same!)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/cf/df/38/danielgraham1989.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielgraham1989,danielgraham1989 wrote a review Aug 2017,danielgraham1989,"Chandler’s Ford, United Kingdom",179 contributions,79 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r512169413-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Service good but cramped cabin ruins experience ,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

After flying for 4 hours I had to go in search of some water as the temperature in the cabin was unbearable, I was greeted by a most unfriendly air hostess who told me in no uncertain terms that she was about to bring drinks round but I had to wait for her.

If you want to watch a film better ask the person in the front seat to keep the seat upward otherwise you see only a dark screen - terrible... better listen to music but the choice is limited.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E6074L,Eric L wrote a review Aug 2017,Eric L,Port Louis District,18 contributions,20 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Singapore,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r510404077-Air_Mauritius-World.html,MAU-SG,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I class myself as a well traveled young lady having flown with British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Monach, Emirates and easy jet and this is the WORST AIRLINE I have ever flown with. To start with, the plane was clearly very old quick didn't sit well with my frightened sister. I know this because the plane had ash trays. Next the scene was very tiny and lacked movie options. It was also unclear how to work and select the movies and don't even get me started on the difficulty of changing the language. On top of this the air conditioning was broken which resulted in the plane being very hot. My mother, who asked in advance for a dairy free meal, was given a yogurt and butter. For breakfast the options were fish or curry. If you do chose to fly with this airline I wish you luck and I suggest buying food in advance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353libbys,Libby S wrote a review Aug 2017,Libby S,,1 contribution,3 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r509905849-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Worst airline EVER!!,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was probably the worst long haul flight I have been on - 12 hours on what felt like an EasyJet/Jet2 type plane.
Negatives:
- Both our screens didn't work on the way out and the attendant didn't seem hugely bothered!
- Even if the TVs had worked, they looked like they were from the 90s with very fuzzy display and films on a loop rather than select when you want to start.
- Food was average - dinner and breakfast which was mediocre.
- Very limited leg room (I'm 5'9'' and if I had been any taller I would have barely been able to fit in the seat!)
- Drinks only offered a couple of times throughout the whole journey
- SO MUCH PLASTIC was used in the food and packs provided - every item individually wrapped in plastic which is totally unnecessary!
- Both flights boarded and left late with no reason given as to why.
Positives:
- Both flights were overnight so we could sleep for about 6 hours of the journey.
- Pillows and blankets provided
- Small pack including eyemask, earplugs, pen, toothbrush and toothpaste
Next time I would fly with BA or go via Dubai on a different airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodislife6543,Foodislife6543 wrote a review Aug 2017,Foodislife6543,"Ilkley, United Kingdom",12 contributions,8 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r509605493-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Average,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

the entertainment system is on a loop so if you miss the start you have to wait- although 2 english films shown was quite old too.

"So our flights were originally booked with Air Mauritius, we received notification of change of flights a week prior to departure that we would now be flying on a codeshare SAA flight.
Flight there was great, neat, clean, well serviced and attended airplane, everything was on time as scheduled and we actually really enjoyed the experience
This flight was on a Airbus A330, the problem comes with the flight back home

So the flight has been delayed, first by a few minutes, later by an hour and a half
The staff let us know they are offering clients a special upgrade fee of 7000 Rupees to Business class, i immediately agree, however only to be told because i booked with Air Mauritius i can not get the offer, ridiculousness as best i heard, so off to the Air Mauritius counter, only to be told this upgrade special can only be taken up with SAA, and Air Mauritius can upgrade us for 19000 Rupees per person, 7 against 19, wow, what a difference, oh well bad luck for us as Air Mauritius passengers.

This flight back is a joke, Airbus A320, no personal entertainment systems, the shared units in the cabin don't all work, food is disgusting, flight is packed like sardines in a can, understaffed and generally all round disgusting.

On my return i approach Air Mauritius to complain about this, they refer me to SAA as it was an SAA flight, but i booked Air Mauritius, i paid Air Mauritius, all this to no avail

I highly suggest you reconsider booking with Air Mauritius, rather look elsewhere, disgusting customer service with no recourse, although the really great power of ""word of mouth"" is something we hold dear, please do reconsider this airline.

In actual fact this is not the first time this has happened to family of our and friends, it would actually appear easier if you merely fly SAA directly, as most flights appear to be pushed onto SAA, and then you will be eligible for upgrades at reduced rates etc.,",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelRZA,Michael R wrote a review Aug 2017,Michael R,"Kempton Park, South Africa",47 contributions,6 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r508379477-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Poor Codeshare return flight with SAA (South Africa Airways),Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our return business class flight from Mauritius to Johannesburg was on a different aircraft type from the trip to Mauritius. Seating was not true business class but came with three seats where the middle seat left vacant. So although we still enjoyed some extra leg room, seats were narrower than anticipated and there were almost none of the seat adjustment options which were available on our previous flight. There was also a foot rest on the back of my seat which was constantly kicked during the 4 hour flight by the passenger seated behind which was quite uncomfortable. So serious brick bracks to Air Mauritius for that extremely inferior seating arrangement.

Apart from that the service was excellent with the meal completed in 50 minutes (Unlike the 3-4 hours on QANTAS) leaving plenty of time for sleep or relaxation. We were also served with drinks and a bowl of delicious cashews (Unlike the terrible dry and tasteless pretzels served by QANTAS).

Unfortunately we pay for comfortable travel in business class so inferior seating has resulted in my average rating for this flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/6a/cb/4d/dadndoc.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dadndoc,dadndoc wrote a review Jul 2017,dadndoc,"Adelaide, Australia",440 contributions,184 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Johannesburg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r504621182-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Return Business Flight with Air Mauritius,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"For anyone that has read my reviews you know I am pretty much always thrilled with my selections of hotels, flights and meals because I do a lot of research prior...well this time I totally screwed up just to have a long layover in London.

Not only were our knees jammed into the seat in front, low and behold the people behind us had their knees jammed in our backs! There was not even enough room to put the tables down so most people were eating in their laps.

The reason of picking up this airline for my travel was because it was the only non-stop flight for the days when i wanted to travel.
From Mumbai there is no other option ( Non stop) but to use Air Mauritius. I believe they have partnered with Air India. So if you book Air India, you may end up with Air Mauritius. Holiday goers may consider taking a day or 2 in Dubai and flying on Emirates Airline‎.

"On emirates and other companies, for boarding, family with children have Priority. Not on Air Mauritius. Staff were late to announce boarding. Then it was a rat race.
On purchasing the tickets I ordered child meal for my two kids. On the flight they were not aware. I asked for it to a male staff. He promised to look into it in 5 minutes. Half an hour later, he still did not showed up. I went to see another female staff, She was very rude, but did come after some time with a printout and told me that there was no child meal ordered. Anyway after five minutes she got me two non veg meals.
I would add here that on the second part of my flight on Jet airways, which I booked at the same time at Air Mauritius office at Cybercity, my kids were served their child meal before adult passengers. And I did not have to ask for it.
Later on the flight I asked a male staff to heat the feeder bottle for my kid. Here again, he asked me to give him 5 minutes that he could wash his hands. Fifteen minutes later I had to go and look for him.
On booking the tickets I asked for seats closed to toilets. I did get them. But when my kid asked to go faire pipi, the toilet was locked. I asked why, I was told bluntly that it was for first class and that I had to go over there. I tried to, but then they were serving food on both lane, and I was told rudely that I had to wait till they finished. Only when I said that my kid will have to do it on the floor that the staff accepted to unlock the toilet.
The tv screen is smaller than the one of my smartphone. And nothing interesting for the kids.
Overall I can say that staff was not very friendly. They looked tired, overwhelmed, and had the attitude of those civil servants that always make you feel that you are disturbing them.
So my advice would be : If you have kids better do not take this airline; If you have to, then have food at the airport itself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/b5/41/f1/ally-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/109allyk,Ally K wrote a review Jun 2017,Ally K,Flic En Flac,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r496806324-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Poor service,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Yes the plane was old but everything worked and the plane was clean with the cabin crew checking and cleaning the toilets every hour. The inflight food was typical fare and the drinks were plentiful, so what’s not to like about this airline, nothing. With direct flights to Mauritius from LHR and good internal connections that get you there at 8:00am so you can fully enjoy a full day at your resort its 10 out of 10 from me.

"Did an online check in....  got to the desk at Heathrow to stand and wait whilst some woman in front disappeared... rather than ask her friend to move aside so that she could deal with the queue the airline rep just sat there and ignored us all.  The rest of my group, who had not checked in online flew through at another desk.  Not a good start. Very disappointed that staff failed to appreciate the severity of the nut allergy one of our party has.  A man two seats away started to open a bag of nuts, and a chap near me was looking forward to enjoying some m & m's!!  It's difficult enough to live with this sort of problem, let alone run into ""jobs worth beauraucrats"" who would not even make a general announcement asking people politely to refrain from opening anything with nuts.  My brother is a very frequent flyer, his advice to me before departure was to accept every offer of a drink with the exception of alcohol to avoid dehydration problems. Apart from a drink with the two meals served... I was not offered any other beverages.... I actually went to the galley and asked for some water and was poured a very small amount into a beaker.  On the return flight the tv screen was so small it was very difficult for to see.  I wear varifoclas and had to sit with my head tipped at a very strange angle in order to focus.

"We were a party of 10 going to Mauritius for a wedding. our Agent Travel bag notified the airline that one of our party had a severe nut allergy. (life threatening) They at first refused to make an announcement on the outward flight but after a lot of pressure made an announcement 40 mins into the flight.
They contacted us in the resort regarding the return flight. They came to us proactively at check in for the return flight. The ground crew promised to make an announcement.
When we got on the plane the cabin crew were not aware. They said its up to the Captain Van Eeden. He refused. So now our party member has been tricked onto a plane with false assurances, is now trapped at 30,000 feet with no where to go. My wife walked the plane and spoke to every single traveller all of whom apart form one fool were very receptive and sympathetic. Some actually helped spread the word. The cabin crew just looked on like idiots. One cabin member Warren Ng was very sympathetic and apologised to my wife that she had to do this.
The rest of the crew showed no empathy or sympathy. The got our group member on the plane with false promises and put her in Jeopardy. None of our family will ever fly with this airline again.

"It’s about a 12 hour direct flight from London to Mauritius you know. That’s a long time to be airborne, bored stiff and twiddling your thumbs and everything else you can twiddle.
Thankfully though that wasn’t the case with my return flight with Air Mauritius though the fact I’d been upgraded to Business Class definitely solved any potential boredom and unrest issues.
We got off to a flying start, relaxing pre-flight in the Air Mauritius lounge providing various drinks and food as well as the ideal 'chill out' area.
As it happened, thanks to the super-comfortable seating, the excellent range of entertainment available and the first-class and ultra-friendly service being afforded at the front end of the aircraft, time quite literally flew by and as a result I arrived in London as fresh as a daisy having gratefully experienced several hours of sound sleep.
Drinks, soft and otherwise, were offered on a regular basis while the on-board meals were excellent too.

Well well,from that moment we were treated like Royalty,Food excellent,service excellent,seats and treatment 👍👍👍👍👍

"My husband and I have travelled to our favourite destination Mauritius a number of times. This was our first trip back since 2014 to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary at our favourite resort where we were married.
Over the years we have had no problem with the airline or flight. This year however, the plane being used appeared to be very old and tired, we had the same plane out to Mauritius and back. With the push to encourage Australian tourists to visit, it is sad that the plane is such a disappointment. We were fortunate, we only had to fly from Perth, people traveling from NSW and Victoria, had already flown 4 hours before they got to Perth.
The return journey was the most disappointing, the staff were not very helpful, whilst the plane was nowhere near full, they seemed to busy to be helpful.
Early in the flight one of the attendants was carrying a number of trays on top of each other, she ended up spilling the drinks on the seat in front and the tray, then took off. I watched off and on throughout the 6 hour flight and at no stage did she return to wipe the mess up, the tray was just tucked back in position.
On our trip out to Mauritius the entertainment did not work, I mentioned it to a staff member and it was rebooted, it still did not work, my husband and I gave up and shared his iPod.
On our return journey we ended up in the same seats, we had the same entertainment problem, this time we did not even approach the staff due to the above mentioned attitude.
It seems that there is a need to up graded these planes especially if the airline is looking at attracting more Australians.
We have seen over the years how the airport in Mauritius has grown into the stunning example that is now open, maybe Air Mauritius needs to look at some updates.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom-lee07,tom-lee07 wrote a review May 2017,tom-lee07,"Woodvale, Australia",35 contributions,14 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Perth,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r488381411-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Disappointed ,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Firstly we booked 6 months before the flight and our seats were 2 from the back. our seats were quite cramped and even though I am average height my knees were touching the back of the seat in front. Some of the crew looked as though they were'nt really interested serving the passengers at all.
We were sat in with a group of some 30 ,14 year old French students and had to suffer then all jumping around shouting, laughing loudly and blocking the aisle while their teachers totally ignored their behaviour. To add to the discomfort we had a young couple from the group in the seats directly across from us making out ( both were about 14 as well). We could handle that for half an hour but for 4 continuous hours under the blanket was a bit much and all totally uninhibited and ignored by the crew.

"Not many people know that one can upgrade at the airport just before you fly at a seriously reduced price, that's if there is seats available.

I had gone to check on my children and along the way was pushed aside by the same grumpy rude steward.  My children were unkindly treated by this grumpy man.  They told me after the flight that they were even too afraid to ask the steward for water. This is not alright!

2. Food was terrible. Overcooked and bland. Nearly burnt.
3. Cabin attendants were snobby and slow. Most passengers ended up collecting their own drinks and taking their trays to the kitchen because the attendants were so inefficient and careless about service.
4. I've never seen such unfriendly staff before. Definitely not a good reflection of the Mauritian people.
5. On arrival my bag was broken and they offered me only a third of the value of the bag. I had to take half a day of my holiday to mission to their offices in Port Louis to process the claim.

Yes, the flight/ seats were a little cramped on route to Mauritius (I'm 5'11', hubby 6'2'), but the staff were all very professional and polite. The entertainment was varied, but as a direct night flight, we didn't need to use it too much.

"The experience started off amazingly with the fantastic ground staff and then it all went down hill from there. My husband and I were travelling with our 2 year old toddler for the first time and decided to book business class... what a mistake. Firstly we had no help when trying to settle into our seats and the air hostess barely looked at us as we boarded. My daughter was not provided a meal on the flight and I had to ask for a goody bag just before we landed. Now let's talk about the seating... the seats are nice and big and recline all the way back however, just my luck my seat had to be taken apart (at 36000 feet - mind you) in order to be reset as it got stuck in the laying position. I asked the air hostess to assist and she politely told me to first eat my food... mmmm imagine how interesting it was eating my food while laying down... that brings me to my next ""pain"" the food. Oh my soul... I would be embarrassed to serve food that looked like that way... I had the fish and my husband had the chicken... I wouldn't even have given that to the beggar who comes to my door for food. It was terribly presented and tasted even worse - i picked at it and then just sent it back. It was disappointing to say the least... especially for business class! The whole experience left a really bad taste in my mouth so I decided to contact air mauritius and this was their response...

"April 1 2017 Please do not hesitate to fly with Air Mauritius. We recently flew direct from Heathrow to Mauritius and we had booked the exit seats through our travel agent . We were very pleased with the seats and no problem checking in and the flight departed exactly on time. The aircraft was an older one and the screen on the TV was faded but . The crew on board were very helpful and the food was good but not all offers of food  where available to us . The return journey departed on time again and the aircraft was the same again I had reservations about going with Air Mauritus after reading reviews on here and speaking to friends , but I decided to try them anyway it's s direct at a reasonable cost .

"It was the first time we travelled on airmauritius and it was it a lousy experience. We ordered for vegetarian food and we didn't get it on both our return flights. The crew was not at all apologetic and made silly excuses for their oversight. We were stuck in cyclone and the return flights were grounded and when we tried to contact the airlines it was almost impossible to get in contact with anyone. We were literally stuck in Mauritius with no news of our return flight.

To TOP it all up, when we eventually landed in Singapore my baggage was cracked so badly. Best part the bag was labelled as fragile. We reported to the dinata and the vendor came to pick up the damaged bag 2 days later. We were told that the bag will be replaced as it was so badly damaged. We waited for 2 months and still there was no reply from airmauritius. I had to repeated call them asking them about the bag.

What a terrible experience. If any of you guys are planning a holiday to Mauritius, never fly by Air Mauritius . Save yourself a flight full of trouble.

"We flew direct Heathrow to Mauritius which is very practical for us.  We wouldn't go Air Mauritius again because the plane is small and cramped.  The in-flight entertainment did not work on the way out.  The entertainment worked on the way back but was of a poor standard - very little choice.  The food was ok and the service was ok too, but the lack of space for us was just too uncomfortable.

"Transferred in Singapore, double checked with the Air Mauritius desk that my bag was on my flight. Confirmed!! Got to Mauritius, no bag. It's still in Singapore. Air Mauritius staff effectively blamed me for not clearing immigration, collecting my bag, and checking in again. Took about an hour to fill out the paperwork (as there were others waiting to do the same thing). I was offered 50 euros and told to come back in 3 days when their next scheduled flight would bring my bag. It cost me 80 euros for a taxi round trip to the airport, and another hour whilst the airline staff tried to pass me from one to the other. So, 3 days of my 10 day holiday ruined, it COST me 30 euros to collect my bag, and no hint of an apology or proper compensation from the airline.

Most of the people on the flight were honeymooners, but somehow the airline management decided to randomly allocate seats during check-in.

We were due to fly for a short 3 night break to Mauritius on a corporate trip. The Ait=r Mauritius flight was an hour late boarding due to problems with the food service. We then sat for 2 hours on what can only be described as a very cramped plane with extremely poor outdated entertainment system. It was then decided to cancel the flight until the following afternoon. The collection of our baggage took a further 2 hours. We made the decision that spending 12 hours in such a cramped space for a mere two nights away was not worth the pain and so sadly cancelled the all expenses paid trip away. Had this happened on a plane where the comfort of the passengers is a consideration rather than just profit we would have continued with the trip. We tried to book business class but was told it was full despite a friend in business class having 2 empty seats near her. Those people who opted not to take the flight at check-in when we were told it was overbooked should consider themselves the lucky ones as no doubt they would have been well compensated.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/a5/58/2a/teresa-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresac602,Teresa C wrote a review Apr 2017,Teresa C,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",9 contributions,5 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r472858916-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Not impressed,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The plane seemed a bit old and the seats and entertainment (TV, music etc) was below average also the seats whilst fully reclining are just not as comfortable as they should be in business class.

Not recommended and I will not use Air Mauritius again, I would advise using Emirates (unfortunately Virgin do not go to Mauritius) the other alternative is Air France which would still be better than this!

"To be clear, there were no major issues with the trip. But there was definitely nothing to make the experience anything other than rudimentary. The food was very bland, the entertainment system is very old and has a lousy selection of movies and a selection of games that could as well be non-existent.

My main issue with the flight was how uncomfortable it was. For some reason they have installed boxes under the seat to keep the lifejackets in. These boxes take up at least a third of the available leg space, which is not very generous to begin with. This makes it almost impossible to find a comfortable way to sit. I am not very tall, it must be a horror for really tall people.

"This is the second time flying on this airline and unfortunately it's the recommendation of both travel agents used...
The fact that one travels business class means that there are certain expectations which come with the purchase of this class ticket...
Notwithstanding the fact that these were both old airplanes to and fro with old fashioned business class seats...
- First and foremost is the check in process... upon arrival at the airport we found that economy class check in was open whilst business had nobody available to assist with the process;
- Second smack in your face is the fact that normally business class is priority pass or separate queuing when it's boarding time... this certainly does not occur with this airline in no shape or form from Cape Town International airport departure area;
- Food is mediocre and does not even reach economy class standards on other airlines long haul. The menu is beautiful, reads and sounds delicious but reality was bland tasting, tough pastries, wilted vegetable and the list continues;
- Staff are disdainful and it feels as if they are doing you a favour...
- Another case in point was the children from economy class and their parents kept on coming and playing right next to our seat... we have nothing against little babies or children however we did purchase our tickets for a certain reason and the attendants didn't address the issue at all;
- Upon arrival normally business class luggage arrives first, mine was the last to arrive off the conveyor system;
- Similar issues occurred upon the return trip with a major case in point being that the airline apparently had a policy that it's ok for other clients to spray a horrible tea tree oil substance continuously in the small enclosed space and couldn't ask the passengers in question to refrain from such an activity as the other passengers were all gagging... I personally had to lie flat down nauseous for virtually the entire flight as the smell was so pungent. My partner on the other hand had to walk through to the back of the plane to try and catch his breath.

Mauritius is a vacation destination and for us our holiday begins from the airport and not once we land on the other side... this is state of mind when one is traveling for sheer pleasure...

"My husband had a new passport which would not register at check in so we had to wait around for 1/2 an hour before our luggage being accepted.

The flight was fine, very smooth and cabin crew were very attentive- helps when you fly business class. I was a little put out when after paying full business class fares, passengers were being offered upgrades for $800 when checking in.
We all found the seats too short, particularly when they extended and the metal foot rest dug into our ankles.

"Mixed response because i had good and bad experience this trip; Flight delay in flight no MK747 ETD 5:25 am on 20th Sept 2016 which was cancelled and sent by MK747 at 1:30 am on 21st Sept 2016.

This resulted in lot of inconvenience to all. In fact we had a bitter taste of the way Air Mauritius handled the situation and left the passengers to fend for themselves.

The delay in flight situation was handled at Bangalore airport, it was poor, appalling and terrible.

Punctuality
Departure: Explained above and was put in a dingy hotel after 12 hours of haggling in the airport. Food or Water wasn't organised till such time we reached hotel.

Arrival: Flight was on time. Excellent customer service

Inflight entertainment: None of the channels were working; poor maintenance

I was very impressed with Air Mauritius service. The flight was on time and the service onboard was quite good. The hostess was very friendly. I got a window seat and the economy seat was quite comfortable.

"Hadn't travelled with Air Mauritius for 5 years and didn't have good memories as it was, but it's a direct flight so booked it. It didn't take very long onboard to remember why we didn't have good memories either.
Why do the air staff work there?? They couldn't be more unhelpful, unresponsive or dismissive of passengers if they tried. I don't say this lightly either as I have never written a review of an airline before. I absolutely love Mauritius and intend to visit more frequently in the future but Air Mauritius would truly be a last resort. In Mauritius whether you stay in a 5* hotel or 3* hotel the staff and service is always to be relied on as helpful and very good - which is why I am amazed and disappointed at how bad it is on their national airline. Seriously they should go to even the small 3* hotels in Mauritius and learn what good customer service is. Meals are literally dropped in front of you, drinks are half poured measures and I swear I have never heard air staff say please, thank you or excuse me. This is a 12 hour flight and this is our 5th return journey with them and they're so dismissive of passengers it was upsetting. Other than with meals we were offered 2 drinks for the whole flight and then the staff literally ran down the isle with a tray of warm juice and you had to be quick to take one. if you went to the cabin staff (who kept their curtains constantly closed) they begrudgingly gave you a small measure of drink- that is, if they weren't claiming to be busy or eating, which they did to both me an my husband!!! With meals we had 6 small drinks over the entire flight and felt quite ill from dehydration when we landed which did not help recovery of jetlag. I even joined the Kestrel club as I had intended to travel frequently but I will certainly not do it again. The food and alcohol are really good (if you can get it) The entertainment system didn't work for 2 hours and the staff weren't interested and suggested that we move into one of the many empty seats (no surprise there). We moved 3 times and so did many other unhappy passengers
If the job of serving people is too below you - resign and allow decent hardworking Mauritians the jobs. Seriously Air Mauritius put some secret flyers onboard and see how horrible it is",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/57/77/a4/bedfordshirejanet.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BedfordshireJanet,BedfordshireJanet wrote a review Feb 2017,BedfordshireJanet,Bedfordshire,65 contributions,43 helpful votes,London - Rodrigues Island,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r461896528-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Truly awful experiences!!!,Date of travel: January 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Air Mauritius is absolutely horrible. They have the worst customer service too and completely incompetent staff. They are also understaffed at the airports so will not be able to help you if anything goes wrong and you need to rebook. I would heavily advise against flying them.

I had the staff members at Heathrow lie to me, give me misleading information and last, but not least - scream at me in the terminal (completely unprovoked!). They had also incorrectly taken me off the second leg of my flight which lead to even more stress during my trouble. We filed a complaint with the airline, but it was completely ignored, despite the fact that the airline acknowledged that the behaviour of one of its staff members was out of line.

In addition to this absolutely terrible customer service which destroyed the start of our honey moon.

"This was undoubtedly the worst business class experience myself and my wife have ever had.

The business class seats are exactly the same size as economy class seats. The only difference being that they seat you in the aisle and window seats only and leave the middle seat open.

Generally airline food is pretty poor quality, but Air Mauritius took it to a completely new level. The warm food was pretty much inedible. The starter was supposed to be a duck pate, but resembled something of a boiled duck meat loaf that had been left out in the sun and completely dried out - if they made duck flavoured dog food I would imagine it would look and taste something like what we were served. Judging by the number of almost full trays being sent back by the rest of business class, it was evident that we were not the only passengers dissatisfied by the quality of food.

The air hostesses were also the most grumpiest pair of women in a customer service role that we have ever seem. I think the only time we ever got a smile out of them was when we were departing the plane.

The crew also closed all bar service 1 hour before we landed so you could not even get, so much as a bottle of water, which become a bit of an issue for us as we had an 18 month old toddler with us.

But the absolute cherry on the top was when I went to the toilet during that 1 hour bar service shut down only to find the air hostesses hiding behind the aisle curtain drinking whiskey and champagne. Surely this cannot be in line with airline policy after all what kind of a company allows thier employees to drink alcohol while on duty, let alone employees that are charged with customer safety.

They only reason I gave this review a 1 and not a 0 was because the tickets were relatively cheap - but cheap doesn't always translate into value for money.

It is actually quite a same because all of the problems I have mention above are relatively esdy fixes that could be resolved over night without having to increase costs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldlamont,Donald Lamont wrote a review Dec 2016,Donald Lamont,"Pinetown, South Africa",5 contributions,4 helpful votes,Durban - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r443930577-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Worst Business Class,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled by the same airline some 12 years ago, and it felt like de ja vou. Most airline by now have updated their air crafts, but Air Mauritius seem to stuck in 20th century.  I was allocated middle aile seat. Not much leg room. I had a night flight which meant lights were turned off most of the flight.  During the night I felt so thursty but there were no air hosteses around to ask for a drink of water.  I eventully had to wake passanger next to me to go in search for a glass of water.  when reached the air hostes's cabin, I noted the two hostesses were asleep. There was one who seemed to be awake, but when i asked for a drink, he just pointed in a direction where there was a tray with plastic glasses full of water.  He didn't speak just pointed at the tray!!  Wow what a service!! Perhaps my expectation of a service I paid for is slightly higher standard then what I received.The entertainment programmes, well what can I say, the booklet gives information about programmes does not coordinate with what is available, if the channel works!!.The back of the seat (in front of me) seem to have material not covering the seat, you can see the sponge material on either side of the seat. What with little leg room when the person in front reclines, you have not enough room to move about.Very disappointed with the service and airline.My return flight 4.5 hours delayed, to 2.15 am flight!! with no arrangement for me to stay after check out until my transfer I just had to sit with my luggage around the lobby of the hotel.

I can thoroughly recommend this airline as I have always had a good flight. The seats are comfortable and the facilities clean.

Unbelievably, the 2nd Air Mauritius plane was even worse. It was smaller, more cramped, the viewing screens were smaller than my phone and there was absolutely zero service.

We're it not for the sour-faced staff who brought out our below average meals and then collected it, you wouldn't know there were staff on board.

"We experienced this morning an emergency landing in Bangalore airport of Air Mauritus flight BLR-MRU MK 747 destination Mauritius via Chennai. We are safe and sound. But the situation was and is being horribly managed by the airline. Want to share the facts publicly and raise my voice. It's long. But at least I'll prevent other passengers about never flying this airline.

Boarding, take-off, all starts normally. The flight was coming from Mauricio, half full, on the way back to the paradise island departing from Bangalore with stopover in Chennai. All seems OK. Around 30 mins after departure, the air hostess announces that in 20 mins we will be landing in Bangalore. Alberto and me start laughing as we thought she had got confused. 'You meant Chennai not Bangalore' we point her out. But what's our surprise when she replies 'no, we actually got a technical problem and we are returning to Bangalore'. We looked at each other, surprised because there had not been any announcement from the pilot or the crew to the passengers about it. Not at all. Weird? Well yes I think so. Wrong? Totally.
We land back in Bangalore airport. Nicely and softly actually. We look through the window and what's our surprise when suddenly see 2 firefighter trucks waiting for us on the runaway. Ehhh...excuse me: did we just do an emergency landing without being warned about it? Looked like.
The plane stops in the middle of the runway, just like that. We stop moving and nothing happens. No announcements. Motors are turned off. We see airport emergency cars around us, airport staff taking pictures of the plane, and suddenly firefighters who start spraying foam on the left wing landing gear. Still no communication to the passengers apart from 'please remained seated with your seat belt fastened'. We are in the middle of the runway, with foam and smoke everywhere, and all we are told is 'please remained seated with your seat belt fastened'. Not very comforting.
At this point we conclude it's fair to say than yes, this was a freaking emergency landing. It was. We could not believe our eyes. We were not told about it. No passenger had any idea of it. Scary? A lot. Why? Well considering we took off at 5.30am in the morning, most passengers were sleeping, which means we were not ready at all to evacuate the plane in case there had been an emergency. We were not in alert mode, because there had been no announcement or communication from the crew.
I do acknowledge the fact that it's not adequate nor smart to scare the passengers in a situation like this, but it is important to make sure they are aware of the situation they are facing. And we were not. Not at all.
What if things would not have come up as expected in the landing? What if we had needed to evacuate the plane? As I said, we were simply not at all ready for this.
So here we are in the the middle of the runway, where we stay for another 25 mins, 25 long mins. We (or at least I) were scared and uninformed. And the question that was popping up in everyone's minds: why are we not being evacuated?
A towing tractor shows up. The pilot announces that we are going to be carried to the parking area. We reach after 20 mins, and we wait on our seats. We request an explanation. They ask us to wait and be patient. But it's not easy to be patient in a situation where firefighters just sprayed foam right below our butts (apologies).
We wait for another 20 mins, post which we are (finally) evacuated. Brought back to the terminal.
But things are not over. Information from the ground staff? ZERO. 'We dont have information about what happened. Please clear immigration, pick up your luggage and we'll call you'.
Dear Air Mauritius: we just had an emergency landing without prior annoucement, we have been almost an hour in the plane post that, and then thrown in the airport with no staff from your airline to officially communicate us what's going on, which are our rights and when we can expect this or another aircraft to take us to Mauritius. Next? We are sent to a hotel in the city center (not in the airport surroundings), no transportation arranged, no food vouchers given, with no ETD of our flight or information of a potential reallocation in a partner airline aircraft.
From my perspective, Air Mauritius has handled all the situation in a very bad way.

As of the time I am writing this, still NO OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE AIRLINE HAS BEEN RECEIVED SINCE WE LEFT THE AIRPORT 10 HOURS AGO.

UNACCEPTABLE.

On top of this, I have tweeted them for the whole day with no replies from their end.

Never ever flying them again and I hope everyone follows this advice.

Btw - heard than a similar situation happened a month back also here in Bangalore and they kept the passengers in the airplane for 5 hours, and then in the airport for 8 hours without ANY information.

"Booked via Trailfinders so do not know the true cost but have written to them saying that by calling Air Mauritius as one of their partners they are not helping their cause at all. It states lie flat beds with a 60% pitch - so how can it be flat! My wife and I both spent our 2 nights sliding down the beds Travelled business class and no toiletries, shades etc going but there was pack on the way back.
Asked want to drink before the meal but twice it came with the meal and thus no wine or liquor offered. After we had eaten suddenly the lights were turned off and we had to find our blankets ourselves and sort out the bed ourselves - no assistance from staff.

"We had booked our flights through an online travel agent however due to some flight changes and visa validity we had to change our flight date from Mauritius- Reunion to the 17th Oct instead of the 14th Oct. Because of this change, we tried to contact the online travel agent but the ticketing agents at the Mauritius Airport was very helpful in going out of their way to give us the best available flight time on the 17th Oct and at a reasonable cost for fees incurred on the flight changes.

"Having read mixed reviews I wasn't sure what we had let ourselves in for when we opted for Air Mauritius to avoid a 5 hour stop in Dubai, preferring a direct flight.  I needn't have worried.  The flights were relaxed, comfortable, ample leg room for my husband's long legs and we especially enjoyed the Eastern food on the way out.  I was hugely impressed with the customer service prior to our flight.  When booking with Virgin there wasn't an option (that I could see) to select seats, so I emailed Air Mauritius to ask how I could do this.  Not only did they try to call me, the also emailed me the seat numbers they had allocated.  On the return flight the seats were too close to the toilet for my liking (have experienced doors banging throughout overnight flights with another airline and didn't want a repeat) so I emailed to ask if they could be changed and within minutes I received another email with new seats.  On the flight the staff were just as helpful.  The men were more vibrant than some of the ladies, but as I wanted to sleep that wasn't an issue.  They did their job and provided me with what I needed.  A tray of drinks was available in the kitchen area for the middle of the night when they weren't doing the trolley runs.  Mauritius airport was new, spacious and airy. The only think that knocks off a mark is some of the upholstery was a bit tired).  I'd definitely use this airline again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VintageSuitcase16,VintageSuitcase16 wrote a review Oct 2016,VintageSuitcase16,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",186 contributions,50 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r429763833-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Enjoyable flights,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It was a night flight, so we started with dinner.The food was superb and then we all slept comfortably, waking up fresh the next morning in Singapore.

I ordered chicken for both of us and I even had my son's main course as he wasn't eating, it was so good. The inflight entertainment included the new movies and other programsI had not encountered as it was my first time flying with them. So lots to watch.

You may think you won't go back to Mauritius again but its such a great place and Air Mauritius a super airline. So if you fly, join their Kestrel frequent flyer program.

"One way to get to Europe--UK, Paris and others is to fly with Air Mauritius via Mauritius. I refuse to fly that far without a one or two night stop over on the way.
Whilst there may be only 2 or 3 flights out of Perth with AM, once you get to Mauritius, there are plenty of departures to London, Paris and others on a daily basis.
I always stay in the local town only 15 minutes from the airport and there are plenty of cheap places to stay in the town--just search online or take a taxi into town and take pot luck!
If you wish to stay longer, there are plenty of places to stay around the Island which may be a couple of hours away by local bus, coach or taxi.
I always contact AM directly at their local office in Perth where they have been most helpful.( Ask for Josie!) It is about 8 hrs Perth to Mauritius and 11 to Paris--depending on the wind!!!
When I last went with AM, the aircraft were not too luxurious but the food and service was very good and prices very competitive. Flying to Paris, you may be lucky enough to fly with Air France on the second leg going out and I have always found that they are brilliant!!
The locals in Mauritius are very friendly and I have always felt completely safe there. The food is excellent--mainly Creole.

We got to the airport far too early thinking we could book in straight away,unfortunately
check in only opened 4 hours prior to flying
But of course we were the first in the queue, although I had print our boarding cards they gave us new ones.
The flight was excellent ,left on time,no there wasn't a great deal of room but just about adequate. I did want to get extra leg room seats but found their web site a bit confusing
The staff were great the food was ok as was the drinks if i compared it to BA I would say about the same
My husband is gluten free and his meal was better on this flight than it has been on other airlines.

"We booked on Air Mauritius as it was the only direct flight from London we could find on our dates. This has to be the only time I have regretted being on a direct flight and in hind sight think that a stop over in Dubai using Emirates would have been a better option.

The Air Mauritius plane used on the LHR-MRU sector seems quite dated. The seating arrangement is very tight and particularly uncomfortable in economy. The entertainment screens are not of a high quality, and in my case the system had to be reset to get mine to work even. I have travelled on many airlines and the seating room here for some reason felt particularly small compared to others.

There are also no charging points on the seats as is standard these days. I guess this comes down again to the fleet being a bit dated. Unfortunately it's something one feels to be more of a necessity on a 12h flight especially when the on board entertainment screens are not of a high quality. We even asked the cabin crew to help us charge our phones somewhere else but they said it wasn't possible.

The service of the cabin crew for the most part wasn't very polite and felt quite impersonal. The tone and behaviour was rather unfriendly at times. All said and done we somehow managed to settle into our seats preparing for the long haul, and we were looking forward to the food (it was an overnight flight). Unfortunately the food was really bad. What was very strange was they only had two options chicken or fish - there was no choice for vegetarians. We were seated about half way through the second cabin, and even by the time they reached us the chicken was finished forcing us to take the fish. Whereas I understand sometimes you run out of one option quicker. But given where we were seated and how many passengers there were still left to serve after us it just sounds like very bad planning on the airlines' part. When I travel again on this airline I will be carrying my own food.

In conclusion the only reason I call it a 2/5 and not a 1/5 is that it's the only direct flight option I had and it saves us maybe 3hours of journey time. But if I were to do this trip again I wouldn't hesitate one minute to book a stop over flight on Emirates instead.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/91/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neofelis,Neofelis Nebulosa wrote a review Oct 2016,Neofelis Nebulosa,"London, United Kingdom",271 contributions,185 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r427463568-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Only good thing is DIRECT flight from LHR,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight was on time.
Other than that I was disappointed

Felt like I was flying Air India or even worse

I did not see even one staff member smiling.
The in flight entertainment did not work at my seat. Even after repeated requests they just kept saying they will revert. No courtesy to even admit that it was broken at the seat where I was seated.

Toilets were not clean. This flight comes from Mauritius to Bangalore - brief stop over before proceeding to Chennai and returns to Mauritius direct. So they end up not really cleaning the aircraft efficiently considering there are passengers on the flight at both Bangalore and Chennai stops.

Not much choice when flying to mauritius direct. Consider it a point A to Point B transport with no expectation of service.

"I traveled from Perth to Mauritius (and return) in late September/early October 2016.  The ""entertainment system"" was broken in mine and my family's seats both ways. Others seemed to have more luck. The movies would stop every 30 seconds and skip bits, occasionally a few frames of other movies would cut in.  The ""touch screen"" was incredibly slow to the point you weren't sure that your selection worked.  On the way back the ""flight map"" froze so I though we were going much slower than we really were and this made the boredom even worse. This was incredibly disappointing to my children and lead them to ask me every 15 minutes what was wrong with it. I think the plane was an A330. The food was okay but I'm not too fussy with that.  As for the comfort of the economy seats I was very disappointed.  I'm quite short (5'6"") but even my legs felt restricted and sleep was a challenge.  My 8 year old son also found it difficult to sleep and he was exhausted on the return leg. We had the option to fly Emirates but thought the faster travel time would make Air Mauritius a better option but I'm not confident we made the right choice.

"We set off from Birmingham international airport for the short hop across the channel to Paris Charles de Gaulle . We arrived in Paris on time and thought we would have a wonder around whilst waiting for our connecting flight to Mauritius. We had a four hour connection which I was aware of and had planned it that way.
It was fast approaching 16:20 which was the departure time for our onward flight. Eventually it came upon the screen that the flight had a short delay. Other than that there was no further information other than "" the pilot was feeling a little under the weather, so he's gone for a sleep "" . Then we were told there was a four hour delay and we should be setting off at approximately 20:20. After making further inquiries we were told it was an 8 hour delay and would not be setting off till gone midnight.
There was a lot of confusion and eventually we were told by another passenger that if we went up to the desk we would be given €16 each so we could get a meal and something to drink. After hunting around for somewhere we could get something we decided that we were not going to get much ( bottle of coke was €5 ) the food was terrible and so overpriced.
We boarded the plane at 00:20 for our 11 hr flight to Mauritius. The plane was cramped, I'm not the biggest person in the world but even I felt the lack of leg room, the seats were so uncomfortable. I put two pillows under me and still got a numb bum. The food was average at best and the beer was warm. It was at this point I wish we'd booked with Emirates ( so much better).
After returning from our holiday I've been in touch with the airline to complain and seek compensation for the delayed flight. So far it's been escalated twice to higher level management , the last time was to the CEO of air Mauritius after being offered 50% off any flight with their airline within the next 12 months . Being as we've already booked for Mexico next year and they don't fly there , this offer was declined and I'm still waiting to hear back from the CEO . Would not fly with Air Mauritius if they offered me free flights for life....waste of time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steff4t7,steff4t7 wrote a review Sep 2016,steff4t7,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",4 contributions,3 helpful votes,Paris - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r423178428-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Will not fly with them again,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The flight was only slightly late leaving and arriving. The food was up to my low expectations but the killer was the fact that I could only just get both knees behind the seat in front by sitting bolt upright - even then they were touching the seat in front. Given that it was a 12 hour night flight the chances (and realisation) of getting much sleep were slim. I'm not unusually tall (6') and there were people taller than me who would have fared worse.

"We were originally booked to travel economy to Mauritius. However, due to the 12 hour flight, we decided to upgrade to business class.
This was a pretty good experience overall, but there are a couple of areas that need some improvement to put Air Mauritius at a higher level on the top 100 airlines.
The food was average. The main courses were fine, but I found some of the starters and desserts a little tasteless.
The seat/bed is not a flat one. The sleeping angle I thought was uncomfortable.
I believe the entertainment system is to be upgraded in 2017, not before time, poor picture and sound quality in today's digital age.

"We flew return on this airline - economy class. There is an average amount of space, average seats bearable for only a 5 hour flight. Flying to Mauritius there was a couple in front of us they had never flown before. The staff were rude and unhelpful to them, we showed them how everything works. But return was with different airline staff who were on the plane and they were very friendly and helpful. It's always a gamble when you do fly you never know what kind of airline staff will be assisting you. My advise is to always expect the least, be calm and grin and bear whatever you have to put up with. The airline food wasn't that bad and movie choices were updated so there was enough to keep us busy.

"Unfortunately we have no choice but to fly Air Mauritius as this is the only direct flight from Cape Town. We have flown business class twice before but as this is no REAL business class with lie flat seats etc.,(merely a little extra leg room and spare seat between us) we did not think it worth the extra money so we decided on economy which we will NEVER do again.This is an almost 6 hour flight so we cannot understand why they don't use a bigger plane that can offer genuine business class seats. The crew are not very friendly.As soon as lunch and refreshments have been served we were requested to close our windows at 3pm in the afternoon???This would not have been so bad had they offered proper inflight entertainment and at least a few more refreshments along the way.The crew was not seen again until 2 hours before landing when we were offered a sandwich and refreshments. We upgraded to business on the return flight to have just a little extra comfort but sadly the crew were just as disinterested in the passengers which we had noticed on previous flights. They remained behind the closed curtain immediately breakfast was served and we all had to request our drinks etc. individually.I believe Johannesburg and Cape Town to Mauritius are really popular routes and I cannot understand why they don't make use of more comfortable planes with a little more legroom, entertainment and better service from the crew.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709alexandram,Alexandra M wrote a review Sep 2016,Alexandra M,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",38 contributions,49 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mahebourg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r420162590-Air_Mauritius-World.html,"CRAMPED, BAD SERVICE AND POOR ENTERTAINMENT",Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My 81 year old mum fell on the eve of our return and had to be hospitalized in ICU for a week before returning on this flight on a stretcher accompanied by an aviation doctor. Despite providing the airline with a doctor's report, the airline insisted that she pay a penalty. 3 of us stayed back to be with her and the airline also insisted that we pay a penalty which our travel  agent in South Africa managed to waive. The Air Mauritius staff at their office in Cyber Tower were absolutely slow and unhelpful and they also charged more because of a service charge that they added for the worst service imaginable. The cost of the doctor's ticket on Economy cost more than a business class ticket on the same flight and was the equivalent of the cost of our return flight and a 7-day stay at a 5 star resort. the reason cited was that this was due to a late booking and this was the last available ticket. Despite the explanation that this was something that was unforeseen the airline would not budge and grant a concession, causing us to purchase a business class ticket since it was cheaper. When we boarded the plane we discovered there were 8 or more vacant seats in the Economy class.

"I flew regularly with Air Mauritius as a child and have fond memories of an efficient friendly service and so was very disappointed with my recent flight with them.

The aircraft are tired and in many places broken. I had to try three different seats in order to find one with working entertainment system and therefore ended up sitting away from my new wife for much of the flight.

The economy seats are terrible and have less leg room than many budget charter airlines.

The staff were less than attentive and seemed more interested in flirting with other Mauritians on the flight than dealing with any other customers. This was bordering on racism and they proceeded to assist the gentleman in front to get drunk to get steaming drunk by regularly supplying him with whiskey. My wife was woken during the night by water pouring on to her legs and backs through the the seat I front. Fortunately it turned out to be a large bottle of water that the drunk man had toppled rather than her first thought that he had wet himself (he was that drunk).

A polite request regarding a fish allergy was treated with rudeness and contempt and the attitude toward a serious allergy was blasé at best.

I will never fly with them again. My reason for flying with them was the opportunity to avoid a layover, something I will willingly accept in the future.

The booking staff and check in staff however, were well trained and extremely pleasant.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mackers-a,Fred A wrote a review Sep 2016,Fred A,"Truro, United Kingdom",3 contributions,4 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r419034504-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Worst flight of our lives from a dissapointing tired airline.,Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We recently booked a quick trip to Mauritius and flew directly more Cape Town. The flight boarded on time and arrived as per schedule. The flight attendants were exceptionally friendly and efficient and the food was average to good. Seating remains a challenge in economy but was no worse than many other airlines but the seats were at least comfortable notwithstanding the seat pitch. Prefer to load entertainment on your personal devices as the overhead screens and selection is below average and very difficult to hear.
Definitely my preferred selection rather than flying via OR Tambo on SAA.
The flight schedule could be better as you really only get to your Mauritius hotel around midnight and on your return day have to leave at 05:30 in the morning.

"I was on the plane for 15 hours (non stop). Where do I even start? The flight attendants are rude, patronizing and unhelpful. The food was awful. They don't sell things like crisps or any other snacks on the flight so you are therefore forced to eat the awful food provided for you...On the whole of the 15 hour flight we were fed three times, ""that's great"", you may think... But no, you would be very wrong! The snack they give you (which constitutes the third time I was fed) was disgusting, I couldn't physically stomach it... Which I didn't necessarily expect to be able to as not everyone likes everything but I thought that they would at least have some alternatives or I may be able to purchase other snacks but no! So I starved for most of the journey back.

Slice of Pizza was served just before arrival. There was maybe a slightly too long break between the two. I ate lunch and I was ready for something to eat earlier than when the pizza was served.

"Appalling from check-in to stepping off the plane.

Firstly a member of my family who paid to travel with us was unable to do so due to being hospitalised. I was shocked to be informed that her reservation would be cancelled and no refund would be given. No reason or explanation was given and her seat was given away before we had even been checked in.

My 3 year old daughter was seated at the opposite end of the plane to me. I asked countless times to be seated next to her but it fell on deaf ears. Airline staff showed no compassion or willingness to help me out whatsoever. In the end I had to refuse to board the plane unless they seated me next to her. It is absurd Air Mauritius deem it acceptable to keep a 3 year old toddler away from both parents and sit her beside strangers on an 11 hour flight. Who would have taken her to the toilet, or comforted her if she got upset/scared? Madness!

It goes on...

I was unable to pre-book seats for inbound or outbound flights as the website would not allow me too.

My sister and brother had no entertainment during the outbound flight because the screens were broken. Air attendants were informed however they did nothing.

My husbands screen had dried sick down it.

My daughter did not received a child’s meal or toy tin on either flight as I saw other children did.

"We did a to and fro journey - left Mumbai on 3rd morning and return from Mauritius was on 9th night. We were pleasantly surprised by the airlines after reading so many reviews online.

I would rate the overall experience 6.5-7 out of 10. We were given seats in either A or B or G or H hence we avoided the four seater of C,D,E,F. We had pre-booked our meals and it was nice (if you are vegetarian pls pre-book your meal).

My 2.5 year old received different gifts on both sides of the journey and was super excited and happy.

The info system was nice and I ended up seeing a classic. Their choice of collection is decent. However my fellow travellers on the return journey complained that their info system was not working despite informing the staff.

The airlines staff were very courteous and did attend to all our needs.

I am 6 feet and 1 inch tall and the leg space was a bit cramped hence was sitting on the aisle seat and had emptied all the contents of the seat pocket to ensure adequate leg space.

Overall a really nice experience, the only tip is to pre block the seats and meals atleast 48 hours in advance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/a6/avatar077.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prateekj,prateekj wrote a review Aug 2016,prateekj,mumbai,54 contributions,53 helpful votes,Mumbai - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r404735506-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Suprised,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew with them 9 years ago on the same route and seems like nothing has changed - besides a new paint job and updated cabin. Seats are hard and cramped, leg room is a comparable to a low-cost carrier. They are trying hard on the service side of things but there is room for improvement.

Being the only SIN-MRU direct flight, there are no much alternatives to choose from besides going via the Middle East. But timing and cost will be more.

Nevertheless, in line with the new air corridor agreement between Africa and Asia, i heard AirAsia will be launching KUL-MRU flights soon.

"I cannot fault the service we have had and the experience is always great.  I suffer from a physical disability and the airlines goes out of its way to assist me with the use of a wheelchair and help to get on and off the plane, taking care of us in the airport, without charging anything.  My husband also has diabetes and they provide extra meals and services for his condition, wonderful.  The air hostesses and hosts go above and beyond the call of duty.  Thank you Air Mauritius for all your assistance throughout the process of travelling from the phone calls at home to make sure everything was in order for the flight.

"Boarding was dead slow.
Cabin crew did not respond to my good morning' - strange: just some years ago, their tagline was ""smiles ahead''...
Leg room was the bare minimum - and I'm not that tall!
Seats were cramped.
Breakfast was cold, with extremes in saltiness and sweetness. Not speaking about the quantity - probably calculated for a child.
In-flight entertainment was non-existent - my LCD's screen were not operational, and the few that I saw working either had bad colour settings or the image quality was so bad they were ignored completely.
The lunch was as drab and mortifying as the breakfast, quantities were also minimal.
Request for additional drinks were ignored, so I got up form my seat and went down the aisle to use my best negotiating skills for obtaining a more decent quantity of rehydration - tomato juice in may case.
Cabin crew was clearly discriminating against Mauritians - you just need to compare their demeanour when serving a white-skinned foreigner against serving another. I hope someone makes a youtube video of it someday...
Landing was brutal, to say the least. And strangely, this has been the case during the return trip as well.
Verdict: avoid, even if it goes against my own Mauritian interests.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/67/avatar045.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104akashg,Akash G wrote a review Aug 2016,Akash G,Port Louis,73 contributions,68 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r401089217-Air_Mauritius-World.html,"Boring, not clean, uneven staff.",Date of travel: March 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Having extensively flown in economy class throughout the world, I would have to say this airline has the most uncomfortable squashed seats in economy. The price was what we could afford, but really, if asked whether I would do it again, whether it was worth it, I would have to say no. Often, one forgets being uncomfortable to some degree. This was extraordinary. I am not a big person, but found the seats extremely small. To top it off, we were allocated seats in the middle of a group of school children. Really? Not behind, not in front, but smack bang in the middle. I just couldn't believe that the airline would do that. Did no one use their brain and think how incredibly uncomfortable that would be for anyone..to be in the middle of a group of thirty or forty sixteen year olds on a night flight?  That was not just bad luck, that was cruel. Anyway, I would never recommend this airline, even if you were allocated seats in a sensible way because the seats are significantly closer together than any other airline. It is plain torture. Oh and I seem to remember the staff been extremely officious.

"Air Mauritius is my mostly used airline, because I live on the island. I have used it several dozen times. The key strength of the airline is that it has direct flights to major cities (Paris, London, Delhi, Johannesburg, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, and others) so you can expect the quickest flight, compared if you use alternate airlines, where you may end up with 30+ hours flights, including layovers. It also eliminates issues such as missed connection.

The ground & crew service, and the cabin amenities are generally what you expect from other good airlines (such as South African Airways or American Airlines). However is does not have the ""luxury touch"" (such as Emirates).

The airline has a very good safety record, the pilots are a combination of locals and foreigners, and the cabin crew are always Mauritians (expect Mauritian hospitality!)

High points: 1)One evening, i called their hotline to re-book my long term ticket for the next morning, it was done fast, with a fee of about 30 USD. Shap shap!
2) In all my travels, it has never departed late, neither I had lost luggage.

Low points: 1)Meals are less delicious compared to other airlines. 2) Long haul flights are almost always fully booked, it can feel cramped. 3) Onboard entertainment system is aging technology, time for a change. 4) Some flight attendants are very nice to foreigners but are rude to fellow Mauritians, hope management can curb their attitude.

It all goes down to EITHER get to your destination quick and have fun there OR take your time to reach your destination in a more enjoyable way.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zu_Explorer,Zu_Explorer wrote a review Aug 2016,Zu_Explorer,Mauritius,62 contributions,75 helpful votes,Paris - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r400924470-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Fastest flights to cities it deserves,Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

You do not often see such a combination of incompetence and messed up minds as you get on Mauritius Airport. There is no upper limit to the incompetence.

"Traveled on Air Mauritius MK 851 from Mauritius to Johannesburg - a short 4 hour flight.
Service was not too bad, neither special. The seats on the flight in the economy class is far below standard of the seats in the economy class in other airlines I flew, namely South African Airlines, Mango, Safair, etc.
If the seats were better it would make the flight more comfortable. Also since it was a 4 hour flight there were no individual TV sets for passengers, just a couple of small screens throughout the aircraft, with nothing interesting to watch. The other issues was with the earphones provided by the airline -they didnt work and anyway it wasn't worth watching what was being screened.

"I am a regular flyer with British Airways to Mauritius but had to get an urgent, very last minute flight there for 2 of us over a weekend. First impressions do count and when I initially tried BA (on the internet), no flights were available for several days. I saw that Air Mauritius advertised their customer services phone number as 24/7 (not so with BA which was closed) and so I tried it at 11.30pm on a Sat eve. No problem - straight through to a very helpful call centre in MRU itself. The next flight from LHR had just 1 seat available. However, they simply bumped another single passenger up to Business class and thus 2 seats were now available on their flight. Tremendous - I was pleased.
The flight boarded on time and despite a short delay at LHR because it was busy, we arrived on schedule in MRU. The flight was uneventful but I got a seat next to my wife which also pleased me. Cabin crew were pleasant and helpful as I would expect. Food fine. English is the pre-dominant language used by the crew although both French/Creole is fluent to all their staff. Only things that are better with BA are: 1) their entertainment screens are larger and entertainment options more varied - I found it difficult to see using the AM one - too small and 2) the selection of snacks when cruising is not as good. Two final big pluses though for AM - 1) they allowed 30kg of luggage per person as standard, this is 30% more than BA and 2) they have daytime flights - all of the BA flights are overnight and at very inconvenient times. So, will I now convert from BA to Air Mauritius. Let me simply say that I have applied for my AM frequent flyer Kestrel card and hope to use it regularly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3MartinL,Martin L wrote a review Aug 2016,Martin L,"London, United Kingdom",79 contributions,35 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r399855701-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Will I convert from British Airways ?,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have just recently returned from 11 days in Mauritius with my husband to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary. We booked with Virgin Holidays which was excellent but had to fly Air Mauritius to get a direct flight. Outward flight was late taking off. The crew were very unfriendly, unhelpful and had miserable faces! It was a 12 hour flight and a horrible experience. My screen locked during the flight and I politely asked a crew member if they could unlock it. After 30 minutes I asked again, It took them one and a half hours to correct my screen. I was scared to ask for anything because they were not very approachable. Our return flight was slightly more pleasurable although our screens were dated as the films were not instant, we had to wait until the film finished to watch it completely and of poor quality. The staff seemed a little better except for one who had a haughty attitude - 'if looks could kill' ! the 3 meals we had during our 12 hour flight were ALL Chicken. Fish was the other option but I don't eat fish. I have never been so disappointed as I was with the Air Mauritius flights and would never use them again!

"The legroom in economy class is smaller than most other airlines. The passengers occupying seats 16G and 16H on the flight from Mauritius to Chennai on 11 July 2016 thought they paid for both their seats and ours. They repeatedly hit us on the knees with their seats and insisted it was their right to do this. The cabin staff were very unsympathetic to our needs to the extent that they ignored us or the rest of the flight without even offering us any service. Disgusting for cabin staff...Air Mauritius train your staff to be objective. However, when we got off the ""culprit"" in front of me was a tiny woman who was approximately 45kgs who kept on saying she was ""tall"" and needed extra legroom.

"Flew from London Heathrow to Mauritius with Air Mauritius. Groundstaff was not nice at all, we had a boarding card from Trondheim, it made a hudge problem to them, we had to wait longer. Staff on board was helpfull and very friendly.
Food was very average.
Entertainment was very tragic. This route uses the old style entertainment system, which plays a set number of films on loop. Inflight entertainment system was old and not flexible and the screens were unclear; very bad quality monitors and headphones, we could actually nothing to see and hear.
The seat were uncomfortable, very poor legroom.
 They lost my luggage, no one knew why or where it was. We had waited for 5days without any information from the Air MAuritius.

"We are flying as a family of 5 to Mauritius for holiday. Our flight to Mauritius was seated perfectly together and I had the option, since January when I booked and paid for the flights, to change my seat. Our flight back was different though. We were seated not together, but around each other. My daughter, who is 9, is a firm believer in stranger danger and is worried she is going to get someone strange next to her. My son, who is 12, suffers from air sickness so luckily for us he gets to sit next to his mom. On asking why we are seated so strangely I was met with ""Don't know will see what I can do"" just to be told the flight is full and most people are through already, this is 2 hours 30 min before the flight.  So to no avail this shows that tour groups and operators get preference to families who then get split. SAA also flies here from RSA and Emirates and with them you can seat yourself and change seats at all times.

"I  expressed some trepidation about flying with an unknown airline across a vast amount of water,  anywhere actually, -  but  the manager of the tour group we were travelling with - Trade Travel - assured me that she had flown with them repeatedly, and had never had cause for concern.  Well, Mauritian Air still does things that the other airlines have abandoned.  I think they handed out damp towels ( how could I not be sure ? ),  followed by little packets of socks, eyemask etc - a lot of people used the masks.  NOT that that is indicative of competent pilots or maintenance of planes !!! ........  Meals were up to airline food standard, plane very clean, some toiletries in some toilets - I guess they get pinched !  We were in cattle class, because that's what we could afford, and it is always an exercise in endurance .  I am short so leg room is rarely an issue, my travel companion is tall.  There was a fixture under the seats which impinged on legroom even for me.  I try to get an aisle seat, because I don't mind getting out for other people, but I don't like having to climb over other passengers.  One thing that  could be improved,  there wasn't a frequent round  of drinks - water and juice - which I use because I believe it is important to keep well hydrated.  I don't like  using the call bell, but I rang for a couple of drinks. I didn't use the inflight entertainment as I read for most of the flight.    The crew was  nicely dressed, polite and seemed to be attentive to people who needed assistance.   Most flights from Australia are long, and you just have to settle down and  try to relax.

"This was my first time flying with Air Mauritius and I hope it won't be my last ( my return flight next week is via Paris with Air France so watch out for that review ). The flight on the Airbus A3400-300 ( 3B-NAY for all you plane spotters ) left very slightly late but that was not the fault of the airline. At a tad over 6 feet tall I was impressed by the leg room which I felt for economy class was very good. The crew were very attentive and I was quietly surprised by the 2 meals that were served during the 12 hour flight. For supper I opted for the seafood casserole over the thai chicken choice, and the breakfast was a plain omelette with a sausage, potato a small tomato and surprisingly broccoli. The only disappointment for me was the entertainment system which was very dated but I suppose not a surprise for an aircraft that has been in service for over 19 years. The travel kit provided was a nice touch and as the plane was only half full there was plenty of room to bed down for the night but I'm guessing that this isn't the norm.
checkin and customs etc on arrival were all very smooth but baggage collection was a little slow.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0d/7f/4f/86/phiish.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phiish,Phiish wrote a review May 2016,Phiish,"Wellingborough, United Kingdom",195 contributions,19 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r372126503-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Air Mauritius...almost delicious,Date of travel: May 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've flown with Air Mauritius many years ago and because of that experience I've decided to book a Flight/Hotel/Transfer package through the airline.

The legroom on the A319 was worse than the budget airlines on domestic routes in South Africa. I'm 1.78m tall and my knees were pushing against the seat in front of me. My partner, who is 2.05m tall and slim had to sit sideways in his seat with his feet also under the seat in front of me as it was just impossible for him to fit his upper legs in the available legroom.

We were asked, by the cabin crew, not to recline our seats as it will leave no space for the passengers behind us, so we had to sit the entire 4 hour flight in cramped upright positions. The air conditioning was terrible as it was hot and humid inside the plane for the entire flight.

The hotel that they advertised as 4 star (Blumarine Attitude) was terrible and we decided to rather check out and forfeit the money (about 1000 euro) for the remainder of the stay, after the third sleepless night and horrible meals.

We check in, at our own cost (another 1000 euro), into a different 4 star hotel (La Pirogue which should be 40 stars compared to the hotel we left)

I've sent Air Mauritius an e-mail, 4 days ago, about our complaints, I'm now back in South Africa and haven't even received an automated reply. With the service we've received so far from Air Mauritius, I doubt that we will get any response from the airline.

Whatever you do, do not book a hotel through Air Mauritius and ensure that any hotel booking has a free cancellation policy.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/e0/8f/15/naas51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaasvZyl,NaasvZyl wrote a review May 2016,NaasvZyl,"Midrand, South Africa",56 contributions,20 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r370062279-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Trip from Hell,Date of travel: April 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was truly flying “cattle class” and I had to sit sideways since there was very little leg room. South African budget airlines have more leg room than this. Aircon was either not working or was off and only seemed to work once we landed. On the flight back to Johannesburg we were given an exit seating with plenty of legroom (after we bitterly complained and threatened to take pictures of the legroom). The only problem was that we had to get blankets because we were freezing (pressed the button for the air hostess at least three times to get the blankets, eventually got up and walked to her and reminded her that I requested a blanket) and either a family member/friend/etc. sat across us where the air hostess is supposed to sit taking up my partner’s legroom, also uncomfortable with someone sitting across you on a four-hour flight.

"I was on my honeymoon to Mauritius & Had wonderful experience with this flight. precisely better that other Asian airlines I would have ever used . Although the Queue for Check-in was little long but still this airline has been wonderful to us.
After completing all the necessary protocols they started with welcome drink that was both with & without alcohol. I took White wine which was amazing , food quality was also good for Indian Vegetarians. There was no limit to beverages served and you can take as many times as required,
Air Mauritius also provides you with a welcome kit which includes a pen, a pair of socks, eat plugs , eye mask and a small side bag , which I took both the times.
Air hostess were really welcoming & helpful.
In house Facility were awesome.
Most comfortable flight but leg room is very tight. as the flight was for more than hours or so the legroom was little tight as we cant feel

"This was honestly the worst experience I have had. I requested an alcoholic beverage, and was told that ""drinking in the air is not the same as drinking on the ground"". Bearing in mind I am 28 years old and mature, I wasn't understanding where this came from. I was walking at the back of the plane with a cup in my hand, and told I had to sit down. I then indicated it was healthy to walk around the plane to prevent DVT. The stewardess then grabbed my arm and attempted to pull me. I was shocked that this happened. She began screaming and shouting at me. She then said she would put me into prison in mauritius. I felt completely threatened for not doing anything. THIS IS HONESTLY THE WORST AIRLINE IN THIS WORLD. DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THEM, HOWEVER LOW THE PRICES ARE. THEY ARE CORRUPT. I then complained to the airline, and was told they investigated it, and I was apparently in the wrong.

"I've been travelling MK since I was a kid and I've seen major improvements at this airline. I'm especially familiar with the MRU-CDG route but have also flown to various African and Asian destinations. Although the aircraft isn't young (waiting for A350s to be delivered), the cabins were renovated a few years ago and are well maintained. Staff is willing and helpful. Food can be a bit disappointing depending on the route, but overall satisfying. The facilities at MRU Airport aren't first class, but have also significantly improved since the opening of the new terminal in 2013. Prices are pretty high but in line with other competitors in direct flights, considering the convenient timing of the flights and frequency. Keep the good work going!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/32/bb/63/melanie-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826melanieb,Melanie B wrote a review Mar 2016,Melanie B,,34 contributions,13 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Paris,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r354017727-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Professional service and convenient frequency,Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We had a good experience in this flight. Air Mauritius takes care of its passengers and has a good in-flight entertainment. You get a good customer service from the crew members. you get good food as well (even for vegetarians). The only issue I had was for a little legroom. Extra legroom will be more comfortable.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/e9/78/2f/ashutosh-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashutoshj1,Ashutosh J wrote a review Mar 2016,Ashutosh J,"Brampton, Canada",40 contributions,18 helpful votes,Mumbai - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r352302212-Air_Mauritius-World.html,Good airline.

"The flight out was very straight forward, pretty much what we expected.  It was a direct night flight.  Dinner was nice with a good selection of food and generally friendly staff.  Unfortunately the flight back was not to pleasing.  Although i was sat in my chair normally (isle seat), i still found myself being bumped by isle walkers including staff with out and apology.  The dinner was chicken and had about 3 big bits of gristle in it.  The breakfast was not nice either, at 5.30am the last thing i wanted was a chicken flavoured frankfurter and a lukewarm omelette.  The bread roll did fine though.  The staff never really acknowledged what i was saying and it felt like they had to walk around smiling rather than want to.  Generally an ok flight but i have had much better with other companies.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/80/7e/3d/nick-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickR946,Nick R wrote a review Feb 2016,Nick R,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",126 contributions,74 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729008-r351226411-Air_Mauritius-World.html,A Generally Pleasant Flight,Date of travel: February 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
