"My return trip was - out on Monday and back on Friday! A seamless flight which kept time during both legs, overseen by efficient, courteous staff. The snacks were fresh. However, there is a need to watch the high sugar and salt content. There was a slight muddle at check-in in Victoria Falls over ticketing, but that was swiftly resolved. A bonus on the trip was flying over the Falls on the way from Victoria Falls- a spectacular sight! Fastjet is a small and efficient airline which makes the round trip worth repeating.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kufunda,Kufunda wrote a review Nov 2022,Kufunda,"Harare, Zimbabwe",355 contributions,118 helpful votes,Harare - Victoria Falls,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r868475952-Fastjet-World.html,Spoilt for choice!,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

So we are frequent flyers with the airline and we  purchased the Best fare they have that includes 2 big suite cases. When we arrive to the check in counter they said we can only take one suite case each and they made us leave the other suitcase at the airport !!! Their incompetent staff at Harare airport said we did not had the suitcase included and we paid 300 dollars each for this!!!. We had a hard time  with this. We found a solution ourselves to get our suitcases back . They did not help us with this! They replied our email after 3 days and never ever said anything! I emailed with you Customer Service agent Melisa.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marilopez2022,Mari Lopez wrote a review Nov 2022,Mari Lopez,,2 contributions,,Harare - Victoria Falls,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r867524458-Fastjet-World.html,Worst customer service,Date of travel: October 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The 10.30 flight to Kruger International airport in South Africa could not take off due to a technical error on plane. A plane and crew were miraculously found approx. 90 mins later (around 12 noon). The light I was booked on at 1 pm to go from Vic Falls to Johannesburg was then reported to have a technical fault at 12.50 pm. That’s two technical faults on two planes … unless you hypothesise that they sent to 1 pm plane bound to Johannesburg to Kruger instead, but that would mean passengers were not told the truth. Ended up leaving Victoria Falls on another plane at 14.10 - almost missed my connecting flight from Johannesburg to Australia.

"My boss was on the last Fastjet flight for the day and had a connecting flight at ORT to fly to DBN, Fastjet got delayed a bit in Bulawayo. He informed the crew that he has a connecting flight in JHB and cannot miss the flight, else he will have to sleep at the airport. The crew was very understanding and did everything in their power to assist. They let ground staff know at ORT to keep the gate open for him and explained why he will be delayed. When they arrived at ORT, he was allowed to disembark the plane first, a car was waiting for him at the aircraft, they took him straight to passports. He was well on time for his connecting flight!

"Travelled on FAST JET last flight of the day on the 15th Aug. Even though the service was delayed, they made up for in in customer service. The check in staff were very friendly and efficient and when we eventually boarded we had an exceptionally amazing air hostess ( If my memory serves me right her name was Micheala) The pilot was really nice and had a great sense of humour ,always updated the passengers of the delay and was very apologetic. After having having travelled for a long day and a half with terrible staff and crew attitudes on previous airlines, this flight was a breath of fresh air!

"So  I was  booked to  fly from  Johannesburg  to  Harare  on 3  August  2022  at  15.15. I had  purchased the ticket  through Flight  Centre  Rosebank. Today, 4  august, I’m  still in Johannesburg  with no  idea  when or  whether  I will ever  fly on that ticket. I presented myself  at  the Fastjet  checkin  counter  over  2  and  a half  hours  before  departure. I presented to  them  my valid  passport  and  negative  covid test  result, which test  had  been done on 2 August. To  my horror, I was  informed that  I wasn’t  booked on the flight  and  should consult  with the Fastjet  reservation office  which was  conveniently located directly behind  the check initial reception was  courteous. The gentlemen manning  the counter  checked my ticket  and  informed me that  inin  counters. My their  system my ticket  had  been cancelled. I  called  Flight  Centre  Rosebank who  immediately spoke to  the Fastjet folks. I guess  I should note  that  the Fastjet  counter  is  manned by Menzies  staff  who  provide services to  Fastjet. Obviously, the intricacies  of these  relationships  are  lost  on me. As  far  as  I was  concerned I was  dealing  with Fastjet. The conversations  between Fastjet  and  Flight  Centre  Rosebank continued until  boarding  closed and the plane  departed. As  I don’t  live  in  Johannesburg, my next  concer n was  accommodation food and transport  to  get  to  the accommodation.  Around  5pm, I communicated again with Flight  Centre Rosebank who  informed me that  at  that  point  it  was  unlikely that  I would fly that  day, notwithstanding  the fact  that  there  was  a Fastjet flight  leaving  for  Harare  after  6  pm. I shared my concerns  re  accommodation etc  with accommodation etc. They advised that  I check into  a hotel and retain all my receipts. In  the aftermath of  this  mess  they would seek reimbursement  from  Fastjet. Thus, my search for  a hotel began. City Lodge  OR Tambo  and  InterContinental  OR Tambo  were  both fully booked. I  proceeded to  the shuttle parking  lot  and  eventually managed shuttle driver  from  Birchwood Hotel and Conference  centre  to  book the last with the help  of  a room  they had. Note that  the search for  a hotel room  involved walking  around  the airport  for  more  than two  hours dragging  behind  my 30kgs  of  luggage. I woke up this  morning  4  August  uncertain.  Everything  about  this  trip  is  now  uncertain.  By  9.30am  I had spoken to  Flight  Centre  Rosebank who  were  commencing  the second  round in the battle with Fastjet  to  secure  me  a seat  for  a flight  I booked and paid  for  more  than a week ago. I’m  sitting  at  the BC  Café  at  the Birchwood Hotel and Conference  Centre  watching  f lights  landing  at  departing  from OR Tambo. I think its  been over  48  hours  since  I took my  covid test  so  it  may no  longer  be valid  for entry into  Zimbabwe. In  the event  that  Fastjet  succeeds  in  securing  a seat  for  me today, I will  have the worry of  the Covi d test where  to  get  one done. I noticed that  the Dischem  covid testing  station in  OR Tambo  has  been dismantled. I have  kept  receipts  for  the hotel and for  a early dinner  I  had yesterday. While  Flight  Centre Rosebank may fight for  a reimbursement  of  thes e  expenses Fastjet  may refuse  any such request. I got a call from Flight Centre Rosebank notifying me to get to the airport cos i had been waitlisted for the 6pm flight. I took the hotel shuttle and  endured a long wait before being checked in. Fast forward to a couple of hours later.  We landed in Harare to find most of our luggage had been left in joburg. There was much wailing among the passengers some of whom were attending weddings early the next day. Judging by the rows of luggage arranged in different groupings,  i guess, indicating different flights, leaving luggage was the norm. So on 5 August, I went back to the Harare airport at 5pm to collect my luggage.  So what is supposed to be a 1.40 minute flight between Johannesburg and Harare turned out to be a saga starting on 3 August and ending on 5 August. And Fastjet believes I was not sufficiently inconvenienced.

"When British Airways canceled my flight to Zim, I had no choice but to rebook on the only other carrier available which was Fastjet.  At first the name gave me a chuckle because nothing really moves fast in Africa.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience.  Check-in at Joburg was smooth and efficient.  The modern Embraer jet was clean and comfortable for a short flight.  The air hostess was very friendly and handed each passenger a box with hand sanitizer and a juice box upon boarding.  We landed on time and our baggage was quickly offloaded.  Overall this was a very positive experience.

"I always fly Airlink and thought I would give Fastjet a try. What an absolute disappointment. First, I was informed that my flight was completely canceled while checking in my luggage. This was an evening flight so this means I would only be able to go home the next day. There were absolutely no notifications sent out so all the passengers showed up to the airport. The staff assisted everyone who's been disrupted in booking them on the next available flight, the next morning at 6am. Everyone was told that check-in starts at 4h40am. Again, all the passengers arrived early only to be told, once again upon check-in, that the flight will be delayed up until 10h30am.

I booked a flight with fastjet for 10 December 2019 from bulawayo to Johannesburg. Flight was supposed to be at 6.40am to arrive in Johannesburg at 8am. We checked in as usual and boarded. After about 15 minutes into the stationary plane we were asked to disembark and wait  in the lounge for 5minuted since the plane had a technical fault. The 5 minutes turned to hours and were promised three times that another plane was coming from Johannesburg to take us. All proved to be false promises since along the way we would be told that the plane was forced to turn back to Johannesburg midway through it's journey. It was false promise after false promise throughout the day and after a lot of shouting and complaining they had to put us on a South Africa Express flight which left bulawayo at after 6PM. Again we had another wait before takeoff with South Africa Express since they were given wrong names by fastjet. I finally arrived in Johannesburg around 7.45pm. I would like to point out that we had a great flight with South Africa Express...great service thank you.This is a journey I wouldn't like to remember.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amuguti1,amuguti1 wrote a review Dec 2019,amuguti1,"Zvishavane, Zimbabwe",4 contributions,,Bulawayo - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r731952235-Fastjet-World.html,My horrible experience with fastjet ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was delayed for on-boarding by the Airport restaurant due to POS machine that could only accept international cards and not local cards. This was at the international terminal. A boarding call was announced but i did not get it since i was at the International terminal having breakfast. A last boarding call was then announced at the international terminal and that is when the Restaurant staff started making frantic efforts to get another POS machine from their coffee shop at the domestic terminal. They asked me to rush straight for security check whilst bringing the POS machine. Apologies were made to the Airport staff and they understood the cause of the delay however the Flight Captain had already made a decision for dropping the passenger way before the allowable time. There were discussions between the airport staff and the flight crew and eventually the airport staff advised to walk briskly on the tarmac and not run and board as the allowable time is still within acceptable limit. After boarding it took about 20 minutes before the door was closed. However, i am grateful to both airport staff and flight crew for reaching an amicable solution in allowing me to continue with the flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sphiri2018,sphiri2018 wrote a review Oct 2019,sphiri2018,,16 contributions,1 helpful vote,Victoria Falls - Harare,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r722951073-Fastjet-World.html,Delayed on-boarding,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We in Zimbabwe really hoped that FastJet could take on Air Zimbabwe and their dismal record. After a promising start, they seem to be going the way of many African businesses; service is ok (as you'd expect for a budget airline) but the kicker is their timeliness - they just can't get it together.

"I was extremely hesitant to use this airline because of all the negative reviews.  However, it was the best option I could find for a flight to Vic Falls, so I booked through a third party who guarantees flights, and purchased flight insurance.  These precautions proved to be completely unnecessary.  I had a positive experience using this airline.  You simply need to read the airline's policies carefully and follow them.First, they state clearly that your flight time may change.  They also state that if the incoming flight arrives early, your flight may leave early.  So, I started checking the flight updates the evening before to make sure there were no changes.  I also showed up at the airport early, when check-in opened, which was over an hour early.Yes, this required some effort and some additional time spent in some very boring airports, but I made both my outgoing and return flight with absolutely no issues.The staff is friendly and helpful.  The flight was uneventful, and they serve a decent snack of two different pastries and a bottle of water.The plane was older (think ashtrays in the armrests!), but clean and appeared to be well-maintained.I think you need to remember that people are often more likely to write a negative review than a positive one.  So, the reviews you read may not accurately reflect the majority of customers of Fast Jet.

This is bad enough. However:
They never bothered to contact us about it in any way shape or form (email, phone, text, etc.) They also never reimbursed us!

This means that we arrived at Kili airport expecting to get on our flight only to be told there that it wasn't going to happen. We had to scramble to organize the rest of our trip, all of which ended up costing us a lot of money and wasting a lot of our time in Tanzania.

"On December 23, 2018, at 3:30 p.m., my family (husband and two children) and I got to Victoria Falls International Airport (“VFA”) to get Fastjet flight number 8004 to Johannesburg (“JNB”), that was supposed to departure at 17:40p.m. on that day, as per the confirmation we received from FastJet booking number YVTY1S by e-mail on March 18, 2018.

Arriving at VFA we went to Fastjet counter and we, for our surprise, were informed that such flight had already taken off at 10:30a.m. that day. And worse, there were no other flights from VFA to JNB on December 23, 2018!!

So we were stuck at VFA with no place to go for that night.

Please note that we have not received any e-mail from FastJet warning or informing us about the change of the flight.

We went to Fastjet’s ground crew office at VFA to try to find information and help and after several hours talking to them and with them on the phone with their supervisor we were informed that there was nothing FastJet could do to help us!!! It was so unbelievable!!!! I could not believe that FastJet would leave my family and I completally unattended in the middle of Africa!!! They did not even booked us on the next flight that was on the followinf day!

"Be warned fellow travellers thinking of using Fast Jet. I made an advance online booking with Fastjet because it offered a mid-morning flight at a convenient time on the date I wished to travel. Fastjet cancelled the flight and then informed me I needed to buy another (full-price) ticket. Yes folks. Their policy is is they cancel, you can pay for a new ticket. When I protested, Fast jet offered me a flight leaving at 6;30 am. This was not convenient, and they repeated that my options were, take this flight or buy a new ticket. After the exchange of many messages, my travel agent won an agreement from Fastjet that I could book a later flight on the same date, with no extra fees for the change of bookings. However when I arrived at Dar es Salaam to board my flight, I was informed that I must pay booking fees first. The booking fees were almost exactly the same price as new ticket. The booking clerk was incredibly rude and unhelpful. When asked for a receipt the clerk replied that Fastjet policy was not to give receipts. When pressed to supply proof of payment the clerk became belligerent. I boarded, after paying the fees. To make things worse, the plane sat on the runway for an hour after departure time, due to technical difficulties Fastjet was experiencing. So be warned. If you really need to use this airline, I suggest you book and fly immediately. I urge fellow travellers to boycott this airline until they change their policy. There are other, more reputable airlines, that fly the same routes.

"Our flight to MBEYA has been cancelled recently (Saturday 27 October). We were at the gate ready to boar and some fastjet personnel just pop up and explain that the flight has been cancelled. Okay that is not fair. But this is not my point really.
A person from the fastjet office has giving us a paper pretending that we will be fully refund - Formal paper with all the necessary stamps. But it did not manage to get any refund when back home.

Wanted to book a flight from Victoria Falls to Jo'burg in late September through their website.  However the day we wanted (30/9) was available a few months ago then disappeared during August.

"I was due to fly to Kilimanjaro with Fastjet in August and on the morning of my flight it was cancelled. All I received was an email. Arriving in Tanzania that afternoon I did not check my email. At least a text message would have been appropriate. So I went to the desk and they offered me a refund or reschedule. Since I needed to be climbing Kilimanjaro, their reschedule was inappropriate. So I got another airline to fly me, with fastjet promising a refund had been arranged. On getting back to London I find that only my baggage claim was refunded and not the  flight. After many emails I was promised a refund within 21 days of the flight. This came and went and no luck. Now they don't even respond to my emails. Extremely poor customer service all round.

"I booked this flight about 3 months in advance of my departure of the 17th of January 2017. I arrived from UK to Tanzania after about 20 hours of travelling fully expecting to go onto my next flight to Kilimanjaro after just a couple hours more wait.

After looking on the board, the only flight I could see was 14 hours from the current time. After asking the guy at the fastjet office, he said the previous plane had been cancelled and that was the new one. There was no offer of a hotel or compensation for this. I ended up booking a flight with another airline which cost $160 dollars because there was no way I was waiting 14 hours in the Dar heat.

FastJets website states they would inform you of a schedule change, of which they did not. When I got back to UK, I did get a refund for my flight quite easily, so 2* for that fact, and I did fly with them back from Kilimanjaro to Dar es salaam with no issues.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marrioa05,marrioa05 wrote a review May 2018,marrioa05,"Reading, United Kingdom",111 contributions,89 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r579242745-Fastjet-World.html,"Nice airline, plane cancelled with no notice",Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Used FastJet to travel from Harare to Victoria Falls. Prices were favorable compared to Air Zimbabwe. The fares for checked baggage however is a bit high. Also, beware of making any mistakes during booking. The will charge you full price for any changes the have to make. Even though FastJet is founded by the same man who founded EasyJet, the latter will help you out if you made a mistake and called them immediately. Not FastJet though.

Departed in the morning and returned late in the afternoon. Both flights were without trouble. Check in at Harare was fast and since it was a domestic flight there weren’t any customs issues. The flight was so short, you won’t need to make any inflight purchases.
The stewardesses were friendly on both flights.

"We were supposed to fly on the 16th of March with Fastjet only to receive few hours before my flight an email saying that my flight had changed to FN 154. The email that I got was not clear at all not stating which flight had changed(no flight number or departure airport was mentioned) so I assumed that the flight on the 16th of March had changed. I emailed the airline but had no response back so I had to book another flight from Dar es Salam to Kilimanjaro which cost me the triple of what I had booked with Fastjet. I arrived at the airport and went to Fastjet desk only to be told that this flight was on time and I was too late(the flight was leaving in 35 min). I showed them the email and they told me that flight change refers to the returning flight. I don't understand how can you change a flight without mentioning the flight number or departure time.
My return flight changed from 21:30 to 12:30. Needless to say that this flight change didn't suit me at all as I was on a safari and obviously couldn't make it.
I had to book another flight coming back with Precision Air as FastJet didn't offer any other flight times and again the cost was triple.

I expected a refund for this inconvenience as it was totally unfair what the airline did and the cost for the other flights that I had to rebook was ridiculous but that never happened!

"Two of our volunteers booked through Opodo from Manchester to Mwanza.
The first two flights were with Emirates and then the last flight was with Fastjet.
On arrival at Dar Fastjet said they had not paid even though they had the complete booking form and e-ticket with them. They said they would have to pay again and when they agreed they said their card machine was not working so they would have to pay cash. An official from fast jet accompanied them to a cash machine but the amount they could draw was limited and the limit was not enough to pay for the tickets.
They were eventually allowed on the plane owing a small balance. When they landed at Mwanza they were not allowed off the plane until they had paid the balance which they managed to do with other currencies.

It was very convenient for business trips with ease of flight connection from Entebbe / Kilimajaro / Dar es Salaam / Entebbe and the flight timing.  This connection shifted a huge clientele from KQ at the time.  Withdrawal of this flight route was devastating to its faithful users.  We urge Fastjet to return Entebbe / Kilimajaro / Dar es Salaam / Entebbe.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/fb/51/ac/blue-ocean-safaris.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/by_mboya_travels,Joseph Mboya wrote a review Feb 2018,Joseph Mboya,"Nairobi, Kenya",20 contributions,2 helpful votes,Entebbe - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r560707766-Fastjet-World.html,"Fastjet, a low-cost carrier changing the flight fares in Africa",Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"- We used Fastjet to and from Johannesburg.
- We were a group of 23 people had an excellent experience with Fastjet. The booking was well managed upto the last day. We paid a deposit of 25% of the total amount and then spread the balance over 3 months. This was very affordable to all group members.
- The check-in process was very smooth considering the size of the group
and never had any issues with the baggage
- The cabin is fantastic considering the size of the plane
- The seats and comfortable and have enough resting space
- Very punctual
- Was very much impressed by the smooth take-of and landing - never felt anything!!!

"We booked this flight a few days in advance and went through a travel agent in Arusha to do so. The travel agent was able to get a much better rate for us than what was published online by Fastjet. However we were not told (and thus shocked to find out) that there is a hefty fee for each bag we check in! We had to scramble at the airport in order to move stuff around between bags to reduce our check-in to one and make sure our carry-on bags don't exceed the weight limit (the airline agent meticulously weighed everything). This bag fee came as a surprise to many of the other tourists/travelers ahead of us in line. The bag fees alone were almost half the cost of the ticket.

The plane was small but clean and comfortable and we were offered refreshments as well as snacks for purchase. Overall a pleasant experience if not for the hustle with the bag fees.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/c4/02/a8/barzinji.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barzinji,Barzinji wrote a review Jan 2018,Barzinji,"Sterling, Virginia",127 contributions,162 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Dar es Salaam,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r553251431-Fastjet-World.html,Pleasant and On-Time Flight - Be Aware of Hidden Bag Fees!!!,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I was very disappointed by Fastjet airlines. Firstly there was an extra charge on the luggage which should have been included when booking the tickets. Most passengers were left stranded because they had no money to pay for their bags. Each bag is charged at R500.00. Secondly the flight was overbooked and they had to request 3 passengers to remain behind in order for them to fly and this caused serious delays as no one was willing to be offloaded off the plane.NEVER AGAIN WILL I BOOK FASTJET.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NothaboN1,Nothabo N wrote a review Jan 2018,Nothabo N,,1 contribution,,Johannesburg - Harare,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r552380572-Fastjet-World.html,Delayed Flight and extra costs,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was my 2nd experience flying Fastjet return between Jhb and Harare. Flying between these 2 cities has to be one of the most profitable routes in sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps 2nd only to the price gouging of other airlines on the Jhb-Gaborone route

Don't fall for the advertising classifying them as a low-cost carrier - On this route, ticket prices range from borderline expensive to deep into rip-off category. Specifically, if you consider that everything from baggage to insurance to onboard drinks and snacks could be charged on top of the basic ticket price. To put their pricing in perspective - for the price 2 adults fly 1120 km to Harare return, 1.5 adults can fly return to Bangkok or Europe (3 or more meals, drinks, snacks and luggage and other niceties included with a distance exceeding 10 x or more further)

- On check-in, the agent tried to force me to pay extra for excess luggage, and after redirecting me to another counter where staff merely assisted queue jumpers first, it turned out luggage was included in the ticket price paid after all;
- On return, we booked a wheelchair for an elderly passenger, which never arrived. No explanation was given, and no effort was made to find somebody to help, despite other airlines' elderly passengers being assisted while we waited ;
- The plane was delayed by +- 1.5 hrs, no adequate explanation given;
- On arrival at Jhb (ORTIA) no wheelchair assistance was available to disembark or inside the airport - staff presumably went home or were sleeping

Fastjet operates both Airbus and Embraer ERJ-190's.

We were on our way back to Europe and therefore booked the flight from Kilimanjaro to the capital. From there we had our connecting flights to Istanbul Some hours before our flight fastjet cancelled the flight because there were not enough customers. In the end we missed all our flights and had to buy new tickets to Europe. No statement from fastjet. 1 month later they replied our email saying that we should call before the flight and its our fault.

fastjet cancelled my flight from Kilimanjaro to Daressalaam during the night without ANY message or communication. I got the info from the busdriver.

"Yes, the tickets prices are cheap, but it's not worth the extra time, money, and hassle. I booked a round trip flight from Dar to Kilimanjaro and never stepped foot on a FastJet plane because both flights were cancelled! They did not inform us on the cancellation via email or text. We found out when we got to the airport (thankfully we arrived super early), and a random airport worker asked us which flight we were on. We were informed that ""oh, FastJet usually cancel flights. You should check with the desk to see if it's still going."" It was not. We were then put on a Precision Air flight that was scheduled to leave an hour later than the original FastJet. Thankfully we got a seat on the Precision flight, but many of the other FastJet customers did not. Okay, part one of the FastJet wasn't *too* bad. But now buckle up for part two.

On the return trip to Dar, we drove 1.5 hour to JRO from Arusha. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early (just to be safe again). Surprise, surprise, we found out that--even though we had a booked and PAID for seats on the flight--we were kicked off the flight...along with 20 other customers who also booked and paid for seats. Apparently, FastJet cancelled a flight the day before and booked all those passengers on our flight. Again, there was *zero* communication regarding this update. Unfortunately, all the other airlines were either full or charging way too much (~$350 USD for a one-way ticket from JRO-->DAR, which is one-hour flight) for a ticket. FastJet's solution? Put on us the same flight tomorrow. After complaints from many other upset customers, FastJet finally gave everyone some accommodation and transportation money to make up for their error. This wasn't possible for us since we needed to be in Dar that evening. We later found out that FastJet was lying about the flight, and it was actually cancelled. We ended up driving 1.5 hour back to Arusha and went straight to the FastJet offices and asked for refund. They said they would issue a refund (but demanded us to give back the transportation money they originally gave us...). She said we should see the refund within 10-15 business days. It has been a whole month and we have yet to see any refund. We ended up getting a flight from Arusha airport with FlightConnection and it cost around $160 USD since it was so last minute.

TLDR: Don't book with FastJet. They have a reputation of cancelling flights and not refunding their customers. Not sure how that's legal, but that's the case. I recommend booking with Precision Air or Air Tanzania instead.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sengupta2010,sengupta2010 wrote a review Dec 2017,sengupta2010,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1 contribution,4 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r548618626-Fastjet-World.html,Don't book with FastJet (unless you want ALL your flights cancelled...),Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Most affordable airline i think but don't bank your plans on the date you book because from experience our flight was cancelled and changed several times.

"Had a flight booked a month in advance on FastJet, set to depart at 7:30 PM. On arriving to the airport, after 8 hours of flights from Cape Town to Dar es Salaam, we were told unapologetically that the flight was cancelled and we would have to fly at 11 AM the next day.

After not taking ""no"" for an answer for a few hours, we eventually booked a different flligt on Air Tanzania (paid cash last minute at the airport) and are currently in the process of waiting on a refund we've been told will be issued within 7 working days. I'm not convinced, and have been calling the contact center to to try to move things forward.

We also had booked a FastJet flight later this week out of Kilimanjaro, but have now booked a 2nd flight on a different airline. FastJet says they can't refund that upcoming flight because ""we don't know yet if there will be a problem; if there is a problem we will let you know, for now it's your personal decision to cancel.""

I suspect FastJet often cancels the last flight of the day on the day-of if it isn't full enough.

I feel bad for other folks on our flight who didn't get to the airport five hours early and have time to make alternate arrangements. I imagine they weren't able to get FastJet to help, and so likely lost a day; hopefully didn't miss their safari!

I would highly recommend Air Tanzania for transfer from Dar to Kilimanjaro, by the way. Very friendly and efficient service; we would have been stranded without them. Seems to be just as affordable as FastJet as well.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/47/22/88/daniel-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielH775,Daniel H wrote a review Nov 2017,Daniel H,,9 contributions,1 helpful vote,Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r543507024-Fastjet-World.html,Avoid traveling FastJet unless you're ok with last-minute cancellation,Date of travel: November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had booked our flight prior to arriving in Tanzania and today were scheduled to leave DAR at 10:10 am. When we checked in, the flight had been cancelled without any notification. The next flight (at 2:15 pm) was unavailable to us. We were basically told 'too bad' without refund or helping us.
We were not impressed and kept bugging, and were switched to Precision airline which took us to Arusha rather than JRO, but we were okay with that.
We DID get notified that our return flight to DAR in a week will be leaving late, and we would miss our connection to ZAR. They were not the least bit concerned that we would have to forfeit our hotel, flight and ground transfers because of them.

"I try to learn from the mistakes of others, but the prospect of a cheap, direct flight from Zimbabwe to Tanzania was too appealing.

Even though my colleagues warned me about Fastjet – frequent cancellations, poor customer service – I took a chance, deciding to book a Thanksgiving weekend roundtrip.

I'll never make that mistake again.

A few days later, I received an email informing me that both of my flights had been cancelled. The departing flight was moved until two days later and the returning flight one day. Unable to fit the changes into my schedule, I cancelled the flight.

Unlike most airlines, I couldn't make arrangements over the phone to receive my refund. Instead, I had to go into one of the airline's offices, where I was told to fill out a refund form.

""Why can't I get my cash now?"" I asked. The clerk told me that the airline can only issue refunds in the manner that the ticket was purchased. Since I purchased the flight with a debit card, I could only receive a refund by having the money deposited into my checking account.

I wasn't impressed, but Africa has its share of bureaucracy. I filled out the form.

""You'll get your refund in 5-7 business days,"" the clerk assured me. I had my doubts.

After 10 business days without a refund, I recalled the office. ""The refund is in the pipeline,"" the clerk said. ""I will call you back.""

Silence for a week.

Be careful about anything Fastjet tells you. There's a strong possibility it's not true.

After 15 business days with no calls or a refund in sight, I contacted Fastjet again. Now I'd had enough, voicing my displeasure. Later that night, I received my first return call from Fastjet in 15 days. A clerk told me that I could pick up my refund at the office. I said I'd get it that weekend.

Not quite believing the news, I called again the next day (Day 16 without a refund). The operator didn't seem to know about my refund, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The manager said she would look into my situation and return my call.

Silence.

On Day 17 without a refund, it was obvious that Fastjet's customer service was incompetent. Instead, I managed to track down contact information for the company's CEO.

To his credit, the Fastjet CEO – Nico Bezuidenhout – actually passed along my information to the upper echelon of corporate management.

On Day 18, I received a lengthy email from the company's general manager of sales, confirming that I'd be able to pick up my cash. Still being skeptical, I asked for clarity on how to do so. I had visions of yet another clerk not knowing what I was talking about.

The next morning (Day 19 without a refund) the general manager indicated in an email that the matter was still being investigated, rather than telling me how to pick up the money.

The email said, ""The internal investigation thus far is pointing towards the refund having been processed by NMB on the 12th Oct (see attached). In the meanwhile, your refund remains in question as you have indicated, and wish to have feedback provided by tomorrow. Thank you for your continued patience.""

If you ever have a complaint with Fastjet, you will encounter numerous operators telling you how sorry they are for your problem and to be patient. That is all you will get – excuses, delays, and patronizing replies.

Finally, the next day, the skies cleared (Day 20 without a refund). As I'd done each morning for three weeks, I checked my bank account. My refund had suddenly appeared.

I was promised my refund would take 5-7 business days. Instead, it took 20 (27 days, if you include weekends).

When I purchased a ticket on Fastjet, I knew I was dealing with a budget airline, but even a budget airline can deliver decent customer service.

My first experience with Fastjet will be my last. The best advice I can offer potential customers is buyer beware. If you still want to risk it, be prepared for cancellations and a litany of excuses, if you ever need a refund.

Avoid the airline at all costs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/86/be/ed/markcolin.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkColin,MarkColin wrote a review Oct 2017,MarkColin,United States,80 contributions,92 helpful votes,Harare - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r536362129-Fastjet-World.html,Airline of Cancellations and Broken Promises,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"12 of us booked our trip 6 months in advance to our friends wedding. First of all it took over an hour to check in Lusaka as the procedure is for check in staff to make a photocopy of your credit card which you used to book the airticket. The photocopy machine is in the back office of the airport and doesn't work properly. There was no way in hell I would let the lady take off with my card because of fraud risk so I had to walk with her to the back room. Secondly we were delayed almost 4 hours. 2 of which we sat on the runway. It was now 3am, very tired, hungry and thirsty travellers- I asked for a drink and was told they can't serve while we were on the ground!!! As a result of the delay we missed our pre-paid ferry to Zanzibar and had to book a flight. Already money lost! On the way back to Lusaka, some passengers in our group received an e-mail a few hours before we were supposed to take off that our flight had been postponed by 4 days! We had to book a new ticket with Kenya Airways which cost us another $400 with an 8 hour layover in Nairobi. This trip turned into a very expensive trip thanks to Fast Jet. What an unreliable airline. Either way we would have had to forfeit money at a hotel or a new airticket on a different airline. Next time we will pay the higher price for guaranteed service with Kenya airways or South African Airways to Zanzibar. No one has replied to any of our e-mails to the company which just goes to show they are an unreliable airline. Refund for the leg they cancelled is also yet to appear in my account and will definitely not off-set the amount spent on the new ticket.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anabezi,Jessica L wrote a review Oct 2017,Jessica L,"Lusaka, Zambia",3 contributions,3 helpful votes,Lusaka - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r533420208-Fastjet-World.html,never again!!!!,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked a flight to Dar es Salam on the 2nd of October with a return Flight on the 9th of October. We were then crossing to Zanzibar by ferry for a wedding.

On the way there the flight was delayed by 4 hours!!! We sat on the plane for more than 2 hours waiting and we were told it was because there was no cabin spray. This is not an acceptable excuse and FastJet should know as a regular operator that this is required. The delay cause us to miss the next two ferries to Zanzibar (which we had pre-paid for). In order to get to the wedding on time now we were forced to take a flight to Zanzibar.

On the way back the flight was completely canceled for 4 days!!!! And we were given no notice. No email, No phone call, No SMS, No whats app, Nothing! Yet again we were forced to make an alternate plan by flying via Kenya and waiting in Nairobi for 8 hours to get back to ensure I was able to go to work!

Yes, the charge for extras, but their pricing is clear, is reasonably priced and can be organized in advance. We had been on a multi activity vacation and had over 100 kg of gear between three of us. They were surprised, but it was all arranged in advance and proceeded flawlessly.

"Didn't use this Airline earlier. My Friends in Haraare knew of Fastjet. Since Air Zimbabwe and many other don't operate on regular week flights to Kilimanjaro, we chose Fastjet.
While National Zimbabwe Airline seem to be loosing steam & repute, it's Fastjet's gain & is taking positive advantage in expanding flight operations across Africa.
We travelled this route Harare - Kilimanjaro-Harare. Fastjet should however re-look flight Timings to ensure Tourists gain advantage & optimize flying times (just as an example we arrived From Harare to Dar es Salaam, but we had to wait for 5 hrs for our connecting flight to Kili ,wasting time at Dar Es Salaam airport, thereby loosing most part of our day flying into Kili, loosing a full day stay in Kili (such time wasted is a major loss for Holiday makers like us who want to make the best of our holiday time).

Fast jet started off well initially but off late their service and maintenance is extremely poor. The cabin luggage compartment has to be opened through a push button system.

"I have flown previously on fastjet and was excited to get a ticket during one of their sales. We arrived late to the airport due to a late connecting flight and I had put my phone in the front pocket of my backpack which I intended to carry on the plan. After about 10 minutes waiting in line and then chatting with the agent, they claimed that my backpack needed to be checked. It was just a small laptop bag so I was a bit confused but ended up giving them the bag and checking it in. Within a few minutes, I realized I had forgot to remove my phone from the checked bag. I returned to the gate agent, asked to see my bag (I could literally see it behind the desk) and she refused to let me have it. Upon arriving in Kilimanjaro I opened my bag and my phone was gone. I attempted to report it stolen to the fastjet agent but he refused to write a report because phones are not supposed to be in checked luggage. I then contacted fastjet online support who said they could not help me unless I had a report. Fastjet has refused to take any responsibility despite the fact that one of their staff (likely from Dar) stole my phone. They wouldn't confront the staff, refund my ticket, give me any type of credit. Nothing. I couldn't even file a report. It was overall an awful experience. Fastjet refusal to take any action has been extremely frustrating. I would not suggest this airline to any frequent travelers. Also, make sure you have locks on your bags or consider not checking any luggage. Do not let the gate agent convince you that a bag needs to be checked because you are allowed one personal item and one carry on.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477karif,Kari F wrote a review Mar 2017,Kari F,"Nairobi, Kenya",2 contributions,2 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r467123740-Fastjet-World.html,Phone Stolen- No action taken by airline,Date of travel: March 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My honeymoon flights from Johannesburg to Zanzibar was cancelled 2 weeks before the planned flight, with no warning. I got an sms saying that my flights were cancelled and that they have been moved to different dates, 5 days after my initial flight plan.
Obviously this is completely unacceptable for a flight to a honeymoon destination. You cannot change your wedding date and cannot change expensive resorts bookings which was made months in advance. My whole honeymoon length and location was based around this low cost flight and I will never make the mistake again to use Fastjet.
I had to buy new flights on another airline for a very large amount, and also depart on a date and time which is not preferred, but the only flights available. I have not received any money back for extra costs incurred from FastJet. Only a refund for the flight which is very cheap so worthless.

Any proper airline has to compensate you for extra cost incurred due to situations which is completely their fault.

"I booked a flight with fastjet in September for late December, and received an email a few days ago advising me that fastjet will no longer be operating flights on the route I'd booked for. They are apparently offering refunds but I'm still waiting on that, but what's most upsetting is a) the short notice I was left with to find an alternate flight, which is more expensive, b) the lack of an explanation as to why the route is cancelled, and c) the lack of any sort of compensation for the inconvenience or assistance with re-arranging my travel plans. I called their customer service line in Uganda and asked to speak to a manager and was told that the managers are at the head office, in another country, and that they're so hard to get ahold of that they don't even answer calls from the staff at the Uganda office!

First was To Nairobi ( Super delay all night long ) next at the KIA (Arusha) the ground personnel actually insults your and asks you to report for there will be no difference.
Then now latest was Mbeya ( not only delayed but the flight was cancelled till the next day) and the ground personnel tells the guests to go back to where they came from today there is no plane till the next day . ( WHAT???)
I bet the Monopoly have made the airline Big headed and customer care to them is below freezing point especially the grounds personnel .
Worst part is that the customer relation telephone given is never picked .

Can so other airline please give us an alternative in Tanzania . Please .

They have a Sky cafe in the plane where the sandwiches served (Sold ) are but a joke.

"We booked 4 flights on Fastjet for a family holiday(with 2 teenagers) to Tanzania and then on to Zanzibar.Out of the 4 flights we only flew Fastjet once, 2 were operated by another airline as they did not have aircraft that day to service the flight and the other they cancelled 15hrs before departure.This cancellation caused us to forfeit $240 in flights with another airline, who required 24 hours notice for a refund, which is understandable.I made a claim for this loss with Fastjet and they just cut and pasted all their T&C's as a response and offered no compensation whatsoever.

"I'm really dissapointed with Fastjet.

For our honeymoon, my husband and I booked a short trip from JHB to Zanzibar, from 18-23th of November. We're both very busy so we cannot take more days of or travel on other days. We booked this months in advance.

Then, last week I got the e-mail from Fastjet announcing that our returnticket has been changed from the 23th to the 20th. At this point, I was already very much disapointed (because: a 2-day honeymoon?! ... If I wanted to go away for just the weekend I would have stayed in SA) but Fastjet said it was the only option and by now, other tickets were already much more expensive so we couldn't afford anything else.

THEN this weekend I got another e-mail, saying the flight had been changed AGAIN. We would now depart on the 27th !!!!!! of November, ONE WEEK LATER! And there was not even a return ticket. This was just impossible for us, so we were forced to cancel the trip.

Unfortunately, because of such a late notice from Fastjet, we cannot cancel the hotel reservations on Zanzibar anymore, which is R3000 lost. Customer Service declined my request for a refund of the money I lost because of THEIR incompetence (which, honestley, is not even close to compensating the DISAPOINTMENT of not having the honeymoon we so much looked forward to).

So I would not recommend Fastjet to anyone; it looks like a good deal but in the end it can cost you a lot more. So please safe yourself the dissapointment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annaaQ3765UK,annaaQ3765UK wrote a review Oct 2016,annaaQ3765UK,"Johannesburg, South Africa",9 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r433217399-Fastjet-World.html,Our flight got changed twice on very short notice so we needed to cancel our honeymoon,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked my wife and I onto a Fastjet flight as part of a 6 week trip around Africa starting in Ethiopia and ending in South Africa.
The main reason being that it was the only company that appears to fly direct between Zanzibar and Jo'burg
Well I say that,but thats when they don't cancel flights!!
I received an email out of the blue from them a couple of days ago providing me
with what was termed as 'an itinerary' update ?
It was a good thing that i looked at it closely as everything was the same as the
original booking confirmation, with the exception that they had changed the flight day
from the 14th December until the 18th December,4 days on !!!
I made two calls to their customer services number in Tanzania(from the UK!) to find out what was going on
After several minutes on each call that was costing plenty, I was cut off !
I finally managed to get a response from an email to their customer services department and I suggested that they might like to arrange to book me and my wife on another carrier on the 14th December,as we were meeting our family arriving from the UK in Jo'burg on the 14th and as such could not wait until the 18th to fly.
I was told that their terms and conditions stated that they are obliged to either
rebook us onto a Fastjet flight 14 days either side of the original date or part/fully
refund the amount paid to them.
I advised them that i was not very happy about that as alternative flights on 14th
December had increased quite considerably since the date I had booked with them
and if I had to re-book one of them then i will be considerably out of pocket.
That made no difference whatsoever they had cancelled my flight and had washed their hands of any responsibility.
Disgusting attitude really!
Having read the last few reviews on TripAdvisor it would seem that this is not a rare
occurrence.It indeed appears to happen very frequently.
So my advice to anyone considering booking with Fastjet is to forget it and take another flight even if this means a stop.
I have also since this happened read some very concerning things about their financial
situation.
So i just hope i get my money back!

"fastjet offers the only direct flight available from ZNZ to JNB. We were traveling to Zanzibar and wanted to continue to Port Elizabeth (over JNB) to do the garden route. Ergo, our entire planning was at the mercy of this flight that they offer twice per week.

Six days before the flight, already on vacation, we were informed that the flight time changed from 8:30 to 18:20. We had to book another connection flight, a hotel for the stay (because we could not continue the same day) and missed a stay in a guesthouse in PLZ.

I sent an inquiry to customer service and I was honestly surprised that they answered: they referred me to their TOS (which says they don't refund anything) and told me that they advise their passengers to use a travel insurance.

The flight itself naturally did not take off on time (it was around 30 min late) and it was not even carried out by fastjet but by a sub-contractor (star airline or similar). A woman sitting next to me payed for seats next to the emergency exit, but was seated somewhere else. The response to her complaint was: ""don't blame us: we are just the subcontractor"".

Also worth a look:
[google for: fastjet delays and cancellations]
Quote: Scheduled flight times may change between publication and the date of departure. fastjet do NOT guarantee flight times.

Essentially, when you book with them, they don't guarantee specific flight times. The only thing they guarantee to you is that you may be able to fly with them (or some subcontractor) at some point in time if they have not gone out of business because of bad customer service by then.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2807PLandrea,Andre A wrote a review Oct 2016,Andre A,"Frankfurt, Germany",8 contributions,10 helpful votes,Zanzibar Island - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r431507270-Fastjet-World.html,travel insurance advised,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We took in total 3 flights with fastjet all of which were at least a couple of hours delayed. Do not expect any communication from staff, at the airport or on the phone. For our last flight they even moved us to a different carrier without informing us. Luckily our schedule was not too tight and we didn't miss any connecting flights. Nevertheless, sitting in front of the check-in desks for hours without aircon is not something you want to do on a holiday (bearing in mind in tanzania you are not allowed to leave the terminal once you have entered - not even from check-in). so if you have a connector flight, little time or just want to avoid this scenario then I would suggest precision airline, they fly to similar destinations and seem cheaper too.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920robertu,robert u wrote a review Oct 2016,robert u,"Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",2 contributions,,Zanzibar Island - Dar es Salaam,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r424672618-Fastjet-World.html,"delayed, no communication - avoid if you have no time to spare",Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was pleasantly surprised by our trips with Fastjet! I had read some mixed reviews but the price of the flights was too good to resist :) We flew from Dar Es Salaam to Zanzibar and then Dar to Kilimanjaro. Both times the plane was quite new and very comfortable. Snacks and drinks were available for purchase but our flights were so short we didn't bother. Both flights left on time and staff were professional and friendly.

One issue was our flight didn't show on the board at Dar airport, so we had to ask around and ended up at the wrong gate. So make sure you're clear about those details at the airport.

Also on the way to Zanzibar our check in agent was very particular about the weight of our baggage (19kg & 22kg for 20kg limit each). We worked it out and then pre-purchased another bag for the next flight before we flew but it wasn't a problem with that flight so I'm not sure if you need to. Overweight baggage can be charged on check in at USD4 per kg (I believe), and prepurchasing another bag costs USD10. I guess work out if that's worth it for you :)

Overall I would definitely recommend and fly again!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucybD8104DH,lucybD8104DH wrote a review Aug 2016,lucybD8104DH,,30 contributions,6 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Zanzibar Island,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r411318871-Fastjet-World.html,Very good budget option,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"They are a budget airline, which means that you pay for baggage, food and beverages are not served on board (unless you pay for them) and there are no entertainment systems (which is to be as expected for what you pay). With that said, the airplane on both flights I took was clean, well maintained and the staff in the aircraft were polite and professional.

On the ground, my experience was unfortunately a different story. My flight from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam at 7:50 am was cancelled; I did not get their “email notice” as I was on another red eye flight from Canada. As such, I sat in the Nairobi airport from 2:00am until 6:50am waiting to check in for my flight – there was no sign at the fastjet checkin desk to notify of a flight cancellation, so it wasn’t until I went to the ticket counter that I found this out.

Due to this, I missed my connecting flight (also a fast jet flight) from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza. (FYI: When I later read the email, the subject line did not caption ‘urgent itinerary change, or flight cancellation’ which could mislead others to skip over the email; it only said please review your flight itinerary, which happened to show a different departure time... so if you do use this airline, make sure to check your email 24 in advance for confirmation or a cancellation notice).

Regardless of the flight cancellation and missing my connecting flight (because I know these things do happen), my issue with Fast Jet was with the airline’s lack of policy surrounding how to accommodate passengers in these situations and the lack of training for ground staff (i.e. ticket counter) to respond with adequate customer service.

Case in point: Since the next Fast Jet flight we could get on was 14 hours later, myself and a few other passengers requested a food voucher OR access to an airport lounge OR a hotel accommodation so we could eat and rest; I didn’t care what they were able to provide, I just did not want to sit at the terminal for 14 hours. As a frequent traveler, I know this is standard procedure for other airlines to accommodate passengers when they make a significant itinerary change -- after all, it wasn’t our fault they cancelled our flight.

The girl at the ticket booth resisted at first, stating it was our fault we did not see the email they sent notifying us to come later. It took 4 hours of going back and forth to figure out how to proceed…during this time, I had to get behind the desk to use her laptop so I could browse alternative flight options and prices for her. They decided that booking us a sooner flight out on another airline was too expensive, so eventually they did book us a hotel in Nairobi with transport (and I honestly sincerely appreciate this!!! It was a really nice hotel with lunch included)…but it took 4 hours of negotiation and 1 hour of waiting for the taxi to get to this point. By the time I got to the hotel, I only had a few hours to sleep before we got picked up again to go back.

The girl at the ticket desk had also informed me that the best plan to get my connecting flight to Mwanza re-booked would be to arrive in Dar es Salaam and go to their ticket counter. She explained that since it departed from Dar, it needed to be reissued from Dar; she also said this office was open 24 hours.

Not surprisingly, I flew into Dar at 11:30pm and the ticket office was closed. I sat on the floor of the airport until 4:00am when the Fast Jet Ticket office opened - the lady there informed me she could not reissue my ticket and I would need to purchase another one. I was trying to explain my situation so she could understand that it was not my fault I missed my connecting flight and in fact it was Fast Jet’s cancellation that caused me to miss it, but she began to yell at me.

Thankfully she sent me to talk to another woman from Swissport (Fast Jet’s ground service representatives) and she issued me another ticket (free of charge) without a second thought. The staff at the FastJet checkin and baggage drop off (who were also Swissport staff as per their uniforms) were polite and efficient; I was able to get on board the next flight without issues after this and as mentioned earlier, the flight experience was good.

I am not sure why there is such a drastic difference of conduct with the ticket counter staff, but it seems the lack of clear policy in these situations has caused no continuity of customer service on the ground. Although I am very appreciative that I had received the hotel accommodation while in Nairobi, I must admit I was disappointed that it took 5 hours to access. I was also troubled by how I was given incorrect information regarding my layover in Dar and how poorly I was treated by Dar’s ticket office agent, especially when she could see I was tired and upset. Because of this, I will probably not use Fast Jet again.

I would not recommend this airline to you if you have a connecting flight. I would only recommend Fast Jet if you are flexible with your travel plans and willing to chance that your flight could be cancelled for an extended period of time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/98/9b/6d/steph-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephH358,Stephanie wrote a review Jul 2016,Stephanie,"London, Canada",28 contributions,14 helpful votes,Nairobi - Mwanza,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r392815840-Fastjet-World.html,Use with Caution:,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We arrived late to DAR on Turkish, only to miss our flight on Precision Air (when the check-in desk closed 45 minutes before the flight).  We were directed to FastJet, and they were more than happy to accommodate us (requiring us to purchase NEW tickets).  We were happy they had seats, and we agreed to pay the $185/person so that we were not stranded.  However, when we handed them the credit card, they informed us they required cash.  We began digging through bags to find enough cash, and just made it.  They then handed back 2 $20 bills, stating that they all had to be dated after 2006.  Luckily, we were able to find enough money to cover it.  Other than that, which was stressful, FastJet was lovely.  The flight boarding was organized, plane was clean, staff was friendly, and baggage delivered in a timely fashion.  Overall, in the future, I will book FastJet to start with (hopefully using a credit card online!).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/02/94/ca/beth-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962bethb,Beth B wrote a review Jul 2016,Beth B,"Palo Alto, California",48 contributions,46 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Mwanza,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r389232852-Fastjet-World.html,Excellent flight; required cash!,Date of travel: June 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight was delayed by 2 hours of which no one told us anything about.

When we called the call centre they were not even aware of any delay nor that their airline is not showing on the airline details screens.
We were told to take small airlines which will take us to Dar es salaam where when we arrived we had to re-book our flights as all(all passengers) our details were not reflecting on the system.

"Fantastic on-board service from a budget airline. As with budget airlines around the world, you get what you pay for, ie getting to your destination. Extras were reasonably priced, even a checked in bag when booked online. The only comment would be for ground staff to have better systems in place for processing passengers for check-in. I flew Johannesburg-Harare-Victoria Falls-Johannesburg. The check in at Johannesburg was chaotic and the staff arrived late for the check in. Harare was a little better at more organised and Victoria Falls better still.

"My flight to Kilimanjaro from Entebbe was delayed by 2 hours on the 16 th of January 2016 and the return flight on the 19th January was cancelled and moved to the 21st of which i was suppose to be back in UK .That meant i had to fork out more money to buy another ticket with a different airline to get me back to Entebbe on time for my next flight.

However .i emailed their customer services ,unfortunately i never got a response so i had to make an expensive phone call to demand my money back.The lovely lady was quick to apologise and assured me action would be taken to get my money back.Its now more than two weeks ,no explanation or communication and no refund .......yet.Iam guessing i will have to make another phone call to chase them.

That was my first and last to use this airline,obviously it is cheap in some way but very expensive in case of a cancellation.Infact when i saw an out of date magazine on their flight i smelt a very stinky rat,April 2014 to January 2016 ummm surely a tell tale sign.

Fastjet is the most reliable airline in Tanzania. They prefer to call themselves budget airline but I do not think so. There are so many hidden cost that will make you pay just a little cheaper than other airlines. Their service is very professional on the ground and on board. Their always on time (sometimes arriving earlier than indicated time) which is a big plus to me.
