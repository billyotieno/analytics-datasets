"The Johannesburg-Cape Town route is the busiest in South Africa and I believe in Africa as a whole. Several South African low-cost airlines operate on the route. This, in turn, lowered prices to a completely acceptable level. Having an extremely sad experience with AirLink, I chose this South African low-cost airline with brightly colored planes. This is a kind of South African Ryanair, but somewhat more expensive (maybe because I took tickets on the day of departure). There is no food, no drinks either. I didn't see any heartbreaking scenes with luggage in calibrators either. Maybe lucky? But they flew out on time, they arrived too.

"Good day. I am writing this email whilst sitting at King Shaka Airport - Durban. Utterly disgraceful and humiliating service from all staff members of FlySafair at boarding gate NAMELY - VALENCIA. This is Mohamed. I was taking the 21:40pm flight from Dur - Jnb (OR TAMBO) and i checked in online 24 hours before. I received my seat number and boarding pass via email and was clearly aware that the boarding gate closes 15 minutes prior which was 21:25pm. I was coming from Umhlanga and there was construction on the road - altought there was major traffic and delays - i knew i checked in online and just had to get to the boarding gate. I arrive inside the airport at 21:20 and i was boarding at gate A14 which was a 30 second run from the security gate. I knew i had a minute or two so i ran along with my sister who was travelling with me and reached in under 30 seconds which means i was there at 21:25 on the dot. Infront of me was the staff named Valencia (an african lady) who was escorting a standby passenger into the boarding gate and i was probably roughly around 2-3 feet behind her. She clearly heard me running yet walked into the gate and shut the door. I pleaded to her that i was right here at 21:25 on the dot and that i was just behind her so why cannot i be let in. She told me they have already taken standby passengers so i informed her how can you take standby passengers when booked passengers like my sister and i - are already here and on top of it all , we are ON TIME / JUST ON TIME. It does not make any sense. She continued to revoke me and i raised my voice because this was the last flight of the night , it was a SUNDAY and i have work the next day in JNB. She used language words on me such as “JWAYELANI” and since i am brought up in KZN , i clearly know the meaning of it and this is disgraceful that safair can have crew of this nature working for them. I wrote my matric final exams 5 years ago and on my final paper i was on the last question and the government examiner noticed this and gave me 2 more minutes to complete my paper. But this is not the case because i was JUST ON TIME. I am stating this because if even i was a minute or 2 late - this is not acceptable that situations cannot be understoof. If i was there 5-10 minutes after gate closed and planes doors are closed - that is a different situation. By taking standby passengers it means they are still processing passenger and that the plane door is still open. How were standby passengers already being processed at 21:25 when the boarding gates just closed and we were there. The only difference was they were taken inside but not us. This is not justifiable at all that i have to miss opening my business and loose my customers of the day because Valencia AND TEAM was so negligent in doing their part and understanding that i am on time and i am here so how can preference be given to a standby customer. A short indian lady from the boarding gate came to explain to me why they not allowing me and that im late took 5-7 minutes to explain and justify herself when she can take 15 seconds and process both my sister and i. This is disgraceful and i had to pay R300 for me and R300 for my sister to be put at a 6:15am flight as a STANDBY. Which means at this point writing this email i do not even know if i will get on the flight and make it on time because i still have to travel 200km from JNB airport to my home in North West. I WANT VIDEO FOOTAGE AND SURVEILLANCE AS I CLEARLY SAW A CAMERA ALL OVER THE PLACE TO BE SEEN THAT I WAS THERE ON TIME WITH MY SISTER. AND ALSO THE LEVEL OF TREATMENT THAT WE WERE GIVEN. If you want to continue being my trusted airline provider , i want a full refund and to be compensated for my loss of income for the day that i will be running arround for standby flights and not have my business opened due to lack of mentality of staff of FlySafair. This is non-negotiable and i will take this further up if necessary. This is a money making scheme as those people have now paid for our seats and you made douboe the money. And to top it all you charge is R300 for nothing. We are only forced to pay because this matter cannot be handled in-house and needs to be taken up via email. And we need to get home. I trust we can come to an understanding and that flysafair can understand and view evidence as evidence is clearly available as to what time we arrived at the gate. I will not let this matter rest. I look forward to an urgent response from the team of FlySafair.

We had a connecting flight delay from Cape Town on Safair. Had to catch the international Safair flight to Mauritius. The Assistants at the check-in counters refused to allow us to drop off our luggage 43 minutes prior to the flight scheduled to take off. We had already done an Online check-in. Safair failed to acknowledge the delay on the first flight was due to them.
We were not reimbursed for the flight.

Also the check in was in the domestic terminal B and not in the International TerminAl A which was very confusing.

"Having travelled regularly for years both in economy class and business class, my wife and I would only spend the extra money to 1) have more convenience and comfort in a rush 2)  to get rest having travelled a lot or when flying one route that is part of a much longer and tiring travel journey and 3) on very special occasions. We recently booked business class with safair for a combination of these reasons and were utterly disappointed. Travelling on FA 286 on the 19th August from ORT to King Shaka and on FA 283 on the 21st August for the return route: some staff were rude, unhelpful, offensive, and apparently ignorant of the service offering. There were zero benefits gained for the extra fees other than the front row seat - which is no big deal as it does not even have place to put small items when in travel.  The waste of money is the big issue but this could all have been avoided if 1) Safair don't pretend to offer a business class service when they cant fulfill on that or 2) Safair simply offered economy class only and manage expectations accordingly.

Even with adequate weight and amount of bags, the check-in team, headed by Mr. Emanuel (Supposed check-in supervisor) was extremely rude, ill-prepared, arrogant, unprofessional and even threatening.

the company should review the employees.

"We had to fly from CPT to Joburg, and then catch a connecting flight to Mauritius. My brother and I both have the same initials, so I accidentally grabbed his passport instead of mine.. Chandre, an amazing staff member of Flysafair ensured that we would not miss our flight to Mauritius by organising for the next flight to Joburg to bring my passport (which my dad dropped off for me).

"Good day



I booked a flight with the details per the subject line for myself: FLIGHT- 20 JUNE 2022- 8.05PM- REF: UEWON4



The flight boarded just after 8pm. After about 20 minutes of boarding and no departure, the captain announced that there was a technical issue with the aircraft and that the engineers are working on it and we should be ready to go within 15 minutes.

An hour had then passed and there was still no take off. The captain then announced that it would be another 15 minutes and it was a small issue with the aircons only and once filters were changed, the plane would be good to go.

After 2 hours stuck on the plane, crew allowing no one off (holding us like hostages) on a plane filled to capacity of nearly 150 people with no aircons on (under covid circumstances), we requested waters from the cabin crew, who simply ignored our numerous requests.



After the 2 hours stuck on the plane, the captain announced that the flight was ready to go and the engineers signed off the paperwork.

On departure, whilst on the runway, it was simply clear to the passengers that the plane was not receiving enough power to basically take off the run way. Any normal person could tell this. The pilot however, at his own discretion ( or advice from SAFair) decided to fly the aircraft anyway, knowing the risks.



As a frequent flyer, I am fully aware, as are others, at the rate that an aircraft it suppose to gain altitude etc.

However, 10 minutes into the flight, the plane was cruising at a really low altitude, where peoples houses, cars and road ways were still clearly visible from the aircraft. This was already a concern as it was quite noticeable that the aircraft was no longer ascending/gaining further altitude.



The Pilot then called cabin crew to the cockpit which was clearly an emergency. Passengers were now aware that there was an issue.



The Pilot announced about 15 minutes into the flight that there was another technical issue with the aircraft and that it was not gaining pressure and that if we continued with the flight, we would not make it to the destination (JHB to Durban) as we would run out of fuel.

A few minutes later, he announced that we would need to make an emergency landing that would occur within 5 minutes, that all passengers must take the brace position and follow the crews instruction to disembark one the aircraft was grounded.



This caused distress amongst the passengers as the aircraft was not near any safe landing spots.



The pilot , somehow, managed to get the aircraft back to OR Tambo and thankfully landed the plane safely.



There was no need to cause such panic and distress to passengers.



Upon landing, again, a considerable period of time passed and they did not allow anyone off the aircraft, let alone offer a bottle of water…knowing that there are children and elderly people on the flight. No communication was put forward to advise passengers of what was happening.



Once they eventually let everyone off the plane, around 11pm, they loaded the 150 odd people on merely 2 busses at the airport (again, under covid circumstances and locked the bus doors) and held us on the bus for nearly an hour, with no communication to the passengers once again.



They eventually advised just after 11pm that they have arranged an alternative plane. At this point, after the trauma and considering the time of night, many passengers, including myself refused to get onto another flight after the traumatic experience caused by the pure blatant negligence of the Fly SAfair crew and pilot. They decided to risk peoples lives knowingly!



There was no one for loved ones to contact in an emergency situation at FLY SAfair, not at the call center nor at the service desks at the airport.



When I called Fly SAfair on 22/06/2022 at around 9.20am and requested a refund, they advised that since “we got onto the flight, they would not refund the money” and Keven Scheepers confirmed that “it was not that bad.” Again, pure disregard for people, the trauma caused by the airline, and the inconvenience caused by them, let alone the risk that they placed peoples lives in. I requested to speak to a manager and was advised that a Thuli would contact me “WHEN SHE HAS TIME”, a call that I still await.



I would advise anyone looking to use this airline not to do so. They have complete disregard for safety. The crew, pilots, call center agents are all of no assistance whatsoever! This situation could have been avoided as it was clear as day that the aircraft was not safe to fly, yet they took the chance.



Hope this helps someone when deciding to use this airline!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saeomaj,Saeoma Duttoo wrote a review Jun 2022,Saeoma Duttoo,,1 contribution,4 helpful votes,Lanseria - Durban,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r843978679-FlySafair-World.html,DISREGARD FOR SAFETY BY FLYSAFAIR,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On Sunday 19 June 2022, my family arrived to check in at the airport (the online check in was not working). We arrived over an hour prior to our flight only to be made to stand in the check-in queue for approx 45 minutes while they helped on customer in front of us for that entire duration. We got to the front of the queue only to be told that our flight was full. When we enquired about how that was possible and why we were sold tickets in a full flight we were simply told that we should have arrived at the airport earlier (which makes absolutely no sense as to why our flight was over booked). We were then told to pay an extra R300 each in order to be booked on a later flight which would leave at 17:50 (so we had to wait from morning until 17:50 to see if we could get on that flight). When the time finally came, only one seat was available on that flight and the remaining people had to take the next morning's flight. It is completely unethical that Flysafair allowed my family to buy tickets on a full flight because had they been honest with their customers that flights were full alternative travel arrangements could have been made. They refused to give a refund under the guise of their policy that one is to arrive 1 hour 30 minutes before the flight time. The representatives had no remorse. We quickly discovered while waiting at the airport that we were not the only ones left destitute at the airport under similar circumstances by the airline. I would never recommend them nor use them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onka13,Onka wrote a review Jun 2022,Onka,,1 contribution,,Durban - Lanseria,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r843874387-FlySafair-World.html,Mrs,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

After a very long day travelling we boarded a Safair fight to Cape Town with renewed energy and enthusiasm as it was the first time using the airline and we were excited to get home.  The flight was jam-packed with no room to move or breathe and while we were all fanning ourselves the air hostess said she could not make the cabin cooler because others would complain.  It was ridiculously hot and everyone was complaining.  A two hour flight that felt like eternity.

"A huge thank you to the flight attendants on Flight FA851 . My mother-in-law fell ill and they handled the situation with absolute efficiency and style. They gently moved her to the back of the plan and ensured that she was well taken care off as best they could. I would have loved to give a 5* for the airline, but on our trip to Mauritius, on Flight number FA 850 , both my hubby's and my perfume bottles were stolen from our locked bags. Then it was extremely inefficient of some staff members to request that 3/4 of the people on the plan fill out the all in one form to Land in Mauritius at the check in gates - that ate up so much time and that was all in vain as forms needed to be refilled once we landed in Mauritius.

"Took a flight from Durban to Cape Town at 19:30 on 06/03/2022. The pilot announced (20-30min before landing) that some of the bags had to be left behind due to weight restrictions which was upsetting cos Safair asks you to Pay for luggage that is checked in....

We disembarked and got to the baggage counters cos no one knew whose bag was left behind... we stood in queues after 10pm on a Sunday night to fill forms and were promised our bags will arrive the next morning and be delivered to our homes. It is now 2pm on 07/03/2022 - I spent the entire morning trying to get through to Safair, only to be told now that my bag IS STILL IN DURBAN! I checked in my luggage with food/frozen items... I spent alot of money to buy these things and every single item will now need to be thrown away because of Safair and their lack of communication. If this was mentioned to me earlier, I would never have even checked in a bag. And I paid 155 rand for this bag to be checked in, in addition of monies spent on the items packed inside the bag... who will reimburse me for this?? Cos Safair isnt communicating with me... even the agent doesnt know what is happening.... They just set me back on money I do not have to waste. And time I will never get back. I started my Monday with pure exhaustion and frustration all thanks to this airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeannnaidoo123,Lee wrote a review Mar 2022,Lee,,1 contribution,,Durban - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r830365125-FlySafair-World.html,"Poor communication and Complete disrespect of Passengers, Their money and Time",Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight was perfect and absolutely no issues on that front- crew were great. But, and it is a very big But... The customer service back office experience as abysmal, and also the webpage for managing bookings really needs modernising. I tried 3 different payment methods with various working payment cards, zapper etc and none worked no matter what I tried due to some very unusual card authorization on the website. Also tried different browsers. Eventually 2 days later I got hold of customer service who processed it manually but chose the wrong booking dates so I had to amend myself which fortunately I could on the website. Another 2 days later I was then charged twice for the same booking. It then took me about 4 weeks and 20 emails to have to prove to them this had happened and get a refund...

"We flew from Joburg to Cape Town and back using the Lift airline. We were incredibly happy with our entire flight. Check in going to Cape Town was smooth, we were actually a little late for boarding as the passengers boarded a little quicker than we 'time budgeted' for. The flight was smooth and bathrooms were in great conditions (even had a little flower in a vase on the basin, which is a cute touch). The flight included a complementary in-flight service where you could have something to drink and something small to nibble on. The flight attendants were friendly and accommodating and the pilots on both flights flew smoothly. The only thing that wasn't great was when checking-in bags on the flight back to Joburg. We waited about 45 minutes for check-in of bags to open. We were on time but the airline was late, so we had to rush dinner before boarding. We did contact the airline and I got a call even before we flew to ask if everything was okay and how the could help, so customer service is excellent.

"I tried to make changes to a return flight booking 5hrs before departure where departing flight was already checked in. I could only change the return flight. No message informed me that the only way to change the departing flight is to call the call center.

However, if you make a change to a single flight booking where you have checked into , a large red message does appear informing you to contact the support center

This design is inconsistent and confusing to users.

I contacted the call center a week afterwards to hear their response and was told that I should have realized I needed to contact the call center as only one flight was changeable. Hence no in app message required

"DO NOT TRAVEL on this airline unless you want to find yourself out of pocket for your valuable luggage and stressed out at the end of a holiday. They will return your luggage damaged, and then wipe their hands of the situation by sending you an email saying what happens to the baggage is out of their control because it has to -- and I quote directly the nonsense they sent me -- ""pass through the hands of several service providers in the airport context.""

Particularly don't recommend them if you are travelling with children (in my case, two small children) -- they damaged my child's car seat so as to make it completely unuseable. They literally damaged the one part that says DO NOT REMOVE. They then said I could no longer make a claim once I had stepped out of the airport. No, you did not read that wrong -- apparently after a long flight (that didn't leave on time), you are expected to then traipse around a large airport and track down their lost luggage office which is nowhere to be found, while dragging along two small, tired children, in order for them to believe you're not making this up (who has the time?!?) and yes, they really did damage your toddler seat. As any parent knows, it's already stressful travelling with children, and FlySafair will only make it worse.

They claim reporting directly at their (invisible) lost luggage office is for ""transparency"" reasons, when actually transparency on their part would have been them telling you they can't be trusted to safely check in a car seat. I specifically asked this both when booking and at the check in and was told it would be absolutely fine.

There are other airlines that are just as cheap, so FlySafair don't offer anything special unless you consider the stress of damaged luggage special.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaMark2,Monica M wrote a review Jan 2022,Monica M,,1 contribution,,Johannesburg - East London,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r825270549-FlySafair-World.html,DO NOT TRAVEL THIS AIRLINE,Date of travel: January 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On the 22nd, we wanted to book flights from ELS to JHB for 5 people. (Myself, my bf, my bro and his friends). We initially used 1 computer to book for us 5 and per person it ended being OVER +-R100 which DOESN""T MAKE SENSE. So we ended up using 2 laptops to book (2 adults and 3 adults separately) and paid extra +-R300 for my bro and his friends.

Yes, it was my bro's fault for not checking the email confirmation within an hour after receiving it but because my bro has an account with Flysafair and hes been a loyal to the brand, he thought everything was in order until... he checked his email the day after around 1am which rolled over to the next day (today). So when I called the customer service agent, P**tia was assisting me over the phone. When I explained the situation that there was a system error, (me and my bf are on the 17:55 flight, my bro and his party 09:25 flight) as my bro and his party were supposed to be on the 17:55 with us but somehow him and his party got put on the 09:25 flight (We have screenshots of the booking summary stating this), P**tia cut me off and started EACH sentence with, ""Unfortunately...."" she INTERRUPTED me while I was explaining and ALL she said was, ""Unfortunately..."" like a robot with NO HUMAN FEELINGS. As if ALL Flysafair agents are trained like a robot. She didnt let me finish and I got angry and asked her to let me finish speaking. I was livid at this point as I had to keep repeating only for her to ""unfortunately"" me without even listening to the entire thing!!!!

I must say, I did apologize to her first for raising my voice as I was frustrated with, ""unfortunately"" and getting cut off middle sentence and she DID NOT ONCE apologize. She even put me on loud speaker for her colleagues to listen and was talking to her colleagues whilst I was explaining. I mean,.... WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS????!

We acknowledge that we didnt check the email immediately, I asked her if there was anything that she can advise us to do. She didnt want to listen and kept saying, ""Unfortunately you have to pay the flight difference and penalty fee."" So for the 3 of them, Flysafair wanted to charge R1500. I explained again, when you book for people over 2, they will charge you EXTRA +-R100 per person and P**tia replied with, ""it is possible..."" I told her, "" No, its not possible, it is a fact! I can show you the confirmation you charge MORE for doing 1 transaction if the number of passengers are more than 2""

Anyway, I eventually said ok to the penalty fee of R300pp but asked if she could waive the flight ticket difference and she said AGAIN, ""Unfortunately"" ...

I am UTTERLY disgusted with the lack of compassion P**tia has, I dont know if all other Flysafair agents are like this or just her. I feel INJUSTICE!!

"I am UTTERLY infuriated by the fact that money was STOLEN out of my husband's bank account after trying to VIEW a ticket with the airline FlySafair using the eDreams advertisement while searching for tickets on the 24th of November 2021.
I am absolutely disgusted at the complete lack of service with eDreams, the fact that they have made to attempt to respond to my 10 attempts at contact to request my refund. FlySafair has only offered me a voucher for a ticket and has not provided me with a way to contact a HUMAN BEING who works at this travel agency. I despise using eDreams hence why I CANCELLED the purchase over 5 times! I DID NOT approve it on the FNB app and I did NOT enter the OTP required to complete the purchase. I was not even sent a confirmation of purchase. I IMMEDIATELY contacted the airline who assured me that the payment was not processed and that the money would be re4turned to my husband's account. THIS WAS NOT WHAT TOOK PLACE because the payment was successfully processed by eDreams and RECIEVED by FlySafair after I was assured that this would not be the case. Now, THREE weeks later after submitting countless requests with the bank, airline and travel agency I sit R1726 less than what is owed to me. Who can I contact to resolve this issue before I result to a lawsuit????

We had to return to the terminal building with no communication about what was going on.

"Flysafair boasts of their efficiency when things go well. But service levels are judged when matters go wrong.

My flight was delayed from 15h40 until 21h30!
Flysafair staff deserted the passengers and left us without any information! No apologies! No decency and no compensation!

"My parents booked a flight for the 22nd of September to George, they were at the airport 90 minutes before the time and they missed the flight with several other people because Flysafair has one place the passengers can go through and nobody helps the customers.

Today, the 23rd of Sept, my parents were put on standby, they were there again one and a half hours before the time and nobody is at the customer care desk... At this very moment, +- 25 people have missed their morning flight because there was nobody at flysafair and still no one now ar customer care... my parents also sitting there even though they were at the airport an hour an a half before the flight..

I swear this is some kind of fraud scheme... how do 25 people miss their flight... nobody has even been seen at the kulula customer care desk or at the cemair customer care desk...

FlySafair are encouraging people who have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 to act recklessly and endanger all other passengers on the flight.  You are given the option to cancel flights with a charge of R300 per flight (so R600 if you've booked a return) and the remainder is credited to a FlySafair voucher that is valid for 12 months.

After many months waiting and complaining with Flysafair they said they sent me the money to my bank account (in Brazil), however in the confirmation my name was spelled wrong. Flysafair said that even with this typo in my name the refund went through, which is hard to believe. There is no sign of the refund in my account or credit card.

"Durban-Cape Town and return.  My understanding is that Safair is a no-frills airline and that's what we got.  Check-in online was available 24 hours prior to departure.  Bag check at Durban was efficient, although there was a long queue because several flights were leaving with an hour of one another.  Plane departed on time and arrived in CT on time. There was no cabin service of any kind.  Boarding and deplaning happened both through the front and back of the aircraft, 2 rows at a time.  Bag carousel where our bags could be collected was SMSed to my phone and were quickly delivered without damage.  Return flight experience was much the same. I used vouchers from a previously cancelled trip to purchase the tickets via Safair's website and the purchase went through without any problems at all.  We arrived at the CT airport 2 hours before departure and checked our bags.  Plane left a few minutes early and arrived in Durban 20 minutes ahead of schedule.  Again, no cabin service enroute.  All in all, a pleasant, efficient experience.  We'll ride with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/punchbuggy_winnah,punchbuggy_winnah wrote a review Aug 2021,punchbuggy_winnah,"Durban, South Africa",33 contributions,31 helpful votes,Durban - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r801338372-FlySafair-World.html,"Well-run, No-frills Experience",Date of travel: July 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight due to depart June 26 and everyone knew the president would adjust the travel policy, Safair being the exception it seems!
We cancelled our leisure flight but were charged change fees when a day later we would not have been allowed to travel anyway and our flight would have been cancelled - with two young kids and being older parents, if we had flown that would have been irresponsible.
Been phoning/emailing with them since that date with no joy as they stick to their guns, fees apply of R300 per person which is 30-40% of the total flight cost one way.

"FLIGHT FA - 414A friend of mine flew into South Africa this morning and she needed her mom and I to assist her with traveling back to Durban with her 9month old triplet boys. Safair rules don’t allow for an infant unaccompanied by an adult.  One of her babies have a heart condition and is quite fragile-he remains strapped to her while they travelled for safety. The other two babies were in highly recommended special car seats strapped to a carseat trolley. When we got to the door of the aircraft they greeted us with “Those baby seats are not allowed on this plane, they have to go into the luggage compartment”, there was NO “Good morning ma’am how can we help, we would just like to inform you that the baby seats are not allowed to go onto this aircraft, but lets quickly get you settled in and then those baby seats could be moved to the luggage compartment.  So my friend(the mother of the triplets) said we just quickly want to take them into the aircraft and get settled and then the baby seats can be moved to the luggage compartment. Again the cabin crew insisted that we need to remove the babies from the chair by the door, my friend then pleaded and said we have our hands full we aren’t able to carry the babies in in our arms because our hands are full. This specific air hostess then turns to me(who was holding the nappy bags, our jackets, 6 boarding passes and 6 Passports) and said do you want to tell me you can’t hold a baby? Firstly if she did what she was getting paid to do, she would be a little more helpful and less sarcastic....otherwise why even have cabin crew Safair.  What does their job entail??We were then informed that we had to switch our phones to airplane mode.  Which we happily did.When the aircraft started taking off - the passenger in 2E’s cellphone started ringing.  It stopped ringing.  Then it started ringing again. And it went on like this for the entire take off until the aircraft was in the air.  The cabin crew who EASILY told us what to do and how to do it with a sarcastic tone in their voices could not address the passenger in 2E and ask him to switch his phone to airplane mode—NO SHE SAT in her seat and just watched him do his own thing.  The other passengers had to tell him to switch his phone to airplane mode to avoid interference with the flight. Not sure if he actually ended up doing it. But what was extremely frustrating was that the air hostesses(cabin crew) weren’t being helpful in any way with us, they could easily address us but wouldn’t address other passengers who WERENT traveling with babies. We added priority boarding to our flight package to ensure that we were settled before the other passengers entered, so we didn’t hold up anyone. When it was finally time to unfastened our seat belts for landing the air hostesses told us that we can move out and they’ll bring our carry on luggage. By this time of the flight majority of the surrounding passengers were polite, friendly and understanding knowing of the little one out of the three’s heart condition (including the air hostesses) As soon as the aircraft stopped my friend(seated in 2C)got up to put her baby strap back onto her abdomen in order to put her little fragile baby back into it. So the passenger in 2E gets up and tried to push passed her in order to leave and nearly knocked over my friend and her baby into the aisle(who she was holding and trying to strap back into his carry on)her and her baby could have been seriously injured—my friend then turned around flustered/tired and fought with this passenger saying could he just be a little more considerate he can see that she is busy strapping in her baby to secure him. The air hostesses were at the time laughing with one of the passengers in front of them, instead of ensuring that the passengers were leaving in an orderly fashion. The air hostesses saw what was happening but didn’t say a word to this same passenger.  When my friend turned to tell the passenger that he was being inconsiderate—the one air hostess next to me in the aisle (seated right behind my friend in 3D) laughed at the situation——what the hell???? Is it not her job to sort out passengers that behave in this manor?????? Is it not their job to ensure safe/comfortable disembarking for Safair passengers????? They were unprofessional and useless.  I was so disgusted with the service we received today right from the check-in counter to boarding and to then flying.   We received terrible service and I will NEVER book with Safair again.

"I had a flight booked that was delayed six hours without ANY communication from the airline. I couldn't believe safair didn't communicate any changes of arrangements for their customers desperately trying to get home. Despite the confusing, stressful and difficult task of trying to navigate my way between missing luggage and impossible timing, I had to get to another airport to catch a later flight. The lack of communication from Safair was deafening. Did I not receive my boarding pass via whatsapp? Could they not have notified me of anuy delays (6Hours!)and subsequent changes to my arrangements to get home safely? I was very disappointed. (Safair found fault with the initial flight.  Which was fine, as I appreciate the safety checks on the planes before boarding.) Then I overheard (coincidentally) safiar would send another plane. This plane was ALSO not able to board for some reason. Why did they not COMMUNICATE the issue with the passangers? According to AJ which I had a long conversation with over Facebook Messanger, they accommodated passangers. They had ten seats  available on the 'alternative arrangement flight'. So, in theory, they had made arrangements for only ten passangers. Not acceptable.  I would have been happy If Safair had simply let us KNOW what was going on.

"I had opted to utilize Flysafair this year in celebration of my daughters birthday. Had booked tickets in April of last year but due to Covid we could not make use of it. We then opted to utilize our tickets this year May and flight rebooking was done in March 2021.
We arrived at airport early, did online check in as not to waste any valuable time and waited for our flight departing at 13:45 on Friday 21/05.
We arrived at gate at 13:34 and at that point are told that boarding has closed.
Staff were still at gate and in the attempt to ask them to please allow us in, they state that gates close at 13:35 (during the attempt to get them to let us in, it was now 13:36).
Complete refusal to allow us in however it took another 15 to 20min for airline to remove our luggage from flight.

We were then forced to
1. Pay R2000 more for a later flight at 19:30
Now Plse note that we witnessed first hand at the 19:30 flight that your boarding commenced earlier than stipulated and that your staff took it upon themselves to stand behind “last passenger” to begin closing boarding. At that point we stepped into line to join boarding so it’s clear that your staff is beginning boarding earlier and closing boarding earlier.
However surprisingly, we sit in plan and it 19:20 and passengers are still being let in...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR 15min gates closed rule then???????
Showing not all staff are adopting the same company policies and practices.

We than left to CT, had a wonderful 2 night stay but the dreaded Flysafair had a rear it’s ugly head once again on our depart.
I had booked one bag for check in and that one one bag and one carry over was brought in to Ct from Dbn however on our return back to dbn we are told carry on is far too big and we would need to pay R250 for the bag.
Now I would not have created a fuss had this policy been applied from dbn to ct as it would have been made aware to me then that this was company policy wrt size, however at your next branch I’m told something different and asked to dish out more hard earned money.
To make things worse, we see hoards of bags on our entry to plane kept aside and tagged as “too large” but those individuals were not asked to shell out R250 extra
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR RULE wrt carry on luggage.
Showing once again not all staff follow the same company policies and rules

Now it’s extremely disappointing that a family hold us after 1.5years of not flying had to begin and end so disgustingly courtesy of Flysafair.
Your costumer service leaves much to be desired for. Your staff are poorly trained and are clearly doing as they please

Also note, NO ANNOUNCEMENTS WRT BOARDING at King Shaka. We were told by your staff that there are signs everywhere notifying passengers of it being a “silent airport”. I did not see one such sign.

Unfortunately the 2 flying experiences with Flysafair were enough and I will make every attempt to avoid flying your airline",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashPadayachee_,Tash Padayachee wrote a review May 2021,Tash Padayachee,,6 contributions,,Durban - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r789628046-FlySafair-World.html,Terrible service,Date of travel: May 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flysafair was my favourite airline until service recommenced after lock down. I travel to and from Cape Town twice a month. The vast majority of  bookings made by me since flights recommenced have been unilaterally changed by the airline. I choose my flights carefully and I choose my seat (and pay for the privilege) carefully. Both are  changed without any reference to me until after the event.

"When we flew from Jhb to Dbn, we had one checked bag. When we arrived in Dbn, when we collected the suitcase from the carousel, the handle of the suitcase (the part that you pull the bag on to make it go on it’s wheels) was broken off, and there was a tear in the material on the front of the bag. It made moving through the airport very difficult, as we now had to carry such a heavy suitcase because there was no handle to pull it on it’s wheels. I have sent many emails to Flysafair, but they seem unwilling to respond - very much like their ground staff at the airport basically ignored me when I reported the broken bag.

"My boyfriend and I had separate bookings to fly later today but our flight was moved to a later time. We received the email to confirm this. In our experience (even though the airline will deny it) We tried to check-in or add baggage to our existing flight and we unknowingly canceled our flight by licking back or apparently clicking ""get voucher"" which we did not click on ( even though the assistants claim this is impossible). Even if we did select get a voucher there were only 2 boxes to check either change flight or get a voucher. Apparently, we selected to get a voucher but the flight had to charge us a R300 admin fee because it was the government's fault for changing the flight and not theirs. WHAT RUBBISH!

So now I ended up paying R577 extra for a flight I already paid R1288 for !!!! Because they deducted the R300 admin fee and then when I went to rebook my flight it kicked me out of the system saying it was sold out but when I retried the price increased and was suddenly available.

What a useless website! I would understand if one of us made the mistake of clicking the wrong button but for both of us to click the wrong button I find it impossible. They should also have underneath the get voucher option that it is R300 extra!!! Im fuming mad.

I was told at the Flysafair kiosk at OR Thambo that I should have arrived earlier to be put on an earlier flight. How was I supposed to know that??????
I do not want vouchers from Safair because I did not pay you in vouchers, I paid with cash. I want my money back from you. I booked another flight on Lift so that I could get to my family. Who is going to refund that?

"This was my first time traveling with you guys.
It started out good, with 2 people standing ready with sanitizers to spray us and reminding everyone to stick to the social distancing dotes on the floor as we were boarding. I was very amped with my window seat (32F) and very happy as it was also on the second last row at the back of the plane which meant I’ll be one of the first guys out when the back door opens when we get to disembark to avoid the crowds with this whole covid thing!
Passenger 32D arrived and then 32E! Yes ! 3 strangers in a 3 seater row! The intercoms announcing a reminder to please maintain 1.5m safe distancing between you and your fellow travelers as much as possible which is protocol obviously. But they place 3 single travelers in 1 row with NO social distancing not to mention the middle guy was huge too. I was squashed into the window and so was the opposite guy squashed into the walkway. The air hostesses walking by all chirpy and not even asking if passenger 32D or I was oky? Surely you could se we were sitting uncomfortably not to mention NO social distancing! The minute the seatbelt sign went off I got up and kindly asked one of the air hostesses if I could possibly move to the row behind me as it was completely open as there’s no social distancing in my row seats and the lady is like “no you can’t sit here, it’s only reserved for sick people, this row and the very first row”. I said oky, could you please take me then to a seat that’s available that has a open seat between me and a fellow passenger ? Just to get a snappy reply “ you can sit anywhere you want just not on these seats” so unhelpful ! You would think because they’ve been walking up and down checking on things that they would know which seats are available but I guess not.
Passenger 32E sees me trying to move, he came over and said he saw a open seat so he’ll just move.

"True to its reputation, FlaSafAir was on time.  We had a mishap, though, and missed our honeymoon departure from Cape Town...  Staff were very professional and calm about it and seemed to work together to get us on the next flight from stand-by an hour later!!  Honeymoon saved!On our way back, there was a passenger with an extreme fear of flying.  A grown man panicking and crying is quite a unsettling sight, but again, staff was very calm and professional about it, communicating with him throughout, accompanied him off the plane and even called his family who would collect him. It's good to know that you're in hands off staff who actually listens and thinks and makes plans.

"Flysafair rocks!

Man I loved this flight. But boy the landing....I give them 100%.

The landing was once again the typical rough ordeal. It takes away a chunk of 10%.

Often starts with a slight struggle, a toss to the right, a toss to the left at final stages of the approach, then it hits the tarmac with a thud, almost bouncing. I feel it from the seat.

"I am South African and a frequent traveller, I have experience in other local and international domestic airlines. FlySafair used to impress me. Now I will recommend Kulua, I never once had issue with them.

But this suitcase below, is a year old and has travelled across 15 countries and done 100s of hours of travel, but it could not survive a 2hr flight with Flysafair. When I went to complain to the baggage desk, they told me they don't cover wheels because they protrude from the bag, so despite rendering by bag useless with their carelessness, it's now my problem, and they'll recommend a place for me to get it fixed at my cost. Let it be known, this is not the first time I've had a baggage problem with FlySafair.

Flysafair also operates under the illusion of being a low cost airline, by making you pay separately to put your luggage in the cargo hold, this additional fee can make the overall flight pricier, than other domestic carriers. Yet despite paying this additional fee, they can't make sure my baggage doesn't break??? Or offer repair?? I've had this issue in the past with British Airways, no question about how my handle broke, they reimbursed me immediately... but just a heads up, with FlySafair, a handle also counts as a protruding object. They may cover your bag being crushed by a dinosaur, but not the things that actually break.

Also this policy as mentioned above assures travellers, especially tourists, have no space in the overhead carriers for their hand luggage, because all the passengers don't want to pay the additional fee, and therefore try fit bags that clearly don't meet the weight and size requirement (this needs to be more regulated, it isn't) and take up all the space, and so you have backpacks stashed on your laps or the floor or the staff move your hand luggage to a different location, and as a result you have to be the last person getting off the plane, to get your bag.

I am really disappointed.

"Definitely the best local airline. We departed ahead of schedule, and leading up to and even after the flight the text messages kept us well informed. I am tall so the legroom was a bit tight, but you can expect that from all low cost carriers. You do have the option to pay a little extra for exit row seats.

"My family and I booked flights to Cape Town and back on Fly Safair.  It was our first time using this airline.  We flew on flight FA 121 from O. R. Tambo to Cape Town on the 14 February 2020 at 18:45.  We checked-in and the flight departed on time and landed on-time in Cape Town at 20:58.  FlySafair sent us an sms to notify us of our gate number for boarding and also before landing they notified us via sms of the number for the carousel where we could collect our luggage.  I was really impressed with their service.  We flew back to Johannesburg on the 16 February on flight FA 293.  The flight departed on-time at 12:05 and we landed at O.R. Tambo at exactly 14:15.  Both flights were smooth on landing and take-off.  The airline sells some drinks and snacks to nibble on, but we brought our own water and snacks.  We will highly recommend this airline and it will become our airline of choice for domestic travel.

"First experience with Flysafair and the air hostess was rude almost felt racist towards people of colour.
Second flight from cape town to Lanseria was also a mess. we were stuck at the care returns traffic, rushed to check in and we told by staff that we missed check in by 2 minutes and there was no assistance they could do. We had checked in online but they could not assist us.

"This was truly a memorable experience.

My sincere gratitude to the staff of fly safair .

They went above and beyond to get me on the flight .

The gates were closed but due to their efficient response time and working together as a team i was able to board the plane .

One staff member carried my bag the other ran with my boarding pass and when I reached my seat the hostess graciously offered me some water .. and made me comfortable . Thank you guys

I was pleasntly surprised at how fast they were at ensuring I was safely boarded .

Thank you a million times more .. I was on a mission to start networking to start a project to reforrest parts of the karoo and it was so important for me to be on that flight .

I had prayed to the creator and every other holy master I could think off to get me on that flight and the staff of fly safair truly came to my rescue ..

This was an epic start to what will hopefully soon be the start of the Greenbelt from cape to Cairo . It will always be remembered that due to the efficiency of the staff of the Durban branch of fly sa fair the ground work for this porject was started

The other thing was when we were ready to take off a blue crane was blocking the runway and we had to wait for the fire rescue team to remove the Bird .. now that was also an experience for me ..I love nature and it made me feel like mother nature was wishing me well on my trip to sow the seeds of salvation in the karoo.

I was also so amazed at how well the pilot was able to fly against the strong winds to land at pe . The plane shook a lot but the pilot displayed such good pilot skills we were able to land smoothly ..
Thank you to the pilot on that day as well for a lovely journey .

"I recently flew Safair with my wife. The service from a budget airline was great. They were on time - living up to the accolades they received on both legs of the trip.
My only complaint is that the seats were a bit small. That said, I am over 1.85m in height so most seats are a problem for me :-(

The challenge for me though is that they charge you R30 for reserving your seat in advance else a seat will be automatically allocated to you, as per their website.
For me this process can be seen as a way to make more money, which I guess it is. They are running a business after all. The benefit however is that you do not have to diarise to make sure you do your online checkin to reserve your seat 24hrs before your flight.
For me it is the price of convenience which at R30 a person may just be worth it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/a9/3c/02/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HungryRover,HungryRover wrote a review Nov 2019,HungryRover,"Johannesburg, South Africa",28 contributions,10 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r726079441-FlySafair-World.html,"Safair - on time, good service but charging for advanced checkin?",,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On my recent holiday to South Africa I had booked internal flights with FlySafair. Got a fantastic deal on the fares because they had a 'Lightening Sale' and I got 30 percent off the fares which was fabulous!!

I flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town and then from Cape Town to Durban and finally from Durban to Johannesburg.

I was amazed at the amount of leg room there was on the aircraft which made the flights very comfortable. Each of the 3 flights left on time. The cabin crew were all extremely pleasant and helpful. Could not fault a thing about all 3 flights.

"My sister has cerebral palsy , she has been wheelchair bound for 27 years. We have been saving for her to go on a vacation for months,she was excited to hear that she will be flying
Our flight was at 5:50 , We arrived at OR Thambo at 04:00
We then went through the boarding gates , because i used the one line booking
When we arrived at the boarding gates , they said we must go the the special boarding gates , we went to the special boarding gates , no one once told us that my sister needed a porter to accompany her into the aircraft
when we got to the gates , we were told that we are late , she was suppose to have boarded in front of every one and that she needed a porter , we had to turn around and book new flights

to top it all off , when we arrived at Durban , my sister's wheelchair was lost , it is a special wheelchair ,because she is so small and it fits a special chair to keep her body in tact as she has no control over her body.
we run around looking for her chair , only to find another passenger was using it outside (a big man)
my sister's wheelchair is broken now , it is to wide for her to fit in , she falls over.
i sent 5 complaints to FlySafair , all that they can say is sorry

Sorry doesn't help a traumatised little girl who saved money for months to fly on your airline , Sorry doesn't fix a broken wheelchair that was saved for ,for many years by a single parent.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moniquege31,Mon!qu3 wrote a review Nov 2019,Mon!qu3,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Durban,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r724702870-FlySafair-World.html,Wheelchair assistance,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Really like my experience, and everything seemed to go smoothly. The staff are definitely friendlier than South African Airways, and I loved the fact that they kept their promise about leaving on time.

Just one small, niggly irritating thing: For a small fee you can get Priority Boarding, but it creates more stress than it solves. Passengers who qualify show a supercilious attitude, and ground staff encourage the same feeling. Is it just an attempt by the airline to get a bit more money from a few people, or a genuine desire to be helpful?

"The day that turned out to be a nightmare, my 4 year old Son was denied to fly with his Family because I only had his birth card, immunization card and his pageant certificates, his original birth certificate went missing in a car accident few weeks ago.

I had no photos of his birth certificate because He is only 4 years and doesn’t go to school, I understand your rules but how the hell do you explain to your 4 year old that He is no longer flying and that it’s not his fault that His parents were in an accident and lost his documents?

How We flew with my 2 Daughters and left my Husband and Son behind, landed in Capetown with no place to stay because his ID had to be produced in the hotel and had to sign for our room , We had to book another hotel and forfeit all the benefits We initially had should He been there.

You made us fly alone as Women and knowing exactly what is happening around South Africa with kidnaping stories and killing of women and kids.being in the flight for 2 hours not knowing where you going to sleep was a nightmare

Should We chose to stay we were not offered to change because there were no other flights and also couldn’t change to the next day. Because of the nature of our bloody tickets

Had to book the following day and also had to pay more then R2000 for them.Flysafair is Trash and I wish I could fly back in a different flight but hey, I must just keep quite for 2 hours and will never ever again.

I always flew with them everywhere, it was my very first time breaking and crying in the Airport in front of my kids. Something could have been done, his immunization card had proof from hospital that He was born by me, with my ID number and his weights and his ID Number. Isn’t that a type of Identification? If not? Why is it used in Schools and Home affairs?

"Recently flew to East London for a family function. First experience with the airline and it was a pleasant one from start to finish.

As compared to other domestic airlines, FlySafair's website is incredibly user-friendly and visually appropriate. There is minimal lag between the different stages (pages) of booking and it is obvious that the website is well-maintained. Check-in online is swift and provides several options to access one's boarding pass.

As a first, I was taken aback by the service at the check-in counter. Never before have I been so warmly welcomed and sincerely assisted by a staff member at this stage of my journey. A highly commendable feat! I am happy to share that the rest of the FlySafair staff encountered along my journey also displayed good people and service delivery skills.

The aircraft itself was clean and lacked the musky stale undertones usually left behind from the previous cohort of passengers. Take-off was right on schedule and the flight itself was comfortable. If I am to provide a negative experience, it would have to be the on-board toilets. The magenta cistern is a site to behold. I hope one isn't left as traumatized as I was!

I am delighted that my first flight with the airline was a positive one. I am most impressed with the strides, particularly information technologies, taken by the airline, making them a competitor not to be reckoned with.

"All one can say is WOW, this is what customer service is all about.

We would like to give a special shout out the In-Charge Flight Attendant, Madeleine on FA315 (HLA-CPT) on 27 July 2019, that went above and beyond.

Boarding the flight with our Mom, 70 yrs of age and we did not book/request special wheelchair assistance for a elderly passenger that cannot walk far distances, Madeleine noticed that our Mom was a bit flustered after boarding for the flight (walking the entire HLA airport and then from the boarding gate to the aircraft)

She had a chat to our Mom, as she was sitting in-front and then whilst in service, Madeleine came back to our Mom confirming that a wheelchair will be waiting for her in CPT at the gate when we disembark. I mean, WOW!! Not once did we or our Mom ask for the additional service. It just came out of the blue.

Madeleine clearly looks well after her passengers and goes above and beyond whether on the ground or up in the air.

"I took advantage of their advertisement offering cheap flights and duly booked. I've done this a few times already and never yet been disappointed. One has the option of paying extra for a bag. I didnt when booking but after noting that we had more than a carry-on bag, I booked and paid for a bag on-line. Its worth doing this as the cost of a bag at check-in is considerably higher.

The on-board refreshments are above average and very average in price - certainly cheaper than the rip-off airport pricing!

The best thing about this airline is that it flies on-time. All its competitors seem to have a lackadaisical attitude to punctuality The three or four times I've flown FlySafair have always been bang on time or even arriving a little early.

"The worst experience I ever had flying with an Airline. Firstly they arrived late from Johannesburg at Cape Town  with a lame excuse that there was another plane in their way at Jhb International and that they could not take off. Then they checked in the new passengers and we still have to wait after that for the arriving passengers on the plane to depart the plane.  Then it felt like we are chased to get into the plane in order for them to depart on time. We were already late by then, but due to a strong tail wind we made it to Johannesburg just ahead of schedule. When we collect our luggage my colleague and I discovered that our suitcases were damaged.  The one wheel of her suitcase was totally broken off with some of her luggage sticking out. Tried to report it at the FLYSAFAIR Counter just to be told that it is already late and that we should e-mail them with a complaint. We both e-mailed a complaint and funny enough they alleged that they haven't received my complaint. I e-mailed it 3 times again and they still didn't receive it. My Colleague took my complaint and e-mailed it to exactly the same address and suddenly they got it. They promised to reimburse my Colleague R900 for her suitcase which she did not yet received. The fabric of my suitcase was torn and my suitcase was dented but they refused to reimburse me because it was only ""cosmetic"" damage. My suitcase was brand new and I am really disappointed and frustrated that and Airline that claims to be professional can damage your property and then claim that it was only ""cosmetic"" damage.  When I phoned to complain about this I was told that I should have taken out the insurance option on my luggage when booking the ticket which I did not knew about as I did not booked the ticket, but my Company did. I will never make use of this Airline again and advised my Company not to make use of them in future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/d2/2b/59/izaks2016.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izaks2016,Izak wrote a review Jul 2019,Izak,"Germiston, South Africa",191 contributions,44 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r689781413-FlySafair-World.html,Flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At first i thought this could have been my own error but this is the third time it has happened. I’m not sure if it’s an error in my internet browser or possibly a tactic they use to make money.

"Flysafair competes with Mango and Kulula, the local budget airlines and exceeds them at every level. It’s on time performance is significantly better. In fact talk of the others performance is common at dinner conversations, The help via phone was exceptional (I had to move a flight) but it’s the service that was the real winner.

Typically on a 2 hour flight with Mango and Kulula you get served once, have to ask for cups etc to be removed so you can use the tray to work or suffer the indignity of having your left over meal trash for another hour or so.

Flysafair served catering, immediately started a cabin clean up and then offered a second round of eats and drinks. That too was cleaned up expeditiously.

They are seriously great value for money especially on the routes that other airlines feel it’s right to rip you off. They offer 3 different options for your flights. The basics for the business traveler who needs no luggage to the full bells and whistles which includes priority Check in, boarding and a meal voucher. Another great service you can choose what seat you want for a small fee!!!

They serve a great range of eats, snacks and drinks at reasonable prices.

I would recommend FlySafair to any local or international visitors.

Well done team FlySafair, keep up the great service!!

"Awesome airline. The only thing ""budget airline"" about them is their price. I have been flying Flysafair as my airline of choice in South Africa ever since they started out a couple of years ago. They are always on time, make booking and boarding a pleasure, don't charge you for changing flights, their online booking site has one of the best user experiences of any airline, and their cabin crew are always pleasant and helpful. Previously I traveled Kulula, despite their irritating comedic profile, because they were a cheaper option than SAA or Mango (which is also SAA), but they became so unreliable and uncomfortable, and lost their price edge. Now it is great to be at the gate waiting to board another on-time Flysafair flight, and hearing the predictable announcement about lengthy delays to Kulula or Mango flights. Price: Flysafair is excellent, Kulula, Mango, SAA much pricier. Onboard comfort and seat space: Flysafair is roomier and more modern than any of them.  On-time departure: Flysafair has never been delayed in hundreds of flights I have had with them, the other airlines I came to expect delays as they were so typical. Ground crew and cabin crew attitude: Flysafair is warm welcoming and friendly, the others can be downright hostile. The only downside of Flysafair is that it has relatively few flights in the day (which may be why they are never late), but they are so good I am happy to adjust my schedule just to be able to fly with them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/fb/4c/0b/gparkin.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/godfreyp263,Godfrey P wrote a review Jun 2019,Godfrey P,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",6 contributions,4 helpful votes,Lanseria - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r680970146-FlySafair-World.html,"South Africa's most professional, reliable and pleasant airline",Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We all make mistakes/run into problems but vis a vis the customer the main issue is how you handle it. My experience with the captioned flight was NOT good AT ALL! We were supposed to depart 18:10 so when I approached the boarding gate I was advised it is roughly 1.5 hours late! I was fuming mainly because I had received no e-mail, SMS or ph call. I phoned Safair & was informed that I had been advised (Nonsense) & that it was due to a technical problem BUT, when I queried that, I was told it was a 'domino effect' precipitated by an occurrence around 13:00! So despite 5 hours notice AND bearing in mind that may passengers were flying back from the annual tourism Indaba to ORTIA for connecting flights, NO notification! NOT GOOD at all. They may have a 90% on time arrival/departure record but as the saying goes:        you are only as good as your last transaction! Th airlines (ALL of them) need to wake up as their actions are NOT CPA compliant & it is just a matter of time before that bubble bursts - I've been waiting since 2010 for the airlines to make public their (as required by the CPA) code of conduct!  louis-THE-lawyerlouis-THE-lawyer",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/10/59/e7/louis-the-lawyer.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LOUIS-THE-LAWYER,LOUIS-THE-LAWYER wrote a review Jun 2019,LOUIS-THE-LAWYER,"Johannesburg, South Africa",193 contributions,59 helpful votes,Durban - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r678200998-FlySafair-World.html,Rather late than never,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown with FlySafair on many flights around South Africa and found that the airline is well priced. The flight timetable is also quite suitable for the many who use this airline. My flight today (9/4/2019) was calm and smooth ""sailing"". The ground crew need a little more training and etiquette and their mannerisms when dealing with the public - sometimes it is a little difficult for foreigners to understand the ground crew as the language is not very clear.

"How can you expect to pay so much for a flight to East London?

It costs R1500 for a one-way ticket from Durban to East London. It will cost R6000 for me and my partner to fly down and back for the Easter Weekend.

These are terrible prices... You advertise cheap flights but obviously not these ones.

The fact that it is cheaper to fly from Durban to Joburg, and then Joburg to East London just proves my point very well.

"Everything went smooth from Book-in time, Boarding, In-flight and landing at my destination. Give yourself proper time to book in your baggage with no rush and relax at one of the many Restaurants for a cuppa before boarding. The ground staff are very friendly and helpful. The seats have enough space for your legs and the Air Hostesses very professional. Remember to have cash or your card with you for snacks or something to drink. I have to be honest about the prices for snacks on the plane - quite expensive.  I never experienced an uncomfortable flight and felt save all the time. Disembarkation are smooth and collecting your belongings goes quite fast.

Easy online booking with good backup telephonic support if needed

Friendly and efficient service - you pay for your own refreshments
Seats are not too cramped - when you check in online, book an aisle or window seat where the corresponding aisle or window seat is already booked - they generally dont issue the middle seat unless the plane in really full.

"I would go so far as to say I will never use another airline for travelling in South Africa. For me, from now on it will always be Safair! What an awesome experience!

My husband and i fly at least twice a year, and have always used one of the other popular airlines. This time when I tried booking a couple of months ago, I could find nothing that suited my date or time,at a reasonable price. I was at my wits end as i did not want to spend so much on tickets. Looking around online to see if there werent any other options, I came across Safair. I didnt even know about such an airline, and at first thought it was a cargo plane. On lookinf further, I was surprised and thrilled to see seats were available for both the times and dates i wanted. And what was even more amazing was the fact that the price was half of what the other airlines were charging.

Booking online was easy, and I was able to receive and print confirmation immediately. I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about our flight - was ""goedkoop"" going to be ""duurkoop""........

Well...... what a wonderful surprise! Check-in was effortless, staff were friendly and helpful, and boarding was on time. The flight itself was very pleasant - the flight attendants friendly and professional, as was the pilot. The plane itself was clean and in good condition. After landing, everything was waiting for us, so in no time, a matter of minutes, we were out of the plane and on our way to fetch our baggage. This too was ready and on the carousel, and then we were on our way home.

All in all, we highly recommend this airline - for us there will never be another.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillmN669HS,jillmN669HS wrote a review Feb 2019,jillmN669HS,"Edenvale, South Africa",13 contributions,1 helpful vote,Durban - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r654365360-FlySafair-World.html,First time flying with Safair,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Last month, my rating would have been 'excellent'.
My husband and I regularly flew between Lanseria and George in 2018, and planning a few trips again this year. Upon trying to book a trip on their website, you get this response: 'There are no seats/flights available on the selected date'. I eventually contacted them through Facebook Messenger, only to be informed that this route is no longer operational, because they have 'decided to make some changes to our operations from Lanseria International Airport' and that their aircraft had been redeployed to CT International Airport as from 1 February 2019. All good and well, but why not put a notice on their website to inform their loyal customers?

"This was my first time on FlySafair and the overall experience was OK, but not better than average. Checkin was good, boarding was relatively smooth and onboard seating is OK. But somehow there was something that keeps me from feeling that the experience was beyond average. Maybe its because this is the “next” player in the South African domestic market (though SafAir as a company has much more pedigree than the previous low cost airlines that have come and gone). Or maybe its the fact that this was an older aircraft, a B737-4/5, in a market where its major competitors are mostly flying newer A320 or B737-8. Either way, I flew it as it was the return leg on a SAA ticket (with Mango flying the first sector), and I would likely not go and buy a specific FlySafair ticket again, unless it was deeply discounted.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/64/a9/34/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubergine_man,aubergine_man wrote a review Jan 2019,aubergine_man,"Geneva, Switzerland",496 contributions,7262 helpful votes,Durban - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r642850961-FlySafair-World.html,"Decent airline, my first time, OK experience",Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"As I've been disappointed by new entrants to the SA market before, I steered clear of FlySafAir - it turned out to be a mistake, as my first two flights with them were refreshingly good. The leg room is exceptional for a low cost carrier (enabled by thin-shell seats). I like the fixed seats (no recline, but still very comfortable), so one's space doesn't get invaded by the person in front of you leaning back.

Snack selection seems small (I didn't buy any) but adequate for our short SA flights. Boarding experiences also good, and hand luggage allowance fine.

"This was the first time I tried a low cost airline Capetown where low cost airlines are becoming a fashion, why did I choose them I am yet to find out.

its a shocker - I yesterday called to check something about my flight, someone “Lesedi” answering the phone, unprofessional. You can hear this person doesn’t want to be @ work.

Firstly I paid huge amount and now service I get is a shocker, when I tell her I can’t hear you can you speak louder, her answer was “ oh well you are calling a call center” their discussions with other staff I could hear which I have no interest in . Wait that’s not it.......

Waiting for her while she’s trying to increase her sounds, I tell her that please check our flights she says she needs to verify me on her system. So answer her question. I give her our dates. She tells me that I don’t have any flight booked. I almost fell off my desk.
I almost lost my head starting to think what happened did I now paid these third parties & they never booked. While I am talking to her my wife’s giving me dates and mentioned that we did book with FlySafair. So I give this lady my Departure dates, she says again NO.....

The hammer was, that I checked all my emails, personal and work. I might have moved that specific email confirmation somewhere....service was horrible the way she’s answering us, constant fear that our money is gone - simply horrible.

I even logged in to my internet banking to check when I paid for this, I was on my way to bank to find out who charged my credit card & what company so I can figure out this mystery. I was in two minds now if we really booked FlySafair or someone else , because Ms Lesedi was confident that we don’t have booking.
I almost paid British Airways for new tickets, thinking about not being able to see my grandma for her 80 B Day. British airways would have been better choice perhaps. I didn’t pay decided to go to bank.

When I was going through my banking statements etc, Not realizing that I am perhaps panicking about nothing, so I called again and someone professional Anwer’s the phone no background noises, after verifying my self she’s telling me how can I assist you with your reservation!!!!! I was shocked that I now have reservation for flights. I managed to speak with Assistant Managers about this & all they did is apologize:(.

"Having learned from my flight Johannesburg to Cape Town, I made sure I boarded last.
Otherwise much of the same, except that one of the cabin crew entertained us by cleaning her fingernails whilst seated for landing - disgusting!!!

My feed back to FlySafair which was in detail did not go into any detailed answer just stated that I should book seats over the wing for more leg room.

The fact that there is no mention when booking on line that the seats don't recline was also just ignored.

My suggestion, guys at FlySafair, come to India and see how low cost Airlines are operated - they are champions here for sure!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5ChrisP,Chris P wrote a review Oct 2018,Chris P,"Bengaluru, India",18 contributions,10 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r625283505-FlySafair-World.html,Customer Service Feedback - stinks,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was the first time I tried a low cost airline outside of India where low cost airlines operate superbly.
its a shocker to cut it short - aircraft is old, the crew - cabin crew that is on this flight less then friendly and the Big Bang came when I realised that I had booked the worst seat on the aircraft 1C.
Firstly I paid extra for sitting up front extra leg room etc next when making the on line booking it did not show the configuration as actual and having priority boarding absolutely no bonus as ever other passenger has to pass this seat - it was hell. The air was stall till 30 minutes into the flight and the flight was delayed because of some problems with th baggage so we could listen to the 2 cabin crew members in front of their discussions.
The hammer was, that once the trolley service was started which was swift and smooth, passengers congregated in front on their way to the loo and thus constant bumping - simply horrible.
When the food service was announced it was announced that all major credit cards will be accepted when I wanted to pay with my American Express - the card was declined so is American Express a minor credit card?
Has a super Chicken Mayonnaise sandwich - really great - otherwise I will want to forget this flight!!!

"When it was announced that our pilot was female, I became concerned, not because I am chauvinistic, but because who ever flies into the East London airport has to be highly skilled as only the best are able to land a plane in the windiest conditions in the country. In the past 30 years my wife and I have flown into East London airport while the plane has been thrown about the sky by the strong winds. Twice the winds have almost pushed the plane into the ground and once at the last second the very experienced pilot had to abort, pull up the landing wheels, send the plane staggering skywards just when we were about to touch the runway. Then due to the wind he had to fly out to sea and circle for half an hour before he could return and bring us down safely. Our grandson (4 years) was travelling with us and thought that this was an amazing roller coaster ride, while the rest of us including the air hostesses needed a change of underwear. Normally when landing, the pilots bring the plane in at a fast angle and then at the last moment correct and slam the plane down onto the runway. So my concern was more that, does she have the experience and nerve to land us safely? Well, she aced the landing in very strong winds, a tribute to her skill and training. The cabin staff were excellent, attentive and helpful.

"I actually wanted to give this airline a better rating, as their prices are very cheap and the staff are all very friendly and professional, but my average rating reflects on an experience I had on my first flight of 3 in the past month. For family matters we had to fly  between Pretoria and Cape Town, Safair had the cheapest, last minute one way tickets.During the first flight we saw some sparks come out of the left engine, but the crew reassured us that the Captain says we can safely continue our journey. It was a scary flight with  some really bad turbulence, but we landed safely and upon disembarking we could see a huge puddle of oil already under the engine. Apart from this scary first flight, I used their service for two more flights. On the second flight we had a medical emergency on board and it was my experience that the crew handled it very well.The third flight happened without incident, apart from the friendly crew. The flights are cheap, but when booking online, one has to watch out for extra costs, like unclicking pre-added stuff and also limiting yourself to the 7 kg hand luggage limit.

"This was my first experience of flying with this South African low-cost airline, on the recommendation of friends and a colleague that were familiar with it. The entire experience is seamlessly integrated, from booking online, receiving a receipt via email and being able to check in online 24 hours prior to the scheduled flight and getting an e-boarding pass on my mobile phone.

On the day of flying, the airline sends a text message 2.5 hours before take-off. On arrival at the airport, I was able to go directly to the boarding gate. The boarding passes a processed as we wait and the luggage policy helps me to be more economical in how I pack, since 7kg of luggage and a handbag are free.

The airline rightly prides itself on getting its passengers to their destination on time. I have appreciated the predictability of what they offer and how it helped me be organised for my travel.

I will definitely be using it as my preferred local airline.

"In most ways, FlySafair is no different from any other budget airline. You get what you pay for. But for some reason they have adopted a new boarding procedure that is really inconvenient for its passengers. Information boards tell you the flight is boarding when in fact it isn't and won't be for a long time. This means that instead of sitting down somewhere to wait you have to join a queue and stand in line for 20 minutes or more. Then once boarding actually starts, your boarding pass is examined by ground staff but as you move down to the plane you are again held in a queue in the air bridge for up to another 20+ minutes. This is really tough on the elderly and parents travelling with young children. On a hot day it is very uncomfortable for all.

"First time having flown with Safair today 11/09/18. And having boarded the first flight of the day i have to admit i was absolutely amazed and never felt so happy with service and a flite as i have with Safair.

Believe you me i have flown with multiple airlines i also have read so much negative reviews and heard of bad experiences with Safair. However until tried you never know.
First of all having to fly with a medical condition severe bruising to ribs and not feeling 100 percent well physically and the last thing anyone in my condition would have wanted was added issues in service delivery especially at 5h30am.

But from the get go upon checking in how awful of me with all the pain i was already in, cant really recall the name of the attendant that assisted me in CT International but he was the best, like a godsend at that time of morning and his willingness to assist me and make my check in such a breeze i will never forget him even if i tried. It's consultants like him that makes a passengers morning even through the immense pain I've been gritting i will forever be greatful for his assistance. Also inflight, the cabin crew were simply the best, i also had the best tasting cappuccino ever i swear. Extremely helpful and courteous staff.

So my advice to anyone is before believing everything you read or are told take a chance and open yourself up to a new experience you will be amazed.
Also our flight was right on schedule as well as we arrived 20mins ahead of schedule. Now that for me was the cherry on top.

"To preface this review I have to state that domestic flights within South Africa are exhorbitantly expensive and cost us nearly half of what our international flight did.
Having said that, we found Safair to be the most affordable option even when we chose the premium option with an item of checked baggage and priority boarding.( safair regular tickets only allow hand luggage.) The priority boarding was a sales gimmick because it seemed to only be priority boarding onto the bus that took us to our plane, from there on we were swamped by everyone else and ended up boarding after half the plane was filled already.

The aircraft itself was not exactly a hotel in the sky but that is not necessary for a 2 hour flight. The chairs were comfortable enough albeit rather small, And We didn’t have much leg space in front. They did offer us snacks and drinks but to our own extra cost.
The flight was smooth and the captain kept us well informed of turbulence and overhead sites, and within 2 very quick hours we had landed.

I would love to say Safair was good value for money, however I cannot because I firmly believe ALL South African domestic flights are way overpriced.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/71/62/91/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenfielding,darrenfielding wrote a review Aug 2018,darrenfielding,"Hangzhou, China",161 contributions,49 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Port Elizabeth,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r611766351-FlySafair-World.html,"Straightforward, simple flying.",Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We checked baggage in 2 hours early. Flight was at 11:30am . Lines were long at airport security check caused a delay. Gate was changed at the last minute.  We missed the flight.

"Flight Number: FA100 12 July=5.45am flight. During our flight Melissa who was the flight attendant on duty treated us quite poorly. Melissa along with Shannon were quite moody and miserable.

During the time for purchasing snacks and drinks Melissa deliberately ignored us and did not ask us whether we we wanted to purchase something to eat or drink. When my father stopped Melissa for a bottle of water when she walked passed us she said ""Im busy"" and did not bother to come back to us. Eventually we had to call another flight attendant and the In charge flight attendant came and said she had forgotten and simply laughed it off as if it were a joke.

"First traveling with this airline and I experienced mixed feelings. Seats were comfortable but pressure build up was terrible compared to other airlines. The worse of all that I realized it’s not always advisable to rush for cheap flights as there are hidden clauses and the advertisements are not always interpreted the way we see it. Due to family Emergency I could not get my flights canceled or converted to a voucher for later use. I was told that vouchers are only given when cancellation is done 45 days prior. Other available option was to pay R300 per flight to make changes even if it was just a change from my name to my wife with same surname. This was a ridiculous option especially with purchasing flights for the same price.
On flight, I came across the magazine which stated that a cancellation upgrade could be done with R200 where a voucher can be chosen. However this turns out to be a misleading marketing front which was explained further that the R200 must be added when booking a new flight.
There’s basically no way out once you book as they seem to have hidden explanations for any question asked.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neelanv,neelanv wrote a review Jul 2018,neelanv,"Sandton, South Africa",3 contributions,,Johannesburg - Durban,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r594372021-FlySafair-World.html,Hidden clauses,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I've flown FlySafair a few times now and the flights have always, and I mean always, been on time. This alone is reason enough to fly with them. Online check in is a breeze - you can download your boarding pass to your mobile phone, saving paper and time at the airport. The mobile boarding pass is easy to use and scans easily. The seats on the aircraft are quite small, but I'm small so it's not too uncomfortable for me. The legroom is adequate considering the price you pay. One thing I don't really like is that you pay extra to book your seat, even just a regular seat with no extra legroom. This can make the initial price of the ticket quickly add up. I would definitely recommend travelling with hand luggage only - this is free, so your ticket price is lower than if you check luggage in. The staff are friendly and the food for purchase on board, while not exactly cheap, is not grossly overpriced.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F9694BPshannond,Shannon d wrote a review May 2018,Shannon d,,7 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - George,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r581895817-FlySafair-World.html,"Don't be delayed, fly FlySafair!",Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have flown with about all the airlines in South Africa and Fly Safair has surprised me in a few areas of service. In the beginning their website is not to user friendly and it takes a few times to get use to their logic of thinking in order to make a booking.  I am use to book myself in at the self-checking in machines but for some reason fly Safair is not registered on the machines.  The people at their counters is friendly and very supportive.  Not one of my flights departed “ON Time” but very impressively we landed every time “On Time”. All drinks and snacks during the flight can only be paid by card, “no cash” which I find a bit irritated  as there is NO quick deal for payment. To certain destinations fly Safair is absolutely the cheapest  but on my next flight Cape Town/Johannesburg I got better prizes from another airways.

"What an absolute pleasure it was arranging my return trip to George recently.
The booking process is simple and effective. The payment option that offers a bit of leeway before payment, comes in handy when one needs some time to get the payment done.
Online check in works fine. On the return trip I found out that one can board with the electronic boarding pass on your smart phone, thus eliminating the need to print a boarding pass.

It was a long weekend so obviously there was high demand. But I've flown Kulula and Mango on similar occasions and i've never had any issues squeezing my knees in before. I'm only 5'6'' so not exactly big or tall. They squeezed in as many rows of chiars as they possibly could and it was claustrophobic.

"I booked a flight and the online booking system keeps trying to add extras to the price e.g. insurance, car, extra bags. The system showed one free checked bag but when I arrived, they said there was no checked bag and demanded R250 for a checked bag. With no other option, I reluctantly paid.

I went onto the system later and verified that it indeed did include a checked bag. After contacting them, they admitted that there was a glitch on their system. I have all this communication in writing.

They haven't offered to reimburse me for their mistake.

How many people have experience the same problem ? This is such a dishonest way of forcing people to pay for baggage.

"FlySafair were far cheaper than other options between PE and CPT for a Sunday afternoon - the BA/Comair and SAA options were at least 1.5x the price.

Boarding was quick and efficient, after we watched the PE ground staff turn the plane that had just arrived from CPT in a mere 20 minutes. In such quick turns, one usually expects to find rubbish in the cabin etc. but everything was clean and ready to go when we boarded.

Once aboard, cabin crew were fresh-faced and handled a range of challenges well - including infants and a guy who couldn't fit his stuff in the overhead bin. We departed quickly and had a lovely flight over to CPT, arriving over 15 minutes early. It would have been nice to hear a PA from the flight crew before reaching cruise altitude (the first we heard from them), but there probably wasn't time given the PE terminal's proximity to the runway.

While Safair's fleet is showing their age (our aircraft was at least 25 years old - with doubler strips visible at various points on the fuselage, and lots of loose rubber flying about in spaces in the wing controls), they provided a timely, efficient, and safe operation for a reasonable price.

"Book ahead on their website and you'll will find great deals.

The sales, checking desk were very helpful. My flight into JNB arrived late due delays from LOS, I informed the customer service via mail (from Los explaining the situation) and on arrival at JNB, they were already expecting me, my no show fee was waived...(they deserved a hug and kiss)

Boarding was quite fast, as we board from both front and rear depending on pax seat number.

It's B73's has an all economy seat Configuration.

In flight refreshments are sold on board and price is ok (I guess...LoL)

Flight attendants are super friendly and helpful...it's almost like they get a bonus for smiling. They can be playful too, I observed they aren't the usual uptight flight attendants one is used to, I liked their culture (from observation)

I observed on all my flights the cockpit crew were 3 (Maybe it's routine or some crew is just jump-seating, I didn't bother to ask)

Note:
Arrive early for your flight.

Bulky carry on luggage won't fit into their overhead stowage.

Don't pack too much luggage if you must enjoy the low fare.

No in flight entertainment so bring yours along.

"Most uncomfortable seats ever. This airline is flying an ageing fleet of Boeing 737's that are really showing their age. The seats would not look out of place in a model airplane.

As this was peak season there was no one at the Safair damaged goods to assist with the reporting of the damaged luggage.

"Had no idea about domestic South African airlines and there are many choices, so I just chose the cheapest. After booking I was a little concerned as there wasnt many reviews at the time about Safair. However after flying there was nothing to worry about.

The flight was on time, easy boarding, friendly crew, buy on board service and a clean aircraft.

"The airline has a reputation for on-time departures, and true to form, the flight left on time and arrived on time. However, beware of paying for extras.

I paid for priority boarding, but priority passengers were not called first. All passengers simply lined up at will, with many pushing their way to the front. I also paid for an assigned seat at the time I made my reservation, which I think was worth it since it guaranteed me a seat in the front of the plane.

If you want to pay for checked luggage online, make sure you do it before you check in online. Once you check in online, you cannot go back and add luggage and will have to pay for it at the airport (at a higher cost).

Overall, it was a short pleasant flight at a reasonable cost.

Thanks to some incredible flying by the pilots, we were all able to get home after what felt like the longest 5 minutes of our lives. The wind must have been gusting close to 100km/h and some how, the pilot managed to straighten the plane as we hit the runway (on one wheel I might add). Half of us were in tears and after both wheels hit the ground a loud applause broke out. I am so incredibly proud of our SA pilots. They have such a fantastic reputation worldwide and I now understand why. I don't think people realize just how stressful their jobs can be. To the two pilots and crew from that SAFAIR flight.

The price was very good, and therefore economical.
You can lower your price by ignoring all the offered bells and whistles, which is really all the regular flyers want, as for us the treat is the destination not the flight there.

"Last night I had the absolute misfortune of traveling with FlySafair.

When I checked in at the Port Elizabeth Airport, I asked for a window seat as my 6 year old was traveling with me.

We boarded the plane and I was told that I had to leave my bag behind. Since I had something fragile in my bag and it was well under the restricted weight (I had it weighed at the check-in counter), I refused, which upset the hostess.

When we got to our seat, the window seat we were given, 11A, had no window! My daughter was heavily upset and threw a tantrum, which upset me, as I specifically asked for a window seat! For a 6 year old, looking forward to a flight, which was a new experience for her, not having a window seat was a big deal.

The seats are tiny and uncomfortable, which is still okay, considering it is a low cost airline. I could live with that.

After eventually managing to distract my daughter, by telling her I would buy her a sandwich and juice, it was even more annoying when I was told that the sandwiches are out of stock! How do these people plan their catering?

When we disembarked, my daughter asked the hostess if she could see the cockpit, but was told no, the flight crew is busy. The hostess did not even offer to check with the captain, she did not give a hoot about making a little child happy - she just said no.

I will never ever, under any circumstances, use FlySafair again! Their lack of service is not worth my hard earned money! I fly often for work, but I will not support this airline again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooTaz,BooTaz wrote a review Dec 2017,BooTaz,"Port Elizabeth, South Africa",63 contributions,25 helpful votes,Port Elizabeth - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r545301357-FlySafair-World.html,Never again! ,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I normally pay extra for my ticket to enjoy priority boarding, but there is a major problem.

We boarded the 2nd of 3 buses. I noticed that no bus departed until all 3 were ""ready"". Ours was packed to capacity! We stood in the bus for 15 minutes, sweat dripping, before going to the plane. (Surely when a bus is full it should go to the plane)?
I confronted the bus driver as to why we were kept waiting on the bus. His reply: ""I had to wait for clearance"". As to why the air con in the bus wasn't working: ""I didn't switch it on because not supposed to wait so long""!

"This was my first experience with FlySafair and I must say it won't be my last. The flight up to Joburg was without incident and we somehow managed to land well before the scheduled time, but that could have been an error?
On the return flight back to Cape Town my seat as well as the fold out table were full of crumbs which I feel should have been cleaned before we boarded! We did hit some turbulence but nothing too severe. I experienced some earache during the decent but I'm still not sure whether this is something the flight crew have much control over.

FlySafair is a highly efficient operation and compares more than favourably with the best of budget airlines. They are constantly offering unbeatable fares around South Africa and if you aren't needing the extras you can often pick up a fantastic deal!

Give them a try, you won't be sorry!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/a1/60/e2/stevenment.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenment,Steven M wrote a review Oct 2017,Steven M,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",39 contributions,24 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r537042636-FlySafair-World.html,Efficiency at a great price!,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town has a duration of +- 2 hours, it's short enough that you don't require a meal or flight attendant servicing adding to additional costs, SAFAIR made these ""Bells & Wistles"" that only escalate the ticket price an optional extra that you could buy in flight, and kept the fair lower, I like that they don't force this on your air fare, with the sloppy meals usually served on a flight.

Most of their Airplanes (as far as I have seen) has been around for some time, but have been given new finishes where required.

Their prices were the lowest by a few hundred Rand and their service was on parr or better. No complaints from my side!

"We travelled from Perth to Johannesburg with SAA, collected our two suitcases and checked them in at the Safair counter. we were made to sign, on the boarding pass, that there were no iPads or cellular phones in the suitcases.
Upon arriving at the hotel in Cape Town we realised that both suitcases were broken into (we realised that only at the hotel, as the suitcase closures were organised as if nothing was wrong). One suitcase locking system was broken in a way that it could still be locked. On the other, the zipper was broken, and therefore unsuitable for further travel.
Nothing was stolen, as there were only clothing and shoes in the suitcases.
When contacting the airline offices we were told to go to the police.
We were in Cape Town for only a week and were not prepared to spend time at police and insurance offices.
Our main issue is with the airline. If they make us sign at check-in that there are no electronic devices in the suitcase, they obviously know there is a problem.
So, either solve the problem, or, send the passengers to wrap their suitcases in plastic wrap.
In many years of travel, it was the first time that our luggage was broken into, and this leaves a bad impression and decreases ones desire to re-visit South Africa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aeng2016,aeng2016 wrote a review Jun 2017,aeng2016,"Perth, Australia",30 contributions,19 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r496766831-FlySafair-World.html,Beware of flying Safair,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"FlySafair entered the South African commercial aviation market about 2 years ago bringing much needed competition to the few other domestic options.

Wrapped in a real low-cost airline model, their fares are generally cheaper than what you’ll find on kulula/BA and SAA/Mango, however, you will always need to pay more for checked luggage and other auxiliaries.

Their fleet is a mix of old and new but I like the airline – in my experience, always on time, safe and more affordable.

SAFAIR claims they are the most on-time airline and are are ruthless with check-in times etc BUT their cabin crew arrived late for our flight and then when I referred to it the head hostess was extremely rude and then the captain when we left the aircraft was poking fun at me and being a real ponce.  Unacceptable.  Not the only unpleasant experience - generally rude cabin staff who are unyielding and think they are doing their patrons a favour. I highly doubt they offer their cabin crew training or perhaps they have to take who they can get and so they are untrainable.

"The first time to fly this airline.  My wife and I did a return flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg and were very impressed with their time keeping.  Departures and arrivals were on the dot. While the seats do not recline and there is no entertainment on board, for a short hop like this that is not serious. Cabin crew were outstanding and the flight crew kept us posted, which we enjoyed.

"I tried booking a flight online to Cape Town from Durban this morning two months in advance due to the low price of R599.00. Everything went fine until I tried to pay the Safair system kicks you off and when you try to rebook the flight is more expensive. R699. When I called the call centre the lady, Chane Bester, was inept and could not help. Plus I had to spell my surname 4 times! I asked to speak with a manager as we were talking in circles and the response  "" our flights are subject to availability"" means nothing to me as you cannot seriously try and convince me that a flight to Cape Town  2 months in advance is booked up and that is why prices are increasing. Spoke with a Asheleigh Barnard who was just as inept and clueless! This is shocking service and robbery! DISGUSTING! I will rather pay more and fly Mango or any other airline.

Arriving in Johannesburg safair left 22 bags in Capetown due to a broken belt. In the bags is my mothers medication that she need. safair will deliver the bag in the next 3 days.... not good. I had to drive to Pretoria to drop my sick mother home and drive back to Johannesburg to collect the bags 4 hours later.

"This was my worst flying experience ever. Upon arriving at ORTambo on an international flight and being several hours early we asked to change our tickets to an earlier flight to Cape Town. This they were willing to do at a cost of more than the original ticket price. hence the flight left with open seats and dissatisfied passengers. Our 11.15 flight was then postponed for over two hours and once the gate number had changed three times and we were finally ready to board we had to deal with the most unfriendly ground crew who preferred to argue with already unhappy passengers. There were nearly 10 ground crew and not one was paying any attention to the passengers.

"Overall: Super efficient no nonsense offering, with easy check in procedure and most importantly before time arrival.

Pros:
- very reasonably one way fares, though checked in luggage is R100 per bag.
- easy to use web check in and availability to make use of boarding pass printing at the airport (at least in CPT and PLZ).
- reasonable in flight drink prices.

Cons:
- their mobile website is rather poor, making it difficult to use.
- don't participate in a mileage program, whereas on SAA miles can be earned on the Star Alliance program.

Whilst referring this review to my most recent flight to PLZ I want to add that each flight I had so far with Safair departed early and arrived early. This is a low cost airline and as such their is no free in flight service as well as no in flight entertainment, which in the age of tablets is easily forgivable.

The seats are not designed for long haul flights and table trays are just poor. Legroom is surprisingly big and beats long haul Emirates or Delta easily.

Service was as always professional and not in any way different from SAA. Personally I try to avoid the failing yet highly subsidized national carrier and rather support small start ups like Safair or Comair.

The planes are of the older generation and I believe one machine was an old Al Italia airbus :), which is something to be aware off that probably most machines are ""refurbished"" older planes.

I recommend anyone flying nationally to give them a try and see for yourself if it is not possible to say goodbye to SAA and BA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/99/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agter_Paarl,Agter_Paarl wrote a review Jan 2017,Agter_Paarl,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",9 contributions,2 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Port Elizabeth,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r448766647-FlySafair-World.html,"Preferred local carrier, by far",Date of travel: January 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Booked a flight from George to Johannesburg and back for my wife to fly on the 26 Nov 2016.

Unfortunately my wife contracted pneumonia and we therefore had to cancel due to doctors instructions.

Sent the necesary documentation including doctors note to them on the 21 Nov requesting a credit.

Have now followed up on 4 occasions including this morning which is now 37 days since the credit was requested.

Their agent tells me it's being processed as refunds take between 7 to 21 days to process (can't she count the dunce!)

I can see by other reports on our local service sites that Flysafair couldn't be bothered responding to complaints so all I can say is people go Kulula or SAA maybe at more expense because should you have a genuine cancellation it's going to be like getting blood out of a stone to get your money back.

This complaint via their Facebook site brought about immediate action and we've received a refund less R800 which is also nonsense since we took out cancellation insurance.

Seems our problems are not yet over such a pity that companies spend so much money on encouraging people to use them and then do this type of thing when genuine problems arise

"We missed check in by 4 minutes due to a complication with the rental hand back, and were told we had missed the flight. This resulted in us having to pay for an additional nights accommodation, additional transport and additional payments for flights.

I really felt that the way the staff handled ourselves and the other couple was inferior, and we understood, but then to say the aircraft flew is half empty, just rubbed salt into the wound.

4 minutes, plus we had priority boarding on our pre booked seats, paid for as an addition to the fare, this was not acceptable.

Safair staff are friendly.  Every flight has been on time but most have arrived early. The only problem I experienced was not with the airline as flight attendant announced that all First Car Rental customers will get 25 per cent discount if boarding pass shown when hiring their car.  I did this but to date haven't heard or received the discount even though they took my boarding pass.  The previous time I flew with Safair in August 2016 they gave me a voucher on disembarking which I also handed to First Car Rental but never received that discount either.

"If I could summarize with one word, it would be ""CRAMPED"". Yeah, they are a low cost airline, I wasn't expecting to dangle my feet over the edge of the Grand Canyon, but it would be great it I had just a little more room so that my knees don't jam into the backrest infront of me.
The seats don't recline at all.
The PA system is so poor that, besides the rowdy group on board, I could not make out a single announcement by either the cabin crew or the Pilot. (Could also be due to poor soundproofing - damn those engines are loud).

Otherwise it was a smooth experience and flight, but unless you're getting one of their insanely cheap deals, then rather spend your money on an airline that has reclining seats, and perhaps an audible PA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/f0/3f/ee/alexstruck.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexStruck,Alex S wrote a review Sep 2016,Alex S,"Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa",8 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r417820797-FlySafair-World.html,"Cheap, but a little too cheerful",Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was my second flight with this airline and was as impressed as my first trip. The plane was on time both legs and the seats were not uncomfortable. The pilot kept the passengers fully informed along the route. You can tell by the tone and wording of the messaging that they enjoyed thier jobs. If there was one negative, it was that the check in only opened 2 hours before the flight and we had arrived a bit early at the airport and had planned to sit in the Business Lounge for the wait. We had a bag to book in otherwise the on line boarding pass would have allowed us to enter the departures area a bit earlier.

Boarding gates opened 20 minutes later than scheduled. Prices for food/drinks ridiculous. Seats are extremely hard on the backside and have no reclining function...hence a budget airline. Flight was smooth and uneventful, just the way I like it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewdowner,andrewdowner wrote a review Aug 2016,andrewdowner,"Pretoria, South Africa",78 contributions,29 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Cape Town Central,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r401121223-FlySafair-World.html,Careful the pitfalls,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We departed and arrived on-time; baggage claim took a bit too long on arrival in George.

"Having just returned from London I took the opportunity to visit a friend in KZN because of the excellent airfare on offer. Good pilot, good crew. Comfortable smooth flight. Two days after returning I received a call to say I had left my I.d. Book on the airplane. I hadn't even realised I didn't have it in my possession. The level of service I received when I went to collect my book amazed me. Shirley, Lebo, Rebecia, all outstanding.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gilda18,Gilda18 wrote a review Aug 2016,Gilda18,"Sandton,South Africa",271 contributions,94 helpful votes,Durban - Johannesburg,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r400954477-FlySafair-World.html,Excellent service.,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew on Safair from Cape Town to East London and was surprised at the level of cleanliness and punctuality of the flight.

In spite of it being a low-cost carrier, the leg room was sufficient, and the seat was very comfortable.
The flight took off on time and landed earlier than its ETA - a regular feature of Safair.

Next time I travel in South Africa, I will try as much as possible to choose Safair for all internal flights.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/22/98/6c/karlwalker.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karlwalker,Karlwalker wrote a review Aug 2016,Karlwalker,Terre Rouge,35 contributions,12 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - East London,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r400872776-FlySafair-World.html,Excellent Low-Cost Airline,Date of travel: June 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
