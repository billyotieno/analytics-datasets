[{"Title":"Recently I travelled for business from Cape Town to Entebbe (Uganda) with a layover in Nairobi (Kenya) return. On the flight to Uganda we flew in a Embraer 190 which is a smaller plane with 2 seats on each side (economy class) and on the return flight we flew with a larger Boeing 737 which had 3 seats on each side. Overall the food and drinks selection in economy class on both flights was good and filling enough for me, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I also had more than enough legroom on each of the flights and the seats were comfortable. The in-flight entertainment in the Embraer was limited with 2 movies and a couple of TV shows (random bundled episodes of different shows per genre) with some music also available. On the Boeing there was a lot more content available however the sound quality was bad - I could barely hear even with the sound on its loudest setting. On our flight to Uganda we had a stop at Harry Mwanga Nkumbula Airport (Zambia) at which point I was automatically upgraded, for free, to Business Class. As you would expect, the seats were a bit more comfortable and there was more legroom available. Also, the selection of food and drinks was much better. I am not sure if I would pay the amount they are charging for Business Class, however I enjoyed the experience. Overall I am quite happy with my experience and will definitely fly with them again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/22/df/a3/7c/dewald-r.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewaldr","crvsd":"Dewald R wrote a review Nov 2022","ui_header_link":"Dewald R","default":"Cape Town Central, South Africa","phmbo":"2336 contributions","phmbo1":"198 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r870188817-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Cape Town to Uganda via Nairobi and Back","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The flight plan was Bangui-Nairobi (27/11, with a technical stop in Douala). We choose to book confortable Crowne Plaza in nice Nairobi in between flights. Then Nairobi-Zanzibar (28/11, ETA 9H30).\n\nArriving in Douala around 2pm we stayed grounded.\nFirst we got explained that there was not enough jeta1.\nThen, there was a technical issue and engineer needed instructions from Nairobi.\nThen, he got the instructions but he missed a spare part.\n\nWe were disembarked around 5pm : begin of the nightmare. we had to wait till 6pm in a non AC room. Without any words of the crew or a glass of water.\n\nThen, it was so disorganized for the passengers without CEMAC passports to get a visa : it took around 1.5 hours. I asked if we could already go and ask to the Kenya Airway office to which hotel we should go. The crew answered that we had to wait for all the passengers.\n\nFinally the guy at the Kenya Airways office told us that we could go to Akwa Palace or Bano Palace. And that the spare part will not come before 2 pm the day after so that we ll not depart before 4pm the day after !\n\nThen we finally got on a bus with a driver that yell on us (because nobody really knew where to go). We decided to took a taxi with my husband and go directly to Akwa Pamace (with nobody yelling at us during the transfer).\n\nArriving at Akwa Palace : the hotel told us that we should go to Bano Palace. Arriving to Bano \"Palace\" : it was so dirty, smelling bad and food was so bad... tje sheets were dirty. We got a second room that smells something like... cigarret mixed with humidity. Plus AC didn't work properly. Plus we got only one bath towel. No water in the room. It was so dirty that we went outside for dinner.\n\nAnyway after all these I tried to call Kenya Airway' client support. I got an email during the night saying that our flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar was the 30/11 at 00.30 ... and our flight from Douala to Nairobi the 30/11 at... 20pm. PM. So we will do Douala-Nairobi after Nairobi Zanzibar, yep... everything is possible with Kenya Airways.\nWifi in hotel did not worked properly. From 4 in the morning I tried to reach via call & whatsapp... we also went to the airport around 8 am. We waited till 10.30 am before seeing someone from Kenya Airways. they were surprised that Akwa Palace refused us. Obviously it was too late for the Rwandair flight that could have bring us to Nairobi.\n\nAround 1.30 pm we finally got a rebooking proposition (yep, we waited from 8 am to 1.30 pm in a non AC' airport). And remember, I did not sleep all night before that.\n\nThe proposition is a 21hours journey (3 flights) with Ethiopian Airline. In economic class, with refund (which I have to claim for! and perhaps you will refund within 21 to 30 days...). I asked to be booked in first class : refused. I asked to Ethipian to pay for the upgrade : too late!\n\nBoarding tome : 1.20 pm. It s 2.30 pm and we are still waiting without any explanation of course.\n\nSo, guys, flying with Kenya Airways and you get :\n\n- Degraded from sky priority to economic.\n- Lost hotel reservations in Nairobi and Zanzibar.\n- Lost 2 tours reservations in Zanzibar.\n- Loosing time to make the claim.\n- Loosing at least 2.5 days of Holiday.\n\nIS THIS WHAT YOU CALL PREMIER WORLD ?","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginieAn","crvsd":"Virg A wrote a review Nov 2022","ui_header_link":"Virg A","default":"","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Bangui - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r869990160-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Horrible experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It is incredibly unreliable and has terrible customer service. I was about to travel from Lilongwe in Malawi to Entebbe in Uganda via Nairobi, only to discover after a 5 hour drive to Lilongwe airport that the flight was cancelled because of a pilots' strike. This was at midnight. Received no email, nothing. Following day tried to get on another flight, could not; in the end the company i was working for had to book a new flight with Ethiopian following day. On my return flight from Entebbe two weeks later, my Kenya Airways flight from Entebbe was late and I missed my connection to Lilongwe. The airline then put me on different flight the following day and I had to spend one night in airport hotel in Nairobi. We had to wait three hours in airport terminal in Nairobi before they could be bothered to find our bags in the hold and we could be transferred to the hotel. Customer service was terrible. they could not even be bothered to bring us water. Avoid this appalling airline at all costs.

It would have been his first-ever flight for the Songkran break in 2020 and we booked Kenya Airways. It would have been my first flight with them as I have only ever flown with other airlines such as Etihad or Emirates. That was our first mistake. We were excited about the trip but then COVID hit and all flights were cancelled. We were given the option to rebook for later that year which we did, and booked for December, thinking that it should be better by then, our second mistake. When it did not get better and still there were no flights, we were given the option of cancelling and getting a refund or taking the voucher to use within two years. We chose the voucher (our third mistake) thinking that we were going to be able to use it. Fast forward to the beginning of this year. I have learned that Kenya  Airways no longer flies to and from Bangkok and they do not have a branch here anymore. I have been trying to get the refund of the vouchers. I have emailing back and forth with customer service for months and everytime they say they will check with the relevant department and get back to me but they never do. It was not our fault that COVID disrupted everything yet it seems that they have no one working at Kenya Airways because no one knows what the status of the refund is. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AIRLINE!!!! Very poor service and do not try to get a refund from them, you will lose your money. In future, I will pay a little more and book with a better airline.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bronproc","crvsd":"Bronwyn P wrote a review Oct 2022","ui_header_link":"Bronwyn P","default":"Bangkok, Thailand","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r864339651-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Extremely bad service","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The entire trip including Zanzibar stay of was pre-booked and paid for about a year ago, most of it, as the accommodations, non-refundable. Hence I boosted my travel insurance, included all “ifs” and bumped it to 15k USD, just in case.\n\nHowever, all went very well except for one issue, and that was with Kenya Airways. The ticket to Zanzibar on Sept 18th with flight KQ 494 was booked and paid 9 months in advance, flight departure 18:20.\nLong story short: that flight was cancelled for operational reasons as Kenya Airways said, the notification likely ended up in the SPAM as I never got it. The airline did not send out any SMS (that would come with a failure of delivery if not received) despite my number on record and permission to contact via phone. Hence I noticed the change 1 day in advance when checking the flight. More so, Kenya Airways had changed our booking to a flight next morning, despite an evening option available. Now, it’s not hard to guess that this would cause issues because barely any traveler, business or personal, does NOT have a booked agenda in post-Corona times. The other evening flight option however was fully booked by the time the problem was noticed as it turned out. Result: a lost expensive overnight stay in Stone town, and a dinner with friends.\nOnce arrived at the Airport on the original departure day, the customer service agent of Kenya Airways at the airport was extremely arrogant and very commanding as if the entire issue was our fault. Absolute exceptionally bad experience here on top of our interrupted vacation. While we did receive an voucher for overnight stay in Nairobi, the entire action and communication around it was not acceptable. I have Senator Status with LH and do fly quite a bit. Things go wrong and did so for me too, but this attitude of an Airline employee was new to us.\n\nKenya Airline declines responsibility despite the change for operational reasons and keeps sending me articles of the policy to say they don’t pay. Due to pre-booking, no refund for the lost stay by the hotel in Stone town or my travel agency and despite all bells and whistles in my travel insurance: if it is not force majeure but due the Airline's changes, the Airline is responsible. No travel insurance would apparently ever pay here.\n\nSo to all travelers: pay attention here, there is many other airlines I know with a lot better customer service and much more flexible policies when it comes down to issue. Everyone can do great when there is no problem, the value of an Airline shows when problems come up. The entire behavior of Kenya Airlines and in particular the customer service agent on top of all the hassle anyway is just totally unacceptable. This was the first and for sure last time. At least in and around Kenya and Tanzania try Precision Air as an alternative. As I still believe the originator of the problem will have to bear the consequences, I will continue and pursue ways to get my refund.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UWadlinger","crvsd":"UWadlinger wrote a review Oct 2022","ui_header_link":"UWadlinger","default":"Frankfurt, Germany","phmbo":"36 contributions","phmbo1":"16 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r863820469-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"When it comes to problems, the \"real service\" and quality shows","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Not sure what this offered  as it was still cramped and uncomfortable.  As it was chilly I had to ask for a blanket.  The entertainment system wasn’t fully functioning so I was relieved that I had my iPad.  We were served a breakfast…….overcooked egg, sloppy spinach and tomato with a stale bread roll.  4 hours on, when no drinks had been offered I began to feel dehydrated so rang the bell 3 times.  Eventually a stewardess attended and I asked were they going to serve drinks as I felt dehydrated.  She came back with a juice.  I then asked twice for a lager.  The steward looked at his watch and after a little while brought me one.  A few more hours went by and a packet of nuts was given out with a drink.  Since we had been on the plane for hours this was something.  Over Italy we were served a luke warm chicken dish which normally I would have returned but I could have eaten a scabby horse so picked through it.

Worst than the delay is the lack of public information telling us about the situation and updates. There is not even a word of apology.

The next leg was from Amsterdam to Nairobi followed by an onward leg to Dar Es Salaam. We were assured on more than one occasion that our luggage would go straight through from Heathrow to Dar Es Salaam. on arrival we went to collect our luggage only to be told it was still in Nairobi, eventually we managed to speak to a manager over the phone who told us our luggage would be sent out on the next plane and assured us it would be sent to our hotel which it did at 21:30, during that time we spent the day in our hotel room in the clothes we had been in since leaving home.\nWe left Dar Es Salaam early next morning for our safari holiday.\nHoliday over and at Dar Es Salaam airport for our return flights this time to Nairobi then straight through to Heathrow. The Business class lounge was clean and well run, a chap by the name of Dough is worth a mention he was polite, helpful and did everything to ensure we were looked after.\nThe leg from Dar Es Salaam to Nairobi was quite short and went without a hitch.\n\nThe lounge in Nairobi was extremely poor, the food was low standard and running out , one passenger asked if there was more food coming and was shouted at saying \"it's coming man\" , I think the passenger was in shock As so was I, he wished me good luck and walked off.\nLounge tables were left uncleaned and dirty crockery from other passengers not cleared.\nWhile in the lounge I took a shower to freshen up, the towel given to me was worn out and covered in holes and the water didn't regulate so I had a cold shower.\nWe boarded our aircraft for our final leg to the UK, not long after takeoff we were given breakfast, a little better than what you would expect in economy but not good enough for business class, this was really the last time we saw a stewardess until lunch which was no better, as they drew the curtains and stayed behind them, as we were just behind the bulk head, I did notice a stewardess through the curtain flossing her teeth.\nNot once did anyone come around and offer water or a drink even though it was a long journey.\nThe toilets were not kept cleaned and the floors wet, there were also passengers coming through the business class from economy to use the toilets without being stopped, I don't want to sound snobby but this is what we pay a lot extra for.\nThe entertainment was also poor, no games and the films and programmes very old.\nWe have travelled on several business class airlines and none as bad as this, not even a smile from the disinterested staff.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2114OFpeterk","crvsd":"Peter K wrote a review Sep 2022","ui_header_link":"Peter K","default":"","phmbo":"15 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Dar es Salaam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r861527851-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Worst ever","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Right before boarding, a Kenya airways staff who made the announcement as to boarding by name Elizabeth M. literally pushed me back with her arms after she had called for boarding by persons with seat numbers 28-33. I went forward and she pushed me back. She was rude and condescending and contrary to their own policy about masking, chose to speak to us without wearing one. I reported with her full name to the cabin crew. A push may be an accident of assault and that is unspeakable behaviour by an airline staff to a customer or anyone else.\n\nThe cabin crew on the other hand, were exceptional at their job and made the flight a great experience for everyone. They were attentive, made sure everyone was comfortable and well catered for and very courteous. Prince Otieno, Lilian and the rest of the crew on flight KQ 508 flying from Nairobi to Accra yesterday the 21st of July, 2022, you are the real pride of Africa.

The KLM Crown Lounge is also a lovely place to relax before the flight. However, the boarding process in Amsterdam was chaos. Sky priority protocols were thrown out of the window by the KLM ground staff and when asked why, the boarding agent rudely replied that they don’t have priority boarding for this specific flight. Fortunately a manager appeared and made some effort to provide a better service to the passengers at the gate.\n\nOnce onboard, the service was great. The plane is modern 787 Dreamliner and the cabin was super clean. Crew were friendly an attentive, the food out of Amsterdam was not the greatest for business class and the champagne had run out after the first welcome drinks. The return flight from Nairobi had a far superior meal service on the other hand. Seats are in 2-2-2 configuration which provides a huge amount of space. Unfortunately this layout is now dated when compared to AF/KL’s 1-2-1 layout on this route which offers direct aisle access for all J seats.\n\nIn Nairobi we transferred to a Precision Air flight down to Kilimanjaro. The experience was seamless and we even had time to visit the Pride Lounge which had an excellent breakfast on offer. Ground crew in Nairobi were professional and friendly and made one feel valued. Pity I can’t say the same about the KLM boarding agents in Amsterdam.\n\nAll in all, KQ provides good value for money.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/62/ef/85/caption.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyagero2018","crvsd":"voyager1 wrote a review Jul 2022","ui_header_link":"voyager1","default":"Deventer, The Netherlands","phmbo":"72 contributions","phmbo1":"70 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r848675060-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Enjoyable trip with KQ","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Our routing was Cape Town / Nairobi / Zanzibar and then Zanzibar / Nairobi / Johannesburg / Cape Town. We checked in the night before our flight to Zanzibar and appeared fine. Fortunately, our travel agent was on the ball and checked the flights in the morning and saw that they had changed the flight to Nairobi and we were now going to miss the connection on to Zanzibar. The airline wasn't very helpful but our agent managed to get us on to a Precision Air flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar. There was no message from Kenya airways - apology - change - comment - nothing.\n\nIt meant a whole day in Nairobi instead of a few hours but we made the most of it.\n\nThen when we arrived in Zanzibar, they had lost two of the six bags that we had checked in. In addition, the Kenya Airways check-in in Cape Town had mixed up all of our bags and luggage tags so we had to decipher which bags were lost by deduction. Despite the lady being quite sweet at check-in this was just unprofessional\n\nWe took the approach of chasing Kenya Airways, Precision Air (the last leg), the land agent on Zanzibar (Africa Stay) and ZAT the airport management company in Zanzibar. Of all of those Kenya Airways was the most backward.\n\nKenya Airways had both a web and WhatsApp channel for logging support issues and both were equally useless and there was no coordination between either. Neither gave us any useful information or made any positive contribution to us finding our bags.\n\nEventually Africa Stay and Precision each found and delivered a bag :-) and we got them on Monday after arriving Friday. Kenya Air sent me a message asking me for feedback on their support despite not knowing that the bags had been delivered to us. This was funny.\n\nAgain on our return, we checked in the night before and all was well. At the airport, they handed us boarding passes for the two flights Zanzibar - Nairobi and Nairobi - Johannesburg without saying any word about changes. We happened to check the boarding pass for the gate in Nairobi and my wife noticed that the time on the flight to Jhb was two hours later than scheduled (and on our original boarding passes that we had printed the night before). No acknowledgement from the staff when we dropped our bags. This meant a longer wait in Nairobi and missing our flight back to Cape Town on a different airline.\n\nLastly, every single Kenya Airways flight on the trip left late i.e. even later than the adjusted late time that they had already moved it on the schedule.\n\nClearly, they have very immature processes for operating both their flight schedule and their operations. You may get lucky but based on their 100% failure rate with our flights and luggage I would bet against it.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/46/9c/ef/dale-w.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connecteddale","crvsd":"connecteddale wrote a review Jul 2022","ui_header_link":"connecteddale","default":"Cape Town Central, South Africa","phmbo":"180 contributions","phmbo1":"50 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r847673836-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"No clue how to operate an airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The crew were singing to her offered juice and empty plastic glasses to play with. That made the flight seem to go very quick and got her tired enough to sleep, managed to get 2 hours of sleep and landing time seemed to reach quick.\n\nWhen we reached the opened airplane door the cold Nairobi breeze greeting us, guess what, our pram was on the tarmac waiting for us to pick it up and stroll towards baggage reclaim and immigration no carrying, \"WOW!\" i said to my wife, \"so far so good. now our bags\"\nCleared immigration and we reached baggage carousel already rolling and bags on their way, 10 mins later our bags arrive, 1,2,3,4,5 bags. yup all of them here safe and sound :)\nAs we get the bags on the trolley we here a cheerful \"hello!\" it was on of the cabin crew who kept our baby occupied in the plane. He asked if we were ok and if we needed any help but we were fine, he waved and wished us a good holiday.\n\nOur holiday went great and now we are back and the flight back was equally amazing just sad we were coming back.\n\nI felt KQ deserved a good review after being bombarded with negative reviews which I truly understand and I consider myself lucky, just credit when its due.\n\nHopefully KQ stays afloat and managed with care and love and looking after the employees as i feel its still truly the \"Pride of Africa\"\n\nMy only criticism will be the inflight meal, no sukuma banaaaa lol","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigmo99","crvsd":"biGmo99 wrote a review Jul 2022","ui_header_link":"biGmo99","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"3 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r847316772-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Pleasantly surprised.","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I checked in three hours before the flight, they couldn't find my ticket in their system, despite the email confirmation I was showing them on my phone.  They were questioning whether I had bought my ticket from a legitimate source; I bought it directly from the airline. After quite some time, they sent me up stairs to the office where the staff called the call center who also could not find my ticket, the excuse being that it was not issued properly.  Supposedly they were fixing it and I was sent down to the ticket counter so I didn't not get stuck at secruity, since my flight was soon to board.  I waited even longer at the ticket counter again.  There were at least 4 other customers on this one flight who were also experiencing issues from no tickets despite purchase to no record of payment for baggage fees etc.  Every one had emails and reciepts of proof but since it wasn't in their system, they acted like there was nothing to do.  One woman had to pay her baggage fees again just to make the flight.Boarding time had started and I was panicking because I had to connect with three more flights to get home to the US.  Eventually someone told me they flight was delayed but not by how much.  When my ticket finally came through,  they offered no support in getting through passport control or security.  By this time, it seemed that the gate would be closing prior to departure before I could get there.  I did manage to get through before they started boarding but no one had the decency to let me know that I still had a bit of time.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieFox","crvsd":"LFox wrote a review Jul 2022","ui_header_link":"LFox","default":"","phmbo":"3 contributions","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Entebbe - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r846533945-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Terrible service--very stressful","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

First, they cancelled a flight I was booked on to Mt Kilimanjaro from Nairobi on June 19th (ticket purchased in March).  I get these days with COVID cancellations happen.  However, I received ZERO email notification that my flight was cancelled.   They automatically booked me on a flight the following day.   Had I not bothered to check the flight details on the Prepare For Your Trip email they did sent, I would have never noticed.   This would have completely ruined my Safari itinerary, so I had to cancel that ticket (of course Kenya Airway kept $100 as a cancellation penalty), and booked a flight with Safarilink (much more reliable).  I thought this might have been a fluke incident, but I am now writing this as I had the exact same situation happen to me on a flight I booked from Mombasa to Nairobi.   What would have been a several hour layover in Nairobi has now been cut down to where I will have to scramble to connect to my flight to London if any sort of delay occurs.   Again, Kenya Airways will send you all sorts of emails to upsell/upgrade but cannot have the common courtesy to send you an email indicating a flight has been canceled and giving you options for other flights.I’ve tried to contact them via phone, even my hotel has tried, and they cannot get anyone on the phone numbers and provided on their own emails.  This is my second time to Africa.  I love Africa.  However, and I hate saying it, every time when people ask me about Africa I tell them about TIA (This Is Africa), and be prepared for it.

We booked roundtrip direct flights to Mauritius to and from Nairobi for our honeymoon. We planned to spend 7 days in Mauritius. The night before our flight from Nairobi to Mauritius, I was emailed (yes, emailed) at 11:19pm while I was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 1:00pm to 7:30am. As I was understandably sleeping at the time, I did not review this message until I woke up at 5:30am that morning. I was staying in Naivasha, Kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport. We immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time. I would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time (for a now 7:30am flight) is insufficient notice. Even after speaking to multiple different Kenya Airways employees, I was never given a reason for the flight time change (just \"operations\"). Ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day, but this was an indirect flight through Dubai, which didn't leave until 5:10pm and involved >16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight. Because of this, we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning, exhausted, having been traveling all night and transferring in Dubai in the middle of the night. To boot, the behavior of the passengers on the plane from Nairobi to Dubai was absurd. People were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants. Kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times. In the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones. To top it all off, in addition to missing our first night of the trip, Kenya Airways also changed our return flight time, moving it up from 7:10pm to 1:40pm. This effectively compromised two different days of our trip (as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel). On top of it all, our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time, longer than it has ever taken for any other flight I have been on. We had all of our documents and it still took us >10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk. Bottom line, if you can avoid it, do NOT fly on Kenya Airways. You will absolutely regret it. We contacted customer service multiple times and they have absolutely refused to make amends or compensate us in any way for destroying our honeymoon.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arwilmington","crvsd":"arwilmington wrote a review Jul 2022","ui_header_link":"arwilmington","default":"Chicago, Illinois","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Mahebourg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r845595636-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Missed Two Days of My Honeymoon","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Pre-departure tests are no longer needed upon arrival to England. However, my instinct told me to check if I needed a PCR to transit through Kenya. The COVID information on the Kenya Airways website is extremely misleading. When I filled in all the details about my trip, it said nothing about a PCR test; however, when I spoke to an agent on WhatsApp they said I need a PCR test as I am not vaccinated (screenshots attached). Having to rush around Lusaka the day before I flew to London, I eventually got a PCR test.\n\nI arrived at Lusaka Airport at 23:30 on Sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 01:10 on Monday (5 minutes before baggage drop off closes) due to the airline and staff's poor customs. I knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack. I was told that I cannot pay using card and can only pay in Kwacha or US Dollar. I had £100, which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether I could pay using British Pounds and inform me. The ATM I was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and I had to run to the domestic airport (10 minutes from the international airport if you're in shape) to withdraw cash from the second nearest ATM. The total amount was 2066 Kwacha and when I presented 2100 Kwacha, I was told they did not have any change...\n\nIf you are travelling to Southern Africa, Ethiopian Airlines is a much better airline (THEY ACCEPT CARD PAYMENT) and I can see why more people prefer them over Kenya Airways.

I had never flown with them before and chose them solely on their price point. They were the lowest other than Qatar Airlines, who I swore off several years ago after the worst flying (or possibly any) experience of my life #fyreflight. Anyway, my first impression was after my husband and I sprinted to make it to the gate and they waved at us to slow down and that it was okay and we made it etc. the kindness and understanding and congeniality shown was top tier. From when we boarded to landing, the service was impeccable. Served us extra wine and extra food (which were both surprisingly high quality).

They delayed my flight 2.5 hours, so I missed all of my connecting flights to get back home to Washington DC. Then I was stuck in Nairobi for 24 hours, just to find out that they are now refusing to pay for my flight to Washington DC and they will only pay to fly me to Amsterdam (which was just the connection flight, I have no other reason to go there). After flying to Amsterdam, they told me that I had to pay for a completely new ticket out-of-pocket to get back to DC, even though the only reason I missed my original flight was because of Kenya Airways delays. All of the flights besides one were over €1700, so I had to book a €570 ticket through Turkey and Munich which added another 30 hours to my trip on top of the 12 hours waiting in Amsterdam between flights and the 24 hours in nairobi. On top of that, they did not send my luggage to Amsterdam, so I had to report my luggage as lost. I wish I was making this up. If their flights were on-time (or if they at LEAST paid for the next flight to DC), then this could’ve been handled so much better.\n\nBut for me to just get home (because of Kenya Airways delays that caused me to miss my connecting flights):\n- took me 3.5 days (82 hours total)\n- lost all of my luggage\n- had to pay €570 out-of-pocket for a new ticket even though they were at fault for the delays and therefore the missed connecting flights\n\nI would rather walk through the Sahara Desert, with honor, before I step foot on a Kenya Airways flight again. I have literally never written a bad online review before, but this airline is almost impressively horrific so I felt the responsibility of warning you all. It seems as though they did everything in their power to screw up everything. I’ve flown Ryanair around a dozen times and they can be late quite often, but Kenya Airways is run by the most clueless muppets on the planet.\n\nI am convinced that Kenya has the best marathon runners because they arrive faster by running than flying. I seriously wish this was a joke, but I really had to share thus truth as a warning.

The 2 aircrafts were both B737-800s in very good condition. I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 Minutes online - and was even free as it was a “Business Light” ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard, champagne, and my beloved seafood hot meal, which KQ still offers (even in economy) in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as “dietary reasons” to order. Luggage delivered quickly and in good order. Good value for money – will fly with them again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp","crvsd":"Anders P P wrote a review May 2022","ui_header_link":"Anders P P","default":"","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Monrovia - Kigali","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r839221896-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Wonder about the many poor reviews?","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. KQ staff came to me in lounge and, without request, carried my hand-luggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years.\n\nPearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways.\n\nFirst flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely, roomy aircraft. Onboard, they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakingly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice - it would have costed me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate KQ often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in mini-bottles was acceptable, a South African “Stonedale”. I had requested seafood meal and I got it: it was a cold, tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue.\n\nTransit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge, roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections. Had a god nights’ sleep after acquainting myself with a Niederburg rose-wine which superseded an alternative, Italian sparkling wine\n\nThe next flights from Nairobi to Monrovia via Accra were on their B737-800. Despite the flight was completely full (all seats taken in both classes!) the staff manage to care passengers well. No power outlet nor monitors, only WiFi and use of personal devices were possible. Special meal rendered to perfection. I also tried other dishes as I was offered. Drinks provided generously, again Happy Hour (order 1 get 2) occurred at least once. Slight delay as the stop-over in Accra took longer time as a lot of passengers disembarked before cleaning and loads of new passengers came on board – again the flight was full. Luggage in Monrovia came out quickly. Nicely done, Kenya Airways. Can recommend.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp","crvsd":"Anders P P wrote a review May 2022","ui_header_link":"Anders P P","default":"","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - Monrovia","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r837885755-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Solid airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The dinner was a Turkey roll which was absolutely dry and the bun was not fresh. Breakfast was sausages and potatoes. The most painful 14hrs of my life. The movies on board are truly the worst.

Although three managers later and a whole lot of lies he accepted responsibility for Kenya Airways for allwoing me on the flight to Kenya and he would HELP me by telling to to go to the Canadian Embassy to get  anew passport as NO country will allow me entry and that was his way of reconciling their msitake. BUT YET how could I go to an embassy if NO country will allow me entry... DONT FLY WITH KENYA AIRWAYS ... THEY LIE and stick to the slimmest of rules and say they did their job...

Like many people, we had to reschedule our June 2020 trip due to COVID. We were offered a voucher to be used the following year. Great, so far so good. When I went to rebook the same flight from and to the same destinations, the prices MORE THAN DOUBLED! What???!!!??? So I asked for a refund instead. All within the guidelines. Then it really all fell apart.\n\nSince I paid for our tickets via a wire transfer instead of a credit card (never doing that again!) I was on my own to get a refund. I asked for a refund on 2/9/2021. After a year, and just shy of 100 emails, and 7 phone calls that I got hung up on when I asked for them to clarify, I finally got my refund. Today. 2/22/2022. Over a year!\n\nI ended up having to threaten legal action after seeing an internal email that I shouldn't have seen. They stated that their \"empty promises have lost their effect.\" That I \"needed to be managed.\" That \"the customer has no idea of the word patience.\" This was quite upsetting! They had just over $9000 of MY money and were trying to screw me out of all of it.\n\nBuyer beware. This was the worst travel experience of my life.\n\nHowever, we ended up going anyways using Delta and were treated well. The cost was only slightly higher due to stopping in Paris on the way there, but not enough to make the trip a no go.\n\nI've been waiting to write this for some time.

However, my multiple experiences with this airline have been even worse than expected.\n\nIn brief, the most serious problem stems from the customer service if you live in the USA. When you call, you wait a long time. Then, it is very rare that the person you talk to has the authority/ability/training to do anything you are requesting. Oftentimes, they say a supervisor will call you back. Trust me, they never will!\n\nWhen you attempt to send emails to guest support or customer service there is a small probability you will ever hear back from them. I'm not confident they even look at the emails.\n\nIn one experience on a flight they double booked/double charged me, I made no less than 30 phone calls and sent no less than 25 emails. The result? Absolutely nothing!\n\nNaturally, I would recommend avoiding this airline altogether. However, due to limited flight options in Africa, many times you have no choice in the matter.\n\nHere a five tips:\n1. If possible, always pick a European airline when coming into the Continent; never choose Kenya Airways unless it is the last option.\n2. While in Africa, recognize that Kenya Airways is actually better than many of the other African airlines. This is hard to believe, but true. Here are the airlines in Africa that are better if you have the option: RwandAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and South African Airways.\n3. If you a book a ticket for Kenya Airways, always do so on a 3rd party site (American Express, Expedia, etc.). Even though this sounds counterintuitive, there are oftentimes significant problems with the Kenya Airways payment website. In fact, I once had a situation where I bought a ticket on Kenya Airways website, and then discovered additional charges on my credit card saying, \"Kenya Airways.\" It turned out that a scam artist was stealing information from Kenya Airways and actually using the name, \"Kenya Airways.\" Obviously, this is a real problem!\n4. If you have a problem and need to make a change or seek a refund, don't waste much time on the matter. If they offer you a refund with a 40% cancellation fee, take it immediately (even if it makes no sense and isn't fair)! Take whatever you can get but be prepared to get nothing.

Small salad starter, a roll and a small portion main course of either fish, chicken or vegetarian pasta. All the food was completely tasteless with no flavour and very dry. This applied to any of the selections.

Buffet breakfast offerings are weird (baked beans, rubbery chunks of cheap frankfurters and pieces of cold spinach omelette). Last time, buffet was closed, the staff said it was table service only. I asked for a plate of fruit, 2 fried eggs and bacon and “anything else hot”. I told the waiter that I only had 20 minutes before boarding call. There were only 5 people in the lounge, including me. After 15 minutes and some nagging, I got a plate of baked beans and a piece of cold omelette! No fruit. That came later (after more nagging). There was no hot water for a cup of tea (had to nag). Eggs never arrived. She was sweet - not her fault that everything was substandard - but she was obviously getting pressure from the other 4 travelers for better service too and could barely keep up. This is not of international standards and much below expectations for business class travellers.\n\nCome on Kenya Airways - you can do better than this at relatively small cost.\n\nTempted to switch to BA (who have unapologetically downgraded me twice so hard to forgive) but I’ve always been loyal to KQ and enjoy their warm, humorous on-board service.\n\nImprove Simba Lounge!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salmwood","crvsd":"Sally Woodcock wrote a review Dec 2021","ui_header_link":"Sally Woodcock","default":"Gilgil, Kenya","phmbo":"53 contributions","phmbo1":"41 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - London","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r821012021-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Business Class Lounge much below standard","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Then three days later I was automatically charged again for each of the two tickets!  BUT the provisional charge of nearly £1,000 was never reversed.  This 'provisional' charge means you cannot access your £1,000.  It effectively comes out of your account for 31 days.  I spoke to the bank who issued the card I used.  They were helpless to do anything for 31 days unless Kenya Airways issued a reversal of the 'provisional payment'.

However, I found almost none of the negative reviews to be true.\n\nFirst off the check in process online and in person was easier than my experience with even some US airlines. I was able to check in online and then at the check in counter at JFK (where there was absolutely no line) the attendant was able to \"upgrade\" my wife and I to an exit row for no additional charge (whereas on the website this was an additional fee. My one complaint about the seat selection process is that It's pretty unclear what paying more for a seat really gets you. Either way, i'd recommend doing it at the counter. Also - I used their whatsapp number to try and attempt to upgrade to business class and was communicating with a real person!\n\nThe flight itself was fairly empty, perhaps 60% to capacity. Overall I thought the plane was very spacious, clean and the service was excellent. They were cleaning the bathrooms frequently and refilling drinks without even asking. Overall the food was fine... nothing to go crazy about, but it was pretty much what you'd expect with economy airline food (chicken or pasta).\n\nI will say, as many of the other reviews have noted, the entertainment system was pretty sub par. They had a few great movies, and not the most intuitive UI. I did also find it bizarre there wasn't even an option for wifi.. it's slightly old school, just download stuff in advance! The seat itself also didn't have the best lumbar support, I used the pillow they gave you for added support and brought a head pillow.\n\nOur final destination was JRO with a 3 hour layover in Nairobi. Overall our journey was about 16 ish hours, FAR LESS than some of the other options with Qatar, KLM etc. which are all great airlines, but I do value time (and saving money), so I thought this was a great overall option for someone going on Safari in Kenya and/or Tanzania. I'd do it again for sure.\n\nNot a knock on Kenya Airways, but the NBO airport is pretty poor, i'd recommend going to the lounge if your credit card or status gives you lounge access. We paid $40 a piece to sit in there for 2.5 hours which was fine, but not one of the better lounges I have seen.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/88/03/d2/james-a.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMrJames","crvsd":"TheMrJames wrote a review Oct 2021","ui_header_link":"TheMrJames","default":"New York City, New York","phmbo":"12 contributions","phmbo1":"13 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r814605873-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"JFK > NBO Dreamliner","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had an issue with my Covid test (did it too  early so it would have expired by the time I got to Ghana). The whole situation was such a mess, I was certain that I would not be able to fly. Lydia advised me that there was a quick testing station outside (which obviously required me to pay an arm and a leg because these Covid test fees are a scam. I digress). She waited for me until the last minute to get my results so she could get my bag checked-in. When I was running between the testing station and the check-in counter, she decided that I could leave my bag there (I was literally the only remaining customer, so she was just being kind) and took my number so I could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter. She did call me, and while I was running a few minutes late, she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and I could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through. Lydia was probably the most helpful and noncynical airport person I'd ever met. While some of her colleagues were annoyed with my situation and essentially had given up on me, she endeavoured to help me well beyond her call of duty. This is the kind of South Africa I know - one filled with ubuntu, while acting within the confines of professional conduct. Lydia didn't break any rules or try to cut be some slack because that would have been unethical and against her professional conduct. Instead, she humanized herself and just literally did what most of us would do for each other on the daily. She didn't become clinical or inhumane simply because she was at work - she was both kind and professional. We need more Lydia's at the airport!!!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandisiweeletuy","crvsd":"Sandisiwe Eletu Y wrote a review Sep 2021","ui_header_link":"Sandisiwe Eletu Y","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Accra","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r810846488-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The service desk support worker for Kenyan Airways in Joburg by the name of Lydia is a rockstar!!!","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

With that out of the way let's begin.       If you live in the USA, you are probably planning your once in a lifetime safari vacation via Kenya Airways direct flight from JFK to Nairobi, and you have noticed the cheap price. You're probably thinking \"how bad can it be?\". Let me tell you.      Our adventure started two years ago as we planned our trip to Uganda and Kenya.  We were to fly to Nairobi from JFK, then transfer to Entebee. After our Uganda safari we would fly back to Nairobi and do a short Kenya safari before flying home. Like most travellers, COVID ruined our 2020 plans. Kenya Airways offered vouchers, again like most airlines. Now the fun began. There website does not show a US phone number, but I found one and used it, but most of the time they either didn't pick up or you were put on hold until you had to give up and get on with your life. The website did have a online chat with a type to an agent option. The chat would start with KA writing you are in third position approximate wait 15 minutes, after an hour you would be in first position and get a message \"all our agents are busy please try later. At times I even emailed guest services, after a few days I sometimes got a response. At one point I gave in and phoned the Nairobi office, there I got a response and $30 phone bill. Eventually I got everything in place, including what the call premium economy. Premium economy cost  a $150 dollars a seat extra and got you the front row of economy with no one in the middle seat of there 3-3-3 set up. On the flight to Nairobi I asked if they had any available business class left, they did and at a reasonable price I upgraded. Nobody can screw up business class, so we had a nice flight to Nairobi. My only complaint, and slight is that the entertainment package was pretty bad. Their showcase movies was stuff I saw  six months or a year ago on HBO.        Now for the flight home. We arrived at the airport 3.5 hours early, after all things get slow because of COVID precautions. KA booked their flights to New York and Paris fifteen minutes apart. As a result you had around 700 people checking in at four check-in desks. Not exactly a safe way to check people in at this time. When we got to the check-in desk, I asked if they had anything available in business and was told it was a completely sold out.  My wife and I at least were comforted with the fact we would get the front row of economy with the middle seat empty.. When we got on the plane, we approached our seats and guess what: the middle seats had people in them.  We took our narrow hard seats, that were better than Frontier airlines seats, but nowhere as good as a Southwest Airlines seat. From there we started our 14 hour flight home, where we were served horrible food (even by airlines standards), with the old fashioned two prong earphones in which you ad to install the pads on the earphones by yourself. The little amenities you usually find on long haul flights like a small personal care kit were available only in business class. The only fortunate part of the flight is that it took off at midnight, so we somehow slept through half the torture.       So let me sum up. You are probably looking forward to a trip of a lifetime, and it's one pretty penny. Pay a little extra and find another airline. If your safari doesn't start in Kenya, you are going to transfer anyway so don't be lured by the direct flight. If you don't heed my advice and have the same type of trip that I and other reviewers speak of, you can't say you weren't warned.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bschoenb","crvsd":"bschoenb wrote a review Aug 2021","ui_header_link":"bschoenb","default":"Smithtown, New York","phmbo":"180 contributions","phmbo1":"80 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r805648354-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"WARNING DON'T FLY","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They will cancel flights at the last minute without ever even notifying the passengers who are planning to go back to home in Africa.. Their website CLEARLY says they will decide to cancel their own flights which alone speaks to the magnitude of a airline of themselves and it says they will provide notifications and they've cancelled my flight three times and they've NEVER notifying me. They told me they would put me on June 8th instead I said ok suddenly they're cancelling it until the 9th and I can't know that checking online even though I had to sleep inside of the airport. I have not showered, eaten, or seen a bed for over three days because of this insolence. I was taken to the police station to be documented because I'm just walking around in this country and I've told them everything they do not care they won't even give me a food Vouchers after cancelling three flights and now without even eating they expect that I will be able to do another covid test by myself when I don't even have money to contact me family with my cell phone. Do not ever use them! The first thing they told me was after cancelled at airport that I would have to pay the changes because their employees are liars then someone else took my last 45 dihrams I can do anything and I might go to jail and be stuck in this country FOREVER because of this so called company keeps on cancelling because \"NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE ON THE FLIGHT\" SO the bottom line is money but I paid my ticket cost!!!!!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitneyl795","crvsd":"Whitney L wrote a review Jun 2021","ui_header_link":"Whitney L","default":"Atlanta, Georgia","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Dubai - Accra","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r791702089-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"NEVER use this airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This most recent time, of which I am currently on hold with the airline for hour 3, leaves me with absolutely no other flight to go to my destination. Nothing. And as I have tried to rebook both on the webchat (another three hours to have the genius-level employee say the flight is indeed cancelled) and rebook through my very, very ... very long phone call with them, the service is so poor, so unimaginably poor that I have to wonder, is this even a real airline? Come to think of it, I have not seen a Kenyan air flight myself. I've seen pictures of an airplane marked Kenya air, but...that could be photoshopped in like ten minutes.

We have a booked and paid for trip which we had to rebook due to covid-19 in 2020. Our trip is expected to be this April(2021), and we had supposedly received our cancelled flights in the form of a refunded 'voucher' which was never ever received from the airline. We then received (on Christmas Eve) a link to our supposedly 'new flights' which had a time frame to a payment portal from 15h00-17h30/18h00 roughly... let me reiterate, on Christmas Eve, who is checking their emails to rebook flights in such a short time frame?\nWe then tried to access the portal that night at 19h00 and we could not access it to pay an additional fee (when this was supposed to be fully refunded I might add) for our flights in April.\nI have sent roughly 50 emails to the airline, and that doesn't include my partners emails to #KenyaAirways. We have heard nothing back from them, and they have about R35 000 of our money in promised refunded tickets which we do not have and cannot get hold of anybody from Kenya Airways. This is beyond unprofessional and I have literally tried to contact any/everyone I possibly could from Kenya Airway.

I travel often and today I landed in Nairobi from Kisumu with KQ only to find my suitcase was opened unknowingly. I have a blue padlock and a key marked with the same colour. I reported that the padlock on this bag was not mine.The fake padlock replaced could be opened with any key. Inside my suitcase,all the items were haphazardly arranged and it was clear someone opened the suitcase. This claims were met with defense from a security person from the airline saying it is impossible for that to happen. I had personal belongings in this suitcase with no money or electronics which were in my boarding luggage.

This is misleading and deceitful!\n\nInitial flights booked online with Kenya Airways on 18/10/2020 by credit card\n\nFlights Details:\nKilimanjaro to Nairobi Flight KQ427 19th December\nNairobi to Dubai Flight KQ304 19th December\nDubai to Nairobi Flight KQ305 4th January\nNairobi to Kilimanjaro Flight KQ0426 4th January\n\nOn the 7/12/2020, I filled in an online support to seek confirmation that the flights would go ahead and I received an automated response to confirm that the flights would still go ahead, which was untruthful on the part of Kenya Airways.\n\nOn the 15th December, we received an email from Kenya Airways Arusha Office to inform us that Flight KQ427 from Kilimanjaro to Nairobi on 19th December had been cancelled and that we were going to be redirected via Dar Es Salam and had to take Flight PW0431 with Precision Air from Kilimanjaro to Dar Es Salam. She sent us new tickets by email but for some reason, issued new tickets with different Booking Reference Numbers.\n\nFlight details:\nKilimanjaro to Dar Es Salam Flight PW0431 19th December\nDar Es Salam to Nairobi Flight KQ0485 19th December\nNairobi to Dubai Flight KQ304 19th December\n\nDubai to Nairobi Flight KQ305 4th January\nNairobi to Kilimanjaro Flight KQ0426 4th January\n\nOn the 18th December, one day before our journey, we received an automated email to inform us that Flight KQ 304 from Nairobi to Dubai on the 19th December had been cancelled and that we were rebooked onto Flight KQ 304DE on 20th December at 6:05 instead but we received no updated tickets. We were then sent an automated email message that my wife was now booked onto an Emirates flight EK 722 that evening but no information about my son or me. I attempted to seek help on the online via the Kenya Airways site but nobody replied to us to check if we had all been booked on to the Emirates flight but nobody replied. New tickets were not emailed to us either, so we were left confused as to which flights we were now supposed to take from Nairobi to Dubai.\n\nOur Experience on the 19th December 2020 - Outward Journey:\n\nAt Check-in for Precision Air Flight, we were informed by the check-in member of staff that my wife's flight ticket had been exchanged but that they had not received the new ticket from Kenya Airways on their system, so she could not fly. Precision Air staff manged to make contact with Kenya Airways and it was eventually sorted.\n\nIn Dar Es Salam, we managed to speak to a member of staff at the Kenya Airways sales office at Terminal 3 to try to confirm our flights from Nairobi to Dubai and that we were all still booked on the same flight as a family. She was very unhelpful and said that she could not help us, despite the fact we were now booked on different flights. She said that we had to proceed on the next leg of our journey to Nairobi and seek help at the transfer desk in Nairobi.\n\nOn arrival in Nairobi, we proceeded to the transfer desk and the member of staff was helpful. She removed my wife from the Emirates flight and rebooked my wife back to the morning flight, so that we could travel together as a family. The member of staff was very helpful, organised us a transit visa and a hotel room for a few hours before the morning flight to Dubai. We simply do not understand why my wife's flight was changed and not my son and mine without even asking us, informing us properly or even sending us any updated tickets?\nThe morning flight from Nairobi to Dubai was a very pleasant flight!\n\nOn the 25th December, we finally received a Guest Support Response from Faith Mutuku from Kenya Airways regarding our outward journey but by that time, we had arrived in Dubai.\n\nOn the 1st January 2021, I received an email with a new Electronic ticket for the Return Flights but no new tickets were sent for my wife or my son. I replied to the email to request new updated tickets were emailed but we received no reply and no new tickets for them\n\nOur Experience on the 4th December 2020 - Return Journey.\n\nWe proceeded to Dubai airport for our flights from Dubai to Nairobi and Nairobi to Dar Es Salam and there were no problems despite the fact we had no new tickets for my wife or son. Both were pleasant flights.\n\nWe were informed at Check-in at Dubai airport that our bags would be checked in all the way to Kilimanjaro airport. This was NOT the case. On arrival at Dar Es Salam, our bags were left unattended by the conveyer belt, so we collected them. It is fortunate that we spotted them!\n\nOn check-in for our Precision Air Flight PW0438 from Dar Es Salam to Kilimanjaro, we were informed that they had no updated ticket on their system for my wife and son. They attempted to contact Kenya Airways by phone but nobody replied. I went to seek help from the Kenya Airways desk in Terminal 3 but it was closed. I asked the Service desk in Terminal 3 to help. She managed to get a male Kenya Airways staff member on the phone and I spoke to him. He did not want to help and provided me with another number to call (+255 786390002). We tried to call the new number many times and nobody answered. We also tried to call the Arusha Office number but nobody answered. Kenya Airways was uncontactable and there was nobody to offer help! Kenya Airways had left my wife Stephanie and son Alex stranded in Dar Es Salam with no way to get to Kilimanjaro Airport. This is unacceptable!\n\nWe were left in a desperate situation, so we went back to Precision Air to see if they could help us. They said that in order to fly, we would need to purchase new tickets for my wife and son and claim a refund for the flights from Kenya Airways. We had no choice but to purchase new tickets so they could fly from Dar Es Salam to Kilimanjaro despite the fact we had already bought and paid for tickets with Kenya Airways! This is absolutely disgraceful on the part of Kenya Airways!\n\nWe purchased two tickets for my wife and son at a cost of TZS 319,780 each person, a total of TZS 639, 560, which we want refunded immediately.\n\nOur initial flights which we booked were from Kilimanjaro to Dubai via Nairobi and Kenya Airways had a responsibility and duty of care to make sure we got to our destination. They did not honour the tickets or flights that we had booked.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/d7/13/00/visitcamborne.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmejkalIJ","crvsd":"Ian wrote a review Jan 2021","ui_header_link":"Ian","default":"Moshi, Tanzania","phmbo":"46 contributions","phmbo1":"22 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kilimanjaro National Park - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r780584726-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Flight cancellations & constant changes and left stranded!!","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We all know that, but if we all stopped traveling then companies like Kenya Airways would not be able to make any money at all. So when they mess up and misinform their customers, they should take responsibility for their mistakes. Instead, I have phone their customer helpline three times and rather than elevate my complaint to a manager so that they can deal with it, they have hung up on me three times (so far). I have also left my number with their manager (John) so that he can call me back to deal with my complaint. I was told he'd phone in ten minutes. It's now nearly two hours and he still hasn't called. This is a company that hangs up on you.  I am stuck in Zanzibar with my family, and this is how they are dealing with me. My youngest son was in tears when he heard we couldn't go home.

Due to the Covid situation, we were stranded in India. We were told that our tickets will remain open until February 2021. Once Kenya opened up for tourism, we were able to get a tourist visa. We contacted the India office to assist us with information so we can make the booking without any errors. We were put in touch with Panatta, Seigfred, and Nirmala.\n\nWe were not allowed to use our open tickets because it was apparently a repatriation flight. However, the flight was full of Indian citizens traveling for holiday purposes, some not even holding a visa, yet Panatta was very rude to us and insisted that we must buy fresh tickets (at double the cost of a return ticket), have all our documentation, including a flight back to my home country, even though the regulation is return or onward flight.\n\nThe emails between ourselves and Panatta show that she was not bothered with trying to help but rather actively trying to make it difficult for us to travel. Even after talking to KQ Nairobi and being informed to be ok to take an onward flight to Cairo, Panatta refused and said that we have to buy a flight back to my home country. A 2000 dollars flight. To ensure that it is difficult for us to book this flight, Panatta asked for the return flight to be sent well in advance and to prove that this was not just a reservation but a paid booking. In these uncertain times, how are we supposed to pay for a flight despite not being sure if we will be able to take it?\n\nIf the Kenya side is open for tourism and has given us a visa, and accepted an onward flight, what concern would it be of Panatta's to force us to take a flight we did not want to book?\n\nOn arrival at the Mumbai Airport, the KQ check in desk also denied us boarding on the basis that my flight is booked 90 days from the time of visa application. The visa application clearly states that the application is valid for 3 months and stay in Kenya is valid for 3 months from date of arrival and not date of application. The Kenya Airways staff in India are not polite or professional. Panatta regards herself as the highest authority for KQ in India.\n\nIt is hard to believe that the objective of the staff for the people at the KQ India office is solely to make non Indian's lives harder by being rude and ignorant. We have heard from many other Kenyans, who have had similarly bad experiences with Panatta and her gang. It hurts me to say KQ is no longer the pride of Africa.\n\nFinally, the flight back was a nightmare, the plane was dirty, the seats somehow got smaller, you cannot regulate the AC and the whole flight felt like a sauna. No social distancing or health protocols were followed at any time. They give you a kit and hope for the best. Will not recommend at all. It was a nightmare from start to finish.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nancy12234","crvsd":"Nancy wrote a review Sep 2020","ui_header_link":"Nancy","default":"","phmbo":"21 contributions","phmbo1":"14 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r772340526-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Refusing to issue refunds","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Since we booked in November, this would give us 16 months to use it instead of a year. We felt we had no choice but to take the voucher even though it should have been 2 years from date of departure.Sometime between early June and 6/29 Kenya Airways reinstated the flight.

This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. I had read reports about the service and staff being patchy on this route with travelers left for hours without refreshments or with unfriendly staff but it seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and always had a smile on their faces .... something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet.\n\nCheck in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process.\n\nThe plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was actually really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals.\n\nThe biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed.\n\nIf I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating :\n\n- Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue.\n\nHowever, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had).\n\nWe want to go back to the Seychelles when all this is over but sadly I fear it will need to be with another airline, despite the stellar service of the staff on KQ003 on the day we flew.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/83/3c/37/highlanderict.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HighlanderICT","crvsd":"Scott M wrote a review May 2020","ui_header_link":"Scott M","default":"Toronto","phmbo":"241 contributions","phmbo1":"58 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r753560848-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Cabin Staff were great .... the rest, average!","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Kenya Airways told me not to worry about the luggage transfer. At the time of boarding, sure enough the luggage had not been transferred in spite of the long hours of waiting. The Emirates staff said “Kenya Airways is always slow in responding” and asked me to contact them again to make sure my bags are transferred. The service desk is notoriously overcrowded and understaffed with extreme long waiting time, so I contacted their staff in the business lounge.

Aircrafts E190 on short leg and Boeing Dreamliners B788 on long legs. All flights on time. No luggage issues. Checked in online. Had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure. Upgraded 1st leg KGL-NBO by a modest, but successful online bid. Granted lounge access by courtesy in Nairobi as my Gold Card was just earned during the same trip (but of course not processed in their system). In Kigali they use Pearl lounge which is deteriorating since Rwandair opened a new lounge opposite. Kenya Airways Pride Lounge in Nairobi is wonderful. Food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace. However, drink supplies were fine. I like the “Happy Hours” approach they use on regional routes like to Dubai and JNB where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking. I have only received this double up service before on Gulf Air and the now deceased Jet Airways. That is generous, positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse. FAs are very good though advised an FA to avoid chewing gum as it is cause feeling of disrespect to some passengers. Champagne on business class is good and offered also before departure. No IFE on short legs but on long legs plenty of films to watch. No WiFi onboard.

However the booking experience was very poor - all is handled by an overseas call centre, I had to phone several times and each time was kept on hold for an unacceptable period of time. Of most concern was that I was put on standby for the second part of my flight (Nairobi to London). I had paid full fare 2 months before departure and think a stand-by in mid journey (it is the airlines choice to route all through Nairobi)  was very poor practice and trying to resolve this issue  cost me much of the last day of my holiday.

We stayed overnight in Nairobi to catch our flight to Arusha the day after, a very good idea.  The trip over was just fine, typical care.  The cabin attendants were attentive, the food, surprisingly, acceptable.  The business class seats were flat sleeping beds, but not pods found on other airlines.  I found them perfectly fine, my wife felt the fabric was scratchy, while on other airlines the seats were leather.  We left and arrive virtually on time.  The Nairobi airport is a total BEAR.  I would question using it if we ever chose to return.  It is certainly not disability-friendly.  The return flight was quite an experience.  Thew flight was scehduled to leave at 11 PM, but since we had encountered lots of local traffic in Nairobi that day, we had our driver drop us off at the airport well in advance.  The airport again was a bear.  e went through one security checkpoint just to get to the check in point.  The business class checkin was very difficult to find.  Having cleared that obstacle, we then had to go through secutiry again at the gate, full inspection of carryons and metal detector scanning.  Once in we found that the temperature was too high, as if there was no air conditioning.  Travelling business class we were \"\"invited\" to the airlines \"Pride Club.\"  Initially it felt cooler, there was a nice assortment of food and drink.  Then the electricity faild and the air conditioner never seemed to be effective after that.  After hours in there, we werr told to go to the gate.  My wife had purchased a bottle of water, and had to discr=ard it, since they would not allow it past securtiry, although we had already gone through 2 securities and the water had to be purchased in the terminal.At the gate we sat and waited, and waited.  We did see the crew standing at the gate, but they did not enter the aircraft until the actual estimated time of departure.  We finally enterred and were seated.  We heard some travellers say this flight is always late.  We left almost an hour late.The same situation with the seats as on the way to Nairobi.  Boarding and taking off at midnight, we had no desire for food.  When we awakened, we asked if there were any snacks, to which we were told no, there might be some sandwiches.  A reluctant cabin attendant found us a couple of plain rolls.We went back to sleep and about 2 hours before landing, they brough \"breakfast,\" a choice of rubber egg omelets with some unkown meat or a vegetarian dish with carrots and peas in a red curry sause and some aspict stuff.  We asked for some rolls, and that is what we got, multigrained rolls or white rolls, not normal breakfast type rolls.  I asked if they at least had some dry cereal and was told they never carry it.The flight was fine and we landed 45 minutes later than scheduled.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toxdoc42","crvsd":"toxdoc42 wrote a review Mar 2020","ui_header_link":"toxdoc42","default":"Hilton Head, South Carolina","phmbo":"13 contributions","phmbo1":"11 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r750338978-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Non-Stop JFK to Nairobi","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Without sounding racist, the ALL AFRICAN CREW crew made me proud to support this Airline and certainly dispelled the Myth about African Airlines association with bad service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/d8/74/7c/n1101ayvictors.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1101AYvictors","crvsd":"N1101AYvictors wrote a review Mar 2020","ui_header_link":"N1101AYvictors","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"20 contributions","phmbo1":"13 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Mombasa","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r749390331-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya Airways dispel the Myth and Bad service assumptions","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It has two flights from Mumbai. Economic and moderate services are offered on the flight. It has certainly made an impression on the Indians and hence, their passener count has grown since 2004 - my first ever flight to Africa, via Nairobi.\n\nAll though, Ethiopian, Rwand air, Emirates are giving tough competition to KQ, it has managed to maintain its class.\n\nThe service is fine. Nairobi has been busy lately, hence, keep enough time between the two connections. Unlike Bangkok Airways, they do not offer any lounge services to economy class passengers. And their business class loung does not have anything special. In fact, it remains crowded during early morning peak hours.\n\nPrefer online check in services for quicker access.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/a1/4a/1f/hardiksv.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hardiksv","crvsd":"HARDIK VACHHARAJANI wrote a review Mar 2020","ui_header_link":"HARDIK VACHHARAJANI","default":"Ahmedabad, India","phmbo":"53 contributions","phmbo1":"21 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Lubumbashi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r749217489-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"KQ : Gateway to Africa & beyond","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They create problems without having a way to fix them. My flight through Kenya airways from NBO to SEZ was originally supposed to depart at 12:45pm. Now it’s 2pm and they are saying that my flight from NBO to SEZ is leaving at 17:00 or 5pm. This flight takes at least 3 hours.  The problem is that I booked another flight through Air Seychelles from Mahe Island (SEZ) to Praslin (PRI) that departs at 18:50 or 6:50pm. I checked in for my flight on AirSeychelles on my phone when I landed at NBO. I checked in before Kenya airways told me that my flight would be delayed by 5 hours. As a result of Kenya Airways delay, I am missing a flight that I paid for separately, and essentially Kenya Airways is saying that I will be responsible for the fees involved with missing my Seychelles flight. That includes a no show fee, a rebooking fee and change of reservation fee. So I’m looking at spending an additional $100+ US dollars because Kenya Airways’ flight was delayed almost 5 hours. And Kenya Airways has given me no solution but for me to pay the extra fees and just deal with it.\n\nIn addition, if I can’t get a flight in time, I’m losing the cost of accommodation for my first night which is in Praslin.\n\nThe women at the customer service desk were even more rude. They began looking at us, passing notes and talking in their language, Looking at us again, and then laughing. I don’t see how our distress caused by your airline is a laughing matter. So long as I can help it, I will never fly Kenya Airways again. And unless they are able to resolve this issue, I would recommend that others avoid Kenya Airways at all costs.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenoftrav","crvsd":"Queen wrote a review Feb 2020","ui_header_link":"Queen","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Victoria","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r745638909-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Multiple flight delays - I had to pay extra","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Whilst I was preparing to depart for Zambia I got an urgent request to facilitate another training for the UN IOM Kenya office that was scheduled to start on January 30th from 09.00hrs in Naivasha, which after consultation with my Team, I flatly declined. Then I decided to look for early flights from Lusaka to Nairobi and when I saw one scheduled to depart Lusalka at 02.10hrs to arrive in Nairobi shortly before 06.00hrs I decided to try it. When I floated the idea to my Team, they totally declined terming it suicidal, and they justified it with all sorts of scary stories about KQ being late, cancelling flights and not being reliable. Gosh! I was terrified and convinced that it was suicidal. I prayed over it and decided to take a major risk, which if backfired I was going to not only loose a major reputable client, but also loose my reputation and would even have to end up in Court for breach of contract. It was such a major risk, but I decided to take it anyway and put all my faith on Kenya Airways that I have been flying on for so so many years and had been lucky to have only experienced only two delays. On January 25th at 23:00hrs I took flight KQ 726 seating on my favorite seat 33A at the rear end of the cabin near the wash rooms I hate walking down the aisle from the front to the washrooms. KQ flight 726 departed on schedule with no delay and I took that as a good sign and a good start for by busy super tight itinerary. Got into Lusaka on schedule a night at The Taj Pamodzi departed for Lake Kariba Inns the following day facilitated my training, departed from Kariba on the afternoon of the 29th stayed at the Southern Sun Ridgeway left for the airport at midnight and my heart was beating so fast worrying that this was where it could go so badly wrong if Kenya Airways did not keep time. To my delight KQ 727 Nairobi bound was on time departing at precisely 02.10hrs and arriving in Nairobi almost 10mins earlier than scheduled. My driver to Naivasha was thrilled, and before traffic could build up along the busy Mombasa Road highway, we were on our way along the Southern bypass, arriving at the Great Rift in Naivasha at 08.33hrs. My clients found me completely rested and set for their training. Those among them who knew that I had traveled from Lusaka that same morning could not believe how relaxed I looked. Kudos! Kenya Airways you came through for me at such a critical moment. I chose to trust you literary with my life and you did not disappoint.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/challengecentreken2","crvsd":"Ali Mazoa wrote a review Feb 2020","ui_header_link":"Ali Mazoa","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"32 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Lusaka - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r745161671-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"A wonderful experience!","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Our Office was in touch with Kenya Airways in Delhi, who were the only ones able to tell us about loading of the baggage in the next flight to Nairobi from Mumbai.\n\n\n\nAlthough when we lodged a complaint regarding the delayed baggage, were told that same would be delivered to our hotel the next morning and would be sent by the early morning flight.\n\nAt no stage did we receive any compensation, apart from being put to inconvenience.\n\n\n\nWe were travelling in Kenya in different places and started back on 29 Jan 2020 by KQ 204 and reached Mumbai on 30 Jan 2020. The staff at the airport in Nairobi had no answers for the delayed baggage compensation.\n\n\n\nOn flight experience:-\n\n\n\nMy wife was given seat no 15B on the flight KQ 205 to Nairobi. The seat had no button and could not recline. She called the Air Hostess to tell her that it was uncomfortable, due to her back needed a reclining seat and in case another seat could be given, she came back to say that the flight was full and she would not be in a position to help. She requested for the Flight supervisor, who came, he should be really commended for his non friendly and unprofessional attitude. An experienced and mature man, who had answers to everything, how things could not be done. He was kind enough to give lectures on advantages of not using a reclining seat, a straight seat was good for the back. We had four super specialist Doctors travelling with us, since we were on Kenya Airways flight had to take his advise.She even requested him stating that we have 25 persons travelling on board booked by our company and were ready to pay for the seat in Business Class, since there were seats vacant in the Business Class. He had a prompt reply to say that there was no provision to help her, she could get down in Nairobi and write a mail to Kenya Airways , they would revert and help her out. So much for inflight service and conduct of flight supervisor.\n\n\n\nIt did not end there. Before boarding the return flight KQ 204 on 29 Jan 2019,told the customer relations at the Airport to check that the seat should be reclining or put a remark that the seat should be fine,since the seat number was the same as 15B. Usual answer to say that they had no system of doing that. This time the seat had the button, but could not be reclined. This apart there was a very inhuman experience, my wife suddenly fell sick and collapsed on the seat. I jumped out of my seat to take help of the Doctor friends sitting two seats away. I told the Air Hostess that the Doctor is going to attend to her she is not well. She was very curt to tell me that I was coming on her way for them to serve others, we had also not taken our meals. Imagine the plight of a sick passenger and the attitude of the crew, if we did not have Doctor friends travelling wth us. Doctors reacted fast and gave her medicine and she slowly started reviving. Meanwhile I called the flight supervisor , Mr Raymond, who at least understood and got the box of medicines and the Doctor was comfortable and said that necessary injections could be given if required, since these were available on board. The Air Hostess did come back and apologise, obviously from the inputs she must have received. Only thing I told her was that even today, I go out of the way to help any accident victim, even on the road. He should do the same on the flight,\n\n\n\nI had to personally bear the brunt from everyone, since my company decided to take 25 persons on a tour of Kenya(4 in Business Class and 21 in Economy)and I decided to travel with them, something that I do not do. In this case all were friends and known to me.\n\n\n\nI have personally flown enough and have been in the travel business for over 30 years, regrettably it was a nightmare to have taken these flights.\n\n\n\nWhen I meet people anywhere I always tell people that have never had a bad experience and people have always been wonderful. I would not call this a bad experience, anywhere in the world or any airline, at least people are humane. It was totally amiss here.\n\nKenya is a wondeful country but would advise no one to fly Kenya Airways.\n\nAs advised by Kenya Airways office lodged an online complaint on 05/02/20, with a resolution date of 08/02/20 it 14/02/20 and still waiting to hear from them.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/29/91/3f/chandras3.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChandraS3","crvsd":"ChandraS3 wrote a review Feb 2020","ui_header_link":"ChandraS3","default":"New Delhi, India","phmbo":"247 contributions","phmbo1":"61 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r744986690-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Worst on board and off board experience on any airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Almost on time; first flight fell 25 Minutes late. I had made a low, but successful bid for 2nd leg to be upgraded as it also gave access to Kenya’s Lounge in Nairobi which is good and spacious. Ticket cheap, bought from an online travel company. Kenya Airways have reduced luggage allowance for regional flights, with Silver level in their Flying Blue FFP I eventually managed to get a 2nd, huge suitcase, added to be check-in (first one included in ticket). Check-in, transfers, and communication went fine. Onboard, great service, lots of drinks as there seem to be a Happy Hour going on at afternoon/evening flights. Whenever passengers ordered juice, beer or wine they were instantly handed double up without discussion. I love that attitude. It gives a feeling of luxury. I have experienced this before with KQ (on their Dubai route). Food was good, two options with the possibility to add up more as long stock lasted. FAs were fine. Call bells answered. Duty free sales onboard worked well. The Dreamliner is great but space provided in economy is humiliatingly small. I was lucky to have 3 seats to myself to survive lack of leg and breathing space. Pride lounge in Nairobi is a breeze and I slept well till next morning to catch last leg as being upgraded. Last leg morning flight NBO-KGL was uneventful. Of 9 business class seats (1 x 2 configuration). No complaints apart from a joke of “breakfast” consisting of a tired, reheated croissant. No cheese, only jam to supply.

Check-in and luggage handling went smoothly, but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my BPs issued on spot. Booking handling online works well. Their AF-KLM lounge offered in Bangkok is poor (like Thai Airways lounges) but their Pride lounge in Nairobi is good and spacious. Hardware on Kenya Airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues. The FAs are also good, plenty, observant. They are mainly Kenyans which does not help Chinese nor Thai passengers much. The very weak point of KQ is the food. Business class does not provide food any better than their Economy class and is plain, without vision, looking shabby. Competing airlines like Ethiopian, Turkish, South African, and Egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class. Steel cutlery and table preparation nice. But that’s it. Dinner from BKK was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs. Breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice. Very poor offerings. No meat, no cocktails, no cheeses, no icecream, no smoothies, chocolates, no fruits (watermelon does not count). Extremely poor catering, a disgrace for the airline. Beverages are shamefully very sparse, only 2 juices (apple or orange) are offered. Wines are only passable. Beers are cheap, waterish industrial stuff: 2 brands, Tusker and Heineken – not providing any alternatives to each other. No souvenir, no pyjamas, no luxury feelings at all. No lobster, no seafood, no caviar, no mutton, goat, pork, no beef, no chicken (maybe inside the breakfast sausage).  FA staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler. 1st flight on time, 2nd departed 1 hour late. Miles given quickly to Flying Blue. I will go again when the price is right. Lower expectation to food to zero and eat well at home or in lounge. Then it can be fairly good value for money when prices are promoted.","Image":"","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp","crvsd":"Anders P P wrote a review Feb 2020","ui_header_link":"Anders P P","default":"","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r743532229-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Food is a joke!","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The flight was delay two hours and finally canceled. It could happen. The passengers were transferred to a flight to Johannesburg and we were told that in Johannesburg Kenya representative will give us boardings for flight to Maputo with South African Airlines.  We asked about luggages and were confirmed that they will be transferred. All that happened 3 hours before the flight, quite a lot of time. In Johannesburg, nobody was expecting us and South Africa flight was fully booked and Kenya representative was helpless. It takes long time and many talks to get us on board and luggages were lost. We get ours 3 days later!

Most of airlines for long haul flights they provide a bunch of extras like slippers, toothbrash, a menu to choose meal etc. Kenya airways hasn't reach that level of service. Even the staff members, they were OK, but far away from a 5-star customer service. Nairobi airport (JKIA) is not the most pleasant place to have a long layover.

We decided to splurge and go business class on Kenya Airways for this once in a lifetime trip. They had a sale going on, so that definitely helped!  They are the only airline that has direct flights between JFK and Nairobi. The flights were both on time, the service was very nice, and the seats were very comfortable.  I actually slept on the way back for 8 hours straight, which I never do on a plane!  The food was fine- nothing amazing- but I don’t really expect it to be. I did have a vegetarian dinner on the way back that was quite good. They have only been offering this direct flight for a few years now and they fly the 787-8 Dreamliner, which is a nice aircraft. It seems a little quieter than other jets and the inflight movie selection was extensive. It was so great not having to transfer. The flight going is almost 13 hours and coming back was longer, so not having to deal with a layover was the best!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/07/ed/41/s5387gvsarahb.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5387GVsarahb","crvsd":"S5387GVsarahb wrote a review Jan 2020","ui_header_link":"S5387GVsarahb","default":"New York City, New York","phmbo":"26 contributions","phmbo1":"8 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r740396448-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Very pleasant flights both ways!","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Their help desk in NY is completely deserted for most of the day. I even inquired from a Delta rep and he told me that every single day, they get about 40 KQ travelers who have been displaced n screwed up by their airlines , so delta airlines ends  up being forced to fixed KQ's mess , including lost luggages,  every single day. Smh.On a 15hr flight, we were only served food once. Not only was the food so little , but it was also crappy n tasted like raw duck.! When you ask for tea, coffee or even juice , the flight attendants will take like 30min to serve you, not forgetting their nasty attitude. Plus they serve you coffee in baby cups, meant for 3 yr old toddlers.Arriving in NewYork, more than half of the passengers either had some or all their suitcases missing. Upon inquiry, we were told that most of the suitcases hadn't even left Nairobi.🤯! So I lost my gadgets , cologne , phone , and god knows what !

With an 8 hour lay over in Nairobi. Service on the plane was very much “couldn’t care less” I asked for red wine with my meal,they had 2 small bottles on board for everyone to share, no white wine at all, not one of the cabin crew could care less about delivering any sort of service. The entertainment system and content are so poor there is literally nothing worth turning it on for. When we came to board the flight from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro we were informed that the plane had been changed, as a result we had been downgraded to economy, and handed our new boarding passes. It is only an hours flight, not the end of the world, after much arguing they eventually gave us forms to claim back the difference in cost at least ( that fight is still to come).Arrived on time at Kilimanjaro, despite the 8 hour layover only one of our bags had made the journey with us!!!!! They could not care less, it was put onto a later flight, we were travelling four hours away, and we had to make arrangements to collect the bag ourselves, they totally washed their hands of any responsibility.\n\nThis experience could have ruined a wonderful 2 week holiday if we had let it.

I don't want to complain about the child that screamed and wasn't quiet for 5 minutes, because it's not the cabin crew's fault. After we were served our food, they almost took an hour to get our trays. I only saw the attendants twice. The bathroom door could not lock properly, it was just an awful experience.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zetlynn4","crvsd":"Zee wrote a review Jan 2020","ui_header_link":"Zee","default":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r737061438-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Worst flight ever","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They tag themselves as they ‘The pride of Africa’ and should immediately remove that as they are nothing but a disgrace to this lovely continent. We had 4 flights with them in a span on 15 days and out of which 3 were delayed for more than 10 hours each. First time, the machine failed and people had to wait overnight at the airport, second time they had shortage of crew and then their systems failed again and gave us hand written boarding passes?!  The airline had no sense of apology for the same. The staff is probably the most arrogant people I have met in my life as they are the least interested in providing service and do not care about keeping the passengers satisfied. They made excuses to even serve water that ‘they had too many passengers left to serve’. Travelling with Kenya airways was the biggest mistake of this wonderful trip I took to South Africa and I ended up spending more than 700 dollars per person to get hotel stays, etc due to their delays for which I did not even get a penny back.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahikaac","crvsd":"Mahika wrote a review Jan 2020","ui_header_link":"Mahika","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Mumbai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r737055079-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Never travel by this airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Come the next afternoon, we hadn't heard anything so we called KQ. A guy picked up the phone and told us he'd call back, he did not. We called again an hour later only to be told the bag had arrived and WE must come collect it. After going back and forth on the phone arguing that it is their job to deliver the luggage to us we just decided to hire a cab to go collect it and bring it to us. Conclusion, we ended up paying more money for an inconvenience caused  to us by KQ! Absolutely ridiculous, KQ, shameful. Good service would have ensured the passengers with lost luggage are compensated with convenience if not actually money! If I could rate negative I would. It's a shame there isn't more competition with domestic flights, but that should instead increase KQ's social responsibility not diminish it.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinagI2877YC","crvsd":"Martina G wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"Martina G","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Malindi","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r735281500-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Absolutely horrendous","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We booked our tickets online directly from Kenya Airways on the 2nd of November and on the 8th of November the money was deducted from my credit card. We saw that one of the flights directly after booking was cancelled and we phoned the airlines. They said we shouldn't worry and that we will receive an e-ticket after the cancelled flight has been fixed but till then our booking reference number will be fine. On the 15th we were suppose to fly at 23:00. At check-in the woman told as there's a problem and we have to go to ticket sales. At ticket sales they confirmed our booking and payment but noticed our tickets were never issued. We weren't alone 5 other had similar problems but since they booked through travel agents there's could be sorted out within the very last minute. My boyfriend and I missed the flight. Kenya's excuse were they never recieved confirmation of our payment. The next day at 7am we started phoning them. When they finally answered they did this thing where after they told us to hold they would end the line. By the fourth call my boyfriend warned them if they are going go to end the line again he will lose it. The woman confirmed that we could fly at 14:30. We phoned three more times to follow up. After 10am we were back at the airport at ticket sales. Same problem no answer, no ticket and no help from Kenya Airways. At 12:30 we got the news that we only have two options they refund our ticket (but also not immediately) and we have to pay for more expensive tickets and no compensation or we should take a refund. After spending R300 on Uber, R400 on airtime to phone to Kenya and all the other small travel expenses we took the refund and now missed our holiday and our paid accommodation. Please please please don't fly with Kenya Airways. It's not uncommon for bad things to happen but they happen frequently according to other reviews with Kenya Airways rather than it going well.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lienels","crvsd":"Lien wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"Lien","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r733214071-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Stay Away","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They do not, however, have the slightest clue with regard to flight scheduling or keeping scheduled flights on time. This is where things go badly wrong, and the resultant mayhem is why you should avoid this airline at all cost.\n\nWe recently flew with Kenya Airways from Cape Town to Zanzibar. Our departure was scheduled for 11pm but, after an initial cancellation and later reinstatement of the flight, we eventually left for Zanzibar at 3.30am. We obviously missed our connecting (also Kenya Airways) flight to Zanzibar and had to endure a full day in Nairobi at a second rate hotel - which took an hour to get to in a clapped out bus. Back at the Nairobi airport that evening, our booking had disappeared from their check-in system. It took us three trips to their own ticket office in the same building before we were finally issued with boarding passes. The service was shockingly poor and incompetent.\n\nWhen we finally got to Zanzibar late that night, after a 12 hour delay, they had managed to lose our luggage. Three days later, and after having had to spend $400 to buy some clothes and toiletries, we received our luggage. But the clincher is that the bags stood at Zanzibar airport for a day before they finally got in touch. We had to pay for another transfer to have it collected - turns out they don't deliver your luggage when they incompetently lose it.\n\nWe have yet to receive an apology from anyone. I don't expect any.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriaan23","crvsd":"adriaan23 wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"adriaan23","default":"Paarl, South Africa","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r732988951-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The embarrassment of Africa.","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I arrived in Nairobi my luggage was badly damaged.  Delta informed me Kenya Airwas was responsible for repairs, replacement or compensation.  I took the bag to Kenya Airways Ya Ya Centre office and was promised it would be repair or resolved within 10 days.  Four weeks later, after numerous visits to the YaYa office to check on their progress, I was offered $30US minus 10% for a bag that was 17 days old.  I then asked for return of the bag and was informed the bag had never left the YaYa center.  I did not receive the bag until the day I was scheduled to leave.  The bag was badly damaged and I had to pay for tape and glue to get it to the airport and then wrapping.  Adding insult to injury I was unable to us DHL because we did not know what would have to go in the DHL package until we received the bag and then it was too late.  I then had to pay an additional overweight fee.  But the problem does not end there, once I returned home, the damaged bag did not arrive.  I had flown Delta from Paris to my home city.  At first I was told by Delta the bag had only been checked to JFK.  I had to explain even though I had flown out of JFK, it was not my final return destination.  I received my bag the next day with further damage and items broken inside.  Both Delta and Kenya Airways provided no assistance during my many visits to inquire about the bag.  Delta also repeatedly told me it was not their responsibility as Kenya Airways was the last to handle the bag.  This ticket was booked through Delta's website and I am a frequent flyer member.  However, I will not be flying them again unless absolutely necessary.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/5b/avatar033.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justineisu","crvsd":"Justineisu wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"Justineisu","default":"Metro Atlanta","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"23 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r731813884-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Delta and Kenya Airways - Damaged Bag and They Did Nothing About It","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

As indicated by Kenya airways representatives at the airport, the flight from Bangui was cancelled due to technical reason.\n\nThe representatives at the airport were uninformed and unable to provide basic information concerning follow-on flights and any compensation due to inconveniences caused by the cancellation (for instance hotel room and any follow-on reservation already reserved in Nairobi and at the final destination). We were told to comeback at the airport the following day at 1500 to all get on the next flight. We were also told that if any earlier flight would be available, that we would be contacted by phone.\n\nThat evening I contacted by phone Kenya Airways and was told that I was in fact already scheduled to leave the next day early in the morning and not at 1500 (as confirmed by their representative). The KQ representative never called me to inform me that I should present myself earlier. Had I not dealt with this by myself, I would have missed my re-routing flight.\n\nWith the flight cancellation:\n- I arrived to my final destination over 20 hours late.\n-I had to wait 12 hours in Douala for my connecting flight (where Kenya airways did not even provide me with a 10$ voucher or something to recognize the long layover) - I did not benefit from any of the service provided by Kenya airways representatives in Bangui, as again, they provided me initially with inaccurate information and then were totally absent in following-up with an update.\n\nWhen I did a compensation claim for this travel, Kenya airways inform me that they could only issue me a 100$ voucher that can only be used to travel with them again, or pay for their lounge or excess luggage (which is clearly what I will avoid doing in the future). This voucher is not going to even cover the basic cost of my delay (loss hotel reservation, money spent at the airport for the 12 hours layover etc).\n\nHighly disappointed in the customer service of this company. If you fly with them make sure you have great insurance (they themselves asked me to contact my individual travel insurer for recompense as they would not do anything). Avoid altogether.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJP555","crvsd":"JJP555 wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"JJP555","default":"","phmbo":"4 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Bangui - Paris","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r730928066-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Avoid at all cost.

First started with them after I couldn't deal anymore with Ethiopian Airlines' normal 2 am arrival time in Nairobi (getting people to come and pick you up in the pre-Uber days always involved more effort than I could deploy). I started with them with much trepidation initially, but 4 years down the line, I must say that they have done very well, so far.\n\nFlight attendants are of variable quality, some make it seem as if they would rather be elsewhere; some are friendly and professional. Pilots are generally good - I travel around in Europe fairly frequently and would say KQ pilots measure up to what I've experienced there. One major gripe is the old -looking planes and poor in-flight entertainment options - only flown an newish KQ plane once when they put a Dreamliner on the Lagos-Nairobi route. Food is of variable quality per flight, but again as far as I am concerned all airline food is generally lousy. Taking another KQ flight in February - I understand the Kenyan government is taking the airline over again next year - so will watch the airline a while after February to see how its fortunes develop.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LegalTranslating","crvsd":"Legal Translator wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"Legal Translator","default":"","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Lagos - Antananarivo","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r730376245-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Reasonably good experience with KQ so far","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have to say that the business lounges are superb, beautifully laid out and a HUGE variety of food and drink on offer to suit all tastes. The leg from Nairobi to Paris was overnight so the seats almost fully reclined to enable a pleasant sleep. Meals on board were very good too. If there is one minor criticism it is that the entertainment was rather limited compared to other international airlines, but when you are asleep for much of the journey it doesn't really impact on the experience. It was rather a culture shock to arrive in Paris and find that the business lounge (Air France) was awful and have written to them separately.

We said we did want it, it was an 8 hour flight so entertainment was needed! Once the screen was up we found ourselves to be completely trapped in our seats. There was no way to get out without either taking down the entire cot or asking the lady next to us to move so we could clamber over the seats (which we didnt like to do as she was travelling alone and the situation was not at all her fault). To summarise, we had the choice of being bored for the flight but being able to get to the toilet, or to watch films and be stuck in our seats.\nThe health implications of not being able to freely move are obvious, as is the safety concern should there be an emergency evacuation with no time to remove the cot etc! This situation would have been annoying at the standard price but having paid significantly more, we were no better off than in a standard seat.\n\nWe also found the entertainment system control to be damaged in one of our seats.\n\nOnce home we tried to contact KA through the recommended channels regarding the matter. We followed this up with a further email asking for someone to get back to us. To date, 7 weeks since we flew, no response has been recieved.\n\nOn a plus note, staff on board were polite and the food was edible.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/20/5a/ba/evolvetraveller.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvolveTraveller","crvsd":"Sarah wrote a review Nov 2019","ui_header_link":"Sarah","default":"","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - London","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r724745554-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Poor, unsafe","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I fly often, on long hauls I usually fly Singapore Airlines un so I am quite demanding. Kenya Airways was a good surprise!\nAIRCRAFT from Geneva was good but not remarkable. From Nairobi to Zanzibar, Embraer 190 was brand new and despite it is a small aircraft, each seat had its own screen.\nFOOD was good, on every flight was proposed a choice of 3 meals one of which vegetarian (so a choice of 3 hot meals on the Geneva Nairobi and back, and on the 1h10min flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar there was a choice of 3 sorts of sandwiches). My daughter had a CHILD'S MEAL that she really enjoyed, nothing spicy like we got on other airlines (Emirates) but chicken potatoes and vegetables on first flight and lasagne on another flight (one child's meal picture is in attachment). She even received a special sandwich on short flights to and from Zanzibar.\nWINE was from South Africa, pretty good.\nAll flights were ON TIME or landed earlier than scheduled.\nLovely STAFF, generous, they were regularly crossing the aircraft offering drinks and asking is anything was needed.\nQUALITY for PRICE is surely excellent!\nNEGATIVE points:\n1. Nairobi airport is quite small and if you have a long stopover there is no much to do.\n2.The sound of my entertainment program did not work on the flight back.\n3.

They have a modern fleet of planes including the lovely 787 Dreamliner and the staff are friendly and efficient.  The booking and check in process is relatively pain free and when I changed my flight back to the UK, although I had to pay a charge to do so, the information on how to do so was clear and concise and efficient.

I made my checking early and then went to drop off language ( all people mixed and no difference if you checked early or at desk) . The annonce you 20 min delay . Then I said it’s fine . Did the formalities. And processed to the lounge and cleared some email.\nTime to embark. I went normally to my place and sat waiting . The temperature was high like in sauna and the AC not functioning. We are waiting 1h30 inside the aircraft . We hear that engine we failing and they are fixing it . Then electric power suddenly dropped off , they restarted it again and then the engineer sitting behind me was called . What happen : captain board failed . When trying to fix this situation, they discovered by chance fuel leakage!!!\n\nThey closed the curtain as if it is going to stop me hearing them . Then they announced after complete 2 hours in the plain that we need to disembark because the above reason and they are going to change the aircraft.\nWhen disembarking every one saw the fuel leaking as if you opened tap wanted in kitchen . Fireman truck was in place too . I asked one of the employees. At what time we will embark in the new craft . He says 11h30 Kenya time . Ok . I took my belongings and went back to lounge to work . And watching the aircraft been repaired fireman covering the fuel on tarmac with foam and waiting for the next flight . Ok 11 30 they announced it will be at 2 pm ok stress , and fatigue are going night . Any other option flightier Dakar : NO . Then I see that we will embark in the same gate where the first flight is still standing.\nKenya airways didn’t keep its word on changing the aircraft but stick to the same . I asked the attendees are we embarking to the same flight he said yes , the captain talk to everyone and reassured everyone that the aircraft has been fixed . IS THAT ENOUGH GUARANTEE FOR YOU !!\n\nLot of people refused to embark. But the company didn’t give choice as saying next flight in in 3 days . So all these people are rubbish for you you don’t care on their security .\nFinally to take of and it was past 3pm .\nWhen we entered the turbulence zone . That was the extreme mental torture. As you really don’t know if it is the plane or turbulence. People were on there nerve .\n\nSince Friday every time I close my eyes I only see and here that turbulence time . A real trauma .\n\nAddition to this the flight in business class even are crappy not confortable and not to standard to the price paid .\nThe company should be ashamed saying that they are the pride of AFRICA","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kawtar282","crvsd":"kawtar a wrote a review Nov 2019","ui_header_link":"kawtar a","default":"Dakar, Senegal","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Dakar","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r724017417-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Terrible experience: mental torture and delays","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Arriving at the airport, we were refused boarding because my husband did not have a visa to Mauritius. We explained that we don't need a visa as we have been to the country a couple of times before, but they were brutal, harsh,the kids were crying as we were going as a family. We had booked 3 months before and if we knew how Kenya Airways is, we would have applied for that visa as we had enough time for it. They did not phone Mauritian Consular but instead they phone Nairobi who said no boarding. It was a sad flight for a family going on holiday. Arriving in Mauritius I explained the situation to the customs officer who told me that they should not have done that ! I had to go to the Immigration Department which gave me an official letter and send it to them saying that he can come to Mauritius without a visa, the mauritian people were very nice and professional. He came after a couple of days without paying any extras that they asked us to pay but we refused as it was their fault. The experience was distressing, I contacted the Kenya Airways without any response...STAY AWAY PEOPLE, this airline as well as the country needs staff training. They are cheap but they will cost you more after. Even though you don't need a visa, make sure that you phone them before booking with them as they will take it upon themselves to decide if you need a visa or not. My husband went somewhere else in Africa with Kenya Airways where he did not need a visa, but because of this experience, he applied for one anyway!  If you can pay a little bit more and avoid Kenya Airways, do it, otherwise make sure that you get a visa, phone the Kenya Airways and not the country you are traveliing to. REALLY REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE...without mentioning the state of the plane from Kenya to Mauritius which was as dispressing as the experience. We had to sit sometimes in the dark because the light will switch off even the flight, and there was no TV, toilet disgusting...and until now, no response, not even an apology from Kenya Airways, however tons from OPODO where we book the ticket from and who told me to put this review.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/webnessie","crvsd":"Nessie wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"Nessie","default":"Folkestone, United Kingdom","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Mahebourg","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r720905740-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Worst airline that I have been so far","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I am a frequent flyer with budget airlines so my expectations are low. During my 6 weeks holiday to Tanzania and Madagascar I had 5 flights with Kenya Airways. 3 flights were heavily delayed without explanation, 1 flight was cancelled due to overbooking, we had to de-board one plane due to a system malfunction on preparing for take off and board another, only for the replacement to also require work from the engineering team. They lost our luggage for 5 days during our transfer from Tanzania to Madagascar. The general service is poor, with most of the staff being uninterested and incompetent. The 'food' was disgusting.

For that, Thank you Kenya Air!  The flight and ground crews were great, along with the airport lounges.  though the lounges aren't great for vegans, but we figured such before hand and brought snacks.  Now, if i were to comment on the insignificant, petty things,  it would be that business class service was a 3 out of 5 as they are not as proactively attentive as with, virgin air for example.  but they are nice and you can of course ask them for anything.  in-flight entertainment is not great, bring your own.

Connecting to Kenya airways from Mauritius to Nairobi. On one ticket.\nThere was only about an hour and\nA half transit. Both Kenya airways and air Mauritius confirmed this was long enough to transfer myself and my luggage which had been booked straight through from Perth.\nAt the transit desk I requested they check to see if my luggage had been transferred. I was told Kenya airways said they had my luggage, my two cases had already been transferred.\nOn arriving in Nairobi my cases were nowhere to be seen.\nKenya airways help desk advised me they had received an email from Kenya Airways Mauritius sayings my luggage had not made the transfer? I had been assured in Mauritius it was already loaded.\nThe lady at the Kenya airways desk in Nairobi - it’s now nearly midnight and passengers were exhausted. - advised my cases would be delivered the following morning.\nThey didn’t bother calling me but the apartments I was staying at to advise them my cases had been left behind again.\nI was lied to twice by Kenya Airways.\nI had to go out and buy clothes and toiletries which I shouldn’t have had to purchase if my cases had arrived on time.\nI was advised by Kenya airways they would not compensate me for these goods.\nOnly if your cases go missing for 21 days will they consider compensation!\nThis is not the first time they have left my luggage behind. I’ve had my bags broken into and items taken. My relatives have also had the same experience. They refused to compensate for items not arriving. In fact their office in South Africa is dreadful - extremely rude employees.\nWhen the manager at the serviced apartments I’m staying at heard my luggage did not arrive he immediately said you must have flown Kenya airways. Apparently many of their guests have had similar experiences.\nI wanted to cancel my next flight as it’s on Kenya Airways. They won’t give a full refund if any!\nMy advice to anyone flying if you value your luggage give Kenya Airways a miss until they get a grip of their poor management, lying staff light fingered staff\nAlso I’ll add the flight from Mauritius business class is really bad. The seats are recliners not flat bed and it’s a long flight, very uncomfortable. Only two choices of food fish or mutton!\nThe staff on the flight were kind and thoughtful which is negated by the poor ground staff.\nI had requested wheelchair assistance which they confirmed - I had to wait three quarters of an hour on board while they looked for a wheelchair.\nThey need to update the aircraft on that stretch of the flight.

It depends on the assessment criteria of course but after a recent experience in Sierra Leone flying to Accra in Ghana I'd say it well deserves the title.\nFirst let me confirm that it was equipment failure [the left engine] that stopped the flight and with that I have no problem at all - I'd rather be alive and late than dead in the air on time. So for safety they get a big tick; though conversations among other stranded passengers might suggest that these problems occur so frequently for KQ as to question the thoroughness of Kenya Airways maintenance schedules.\nIt is not the ordinary on time scheduled performance by which an airline should be judged but rather how they handle a problem or crisis. I could provide chapter and verse, if this review space allowed for such specifics, as to how badly they performed - no customer care, almost non existent communication, no systematic response, no evidence of organization and process - it was chaos from the outset. Such might, at a very long stretch be excusable in the crisis of the initial moment, but the chaos persisted all through the next day when they'd had overnight and 24 hours to get things sorted [and i don't mean in repairing the plane - i mean in taking care of their customers].\nConstantly they misled, prevaricated, offered contradictory advice and information, made promises they couldn't possibly have managed, withheld information, undertook to contact everyone the next day by a particular time and no contact at that time or ever was received, botched arrangements for overnight accommodation and transport to and from ..... the list of systemic failures is endless.\nEverything that happened was avoidable - we suffered the consequences of 'just in time thinking' - it is obvious that Kenya Airways have no plans or systems in place for such a predictable emergency, or if they do then they don't know how to implement them. We were assured from the outset that they were in touch with head office in Nairobi so one can only assume that the incompetence displayed reaches to the very top of the organization.\nBy now the reader may be thinking 'well you get what you pay for'. And pay I certainly did - this was a premier world ticket [their business class] and it cost for the 2 hour flight about 4 times what a similar length flight on any one of 6 major airlines in Europe would cost. [Yes the legroom and food and cleanliness on Board were fine but they pale into insignificance besides the demonstrated witless response to a problem]\nMost alarmingly chaos prevailed even when we finally got on a flight 28 hours later - I heard passengers being told by the cabin crew and Pursar as they came on board to just sit anywhere as the boarding passes for the flight didn't match. I am not sure what the passenger manifest signed off by KQ for that flight represented but it would seem not to have borne much connection to the human contents of the flight.\nYou might have perhaps expected this review to end by advising that there was some follow up from the company, some check that things had got sorted, perhaps an apology, because their PR spiel says that we are valued customers and they want us to fly with them again - and they do know our names and our contact details after all. Not a word, not a call, not a text message, not an email, not a general tweet - just silence!\nKenya Airways call themselves the \"Pride of Africa\" - if I was an African Nation I would be insisting they stop bringing the name of Africa into disrepute.\nSo my advice - Avoid if you can and if you can't expect the worst and you won't be disappointed.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmQ3826RS","crvsd":"Paul M wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"Paul M","default":"Adelaide Hills, Australia","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Freetown - Accra","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r719395476-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Avoid if you can!","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff at Kenya Airways desk initially insisted that we would have to pay the full fare for a new flight at 5.00pm. When we refused to do so they said there were Business Class seats available on the 1.30pm flight which we could have if we paid the difference between Economy and Business. With reluctance we asked what the difference in price would be. The Kenya Airways staff member said she had checked the price difference twice on screen and it would be $US210 per person. We agreed to pay the difference on the basis that we would dispute the cost later with Kenya Airways. In order to create a paper trail we insisted on paying by credit card. We were told that if we paid cash we could do it at this desk. If we insisted on paying by card we would have to go back through Security, buy another visa (as we had technically left the country) and pay at the Kenya Airways desk on the concourse. When my partner eventually got to the Kenya Airways concourse desk the staff again insisted he pay in cash. When he refused they suggested they would void the reserved Business Class seats. He continued to insist on paying by card. At this point the price for the upgrade mysteriously dropped from $US210 to $US184 per person. Our conclusion was that the relevant Kenya Airways staff had intended to take the additional $US52 as a “commission “. By the way, my partner did not need to buy a new visa to get back through Security. And we discovered on the flight that our upgrade to Business Class entitled us to the grand total of a glass of water and a wet towel!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fredbloggs456","crvsd":"Bren White wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"Bren White","default":"","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r718710166-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Be careful with Kenya Airways staff in Nairobi","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

If I was to make a suggestion, I would request that KQ would broaden their entertainment package or better still have WiFi available.\nAll in all, I would recommend this flight for people who do not mind the long hours in the air and are looking for an affordable flight to Nairobi, Kenya and New York.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lctaiti23","crvsd":"lctaiti23 wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"lctaiti23","default":"Newark, Delaware","phmbo":"7 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Mombasa","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r718073194-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"First timer...","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The first 2 legs were via air France then the final leg to Nairobi was Kenya airways. The flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was on time thankfully but the plane, considering it's not that old, was tired and dated. The service wasn't great. You won't receive the offer of a drink unless it's meal time and no snacks are provided. The food wasn't great, beef or chicken curry with rice for the hot meal and a stale croissant and piece of cake for breakfast. If you ask for water you'll only be given a cup not a bottle. The onboard entertainment is ok with some newer films but not many. The plane seats are pretty hard, not great for long haul.\nMy return flight from Nairobi to Paris was due to leave at 11:40pm (most international flights seem to leave late at night). This meant I had 11 hours to kill in Nairobi as my flight from Malindi landed around 1pm. I had already checked in so wanted to drop my bags. The desk was reluctant at first to allow this. They said if I dropped my bags I wouldn't be allowed to leave the airport but also it wouldn't be safe to take my luggage around Nairobi. I asked to speak to someone else as it seemed silly that bag drop was open but it meant I was then stuck in the airport. Eventually they agreed I could drop my bags and exit as it was such a long wait. (If anyone else has a long layover I recommend the giraffe centre and carnivore restaurant. We hired a driver called Daniel for a reasonable price to take us round and wait for us and also store bags of our 2 friends who flew with BA and couldn't drop their bags.)\nWe returned to the airport around 9pm and went straight to our gate. We were due to board at 11:05pm, by 11:30pm there still was no plane at our gate. No communication from the staff until another passenger asked. We were told the plane 'was up there somewhere circling'. Eventually an official announcement was made that the flight was delayed an hour. The gate was very hot and stuffy so they allowed passengers to leave if they wished. Our new flight time of 12:40 came and went, again we were only told of the delay way after the time passed. I left to get coffee and as I was queuing they began to board at 1am. I had to run back to the gate. I paid to upgrade to extra leg room on the return leg which made the uncomfortable seating a little more bearable. The lights were dimmed so people began to sleep only to be woken by the attendants bringing round hot meals around 2:30am. Again, no drinks offered outside of 'meal time'. Breakfast was slightly better than the outbound flight, eggs, potato and spinach with a yoghurt and crossiant. However they leave you with your empty trays for far too long, making you very uncomfy and restricted.\nThe long delay to our flight meant our 2hr 30 layover in Paris was reduced to 15 mins. Upon landing I mentioned to the crew I needed to disembark quickly and could any ground staff help getting us to our connection. This was just met with a shrug.\nOverall I would avoid flying with Kenya airways again. They aren't much cheaper in comparison with much better airlines and improvement is required.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danstar858","crvsd":"danstar858 wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"danstar858","default":"Manchester, United Kingdom","phmbo":"29 contributions","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r717974815-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Room for improvement","tehyy":"","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

KQ set the minimum bid at around $1,150pp, we bid the minimum amount, and we “won.”\n\n$2,400 later, we wouldn’t do it again (we actually flew Coach on the way back). Yes, business class is nicer and more comfortable than coach, but it’s not worth that kind of money, especially in the highly likely event that the coach cabin isn’t full.\n\nThis isn’t the business/first class treatment you see in the movies and magazines. Chairs are bigger and more comfortable than coach and they basically lie flat, although they’re hardly as good as a bed and at 6 feet tall I had to lie at an angle to keep my feet from pressing against the wall.\n\nThe dining trays and monitors are on very cumbersome hinges. it takes some oomph just to get them properly opened and positioned. The biggest problem with the chairs is that they eat phones!! My wife’s phone slid into the cushions and a couple of attendants had to take a goodly part of the chair apart to retrieve. We felt very awkward about causing the difficulty, but then it happened to two other people during our flight!!\n\nFood was fine but again, pretty meh for business class. Movie options ranged from dates to obscure. Service was fine but English proficiency seemed a bit lacking.\n\nI would actually rate the coach class experience better because at least there you get what you pay for. It really wasn’t terrible for a 13hr flight. And I give high marks for KQ opening this direct route from New York to Nairobi. It’s by far the best way to get from the states to central Africa.\n\nBut yeah, I wish I hadn’t paid that $2,400 for business class. Not worth it. But if you’ve got the money or the points to waste, by all means enjoy!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmirak","crvsd":"Brad M wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"Brad M","default":"Wichita, Kansas","phmbo":"465 contributions","phmbo1":"12 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r717386894-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Average Quality, But Convenient Route","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were informed that the next flight would be at 11pm that evening and we would be taken to a hotel and brought back to board that plane. No explanation was provided as to why we were not allowed to board by any staff members and no apologies were given.\nThe 11pm flight was delayed due to \"technical issues\" all passengers were able to see engineers trying to do a patch work job on the plane from the boarding gate area above.\nAfter the plane was \"fixed\" we boarded the plane, after 12:15am. 30 - 45 mins into the flight, the captain announced that the plane was going back to Nairobi, because there was an issue with the plane, and it was unsafe to fly. Essentially the airline let the plane take off knowing it was unsafe, effectively endangering the lives of everyone on-board.\nOnce again, we were checked into a hotel overnight, were we were told that passengers had to share a room between two people. As a young woman traveling on my own, I refused to share a room with a stranger.\nThe next morning I was back at the airport for a 3rd time and I was able to successfully reach my destination of Harare well over 24hrs after my scheduled arrival time !

This was my second time using the airline and was happy that services have improved though there is still some work to be done. The flights were on time which was quite impressive. The flight attendants were friendly and the food served was OK. I was impressed by the pilots who flew close to Mt Kilimanjaro just to allow the passengers the great view!\n\nThe main problem with Kenyan airways is how bad they handle luggage. Both times i have used the airline, my luggage was delayed. The first time, I only managed to get my luggage after about 4 days. This time around, I checked my luggage from Johannesburg well on time but the luggage was not loaded and therefore didn't make it with the flight. I was however happy that the luggage arrived early the following morning- i was expecting the worst based on previous experience.\n\nKENYAN AIRWAYS MANAGEMENT: Please do something about your luggage handling.

Check in smooth online where I was notified by KQ 36 hours prior to kick-off. In airport things went well. Granted access to Rwandairs’ Dream Lounge as the usual Business Lounge is under renovation. On the first flight business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration. For solo travellers its important to select the single seats on the left (column A). Welcome champagne given provided the passengers request it, otherwise it is not offered. They had two food options (veg. or chicken) which both were ridiculous, loaded from Nairobi: 1 toothpick of chicken or vegs with a grinded potato cake, total some 50 grams served on a disgusting. Seats are classic Business class with limited reline. Can not justify the high price tag for business class on short flights. In Nairobi I used the wonderful Pride Lounge to catch up with Premier League. The longer leg NBO-DXB was much nicer and a true business class experience. I had two hot kinds of hot meals and they were both acceptable (fish and steak). Staff well rested and In a sparkling mood. IFE fine. Roomy lie flat beds. Food is deteriorating, really bad and poor compared to earlier years of glory. No quality beers and only 1 or 2 wines offered. And the 2 beer brands they offer are just industrialised mass products of low quality.

I had booked a hotel in Nairobi.   Kenya Airways inexplicably changed the flight schedule so KQ259 departs at 3:15 AM!!   I unfortunately learned this reflects their complete disregard for the human beings who are their passengers.I was able to cancel my hotel but had to kill 9 hours at the small Seychelles airport, and then right as we were ready to board, they announced the flight was cancelled.  According to some airport personnel, Kenya Airways frequently does this.  This meant I could not get to Livingstone, where I was booked that night at an expensive resort (prepaid and non-refundable).Kenya Airways issued vouchers but sent us to a horrible hotel that was very old and smelled badly.   The very nice service manager in Seychelles said he had contacted Nairobi and they'd be all prepared for me (there were other problems, like needing a visa and vouchers because of another overnight stay caused by their cancellation, and them having trouble honouring an exit row I had prepaid for).  However, NO ONE in Nairobi knew what was going on.  I was shuffled from person to person and desk to desk.  I wound up spending over 2 hours trying to leave the airport and finally left around 10 PM.  The bus drove over 30 minutes, past dozens of airport hotels, to another horrible property that feels really unsafe (there is LOTS of security!).   Obviously, Kenya Airways makes deals with these second rate properties so they don't have to send their passengers to decent properties.   Meantime, I got here at 10:10, and they are picking me up to return to the airport at 4 AM.All up, this means over 48 hours of no sleep because of Kenya Airways cancellation and subsequent disorganization and disregard.  Sleep deprivation makes everything difficult, and Kenya Aiways has single handedly compromised my long-planned holidayI see there are other travelers with similar, or much worse, experiences, so I don't think mine was an unusual experience.  Don't let this airline ruin your holiday - it will be well worth the money to pay extra to avoid Kenya Airways","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/40/97/8f/drbobqa.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrBobQA","crvsd":"DrBobQA wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"DrBobQA","default":"Queensland, Australia","phmbo":"43 contributions","phmbo1":"41 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Victoria - Livingstone","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r713451977-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Nightmare!!

We thought we were so lucky that there was a non-stop flight from NYC area to Nairobi, Kenya. We went ahead and booked on Kenya Airways. As we go closer to our departure date we were offered to bid on upgrading to Business Class Cabin, for a significant fee. We had just received a new credit card that had no interest for 18 months so we decided that we would splurge on ourselves and bid to upgrade and get the chance to be a little pampered and arrive rested in Kenya. Things were good when we were seated. The cabin crew was amazing! I place no fault on them for any of this. You see, as it turned out, both our entertainment systems were malfunctioning which made using them an inconvenience. On a 14hr flight it's a big deal to have distractions and not having the system functioning properly made the trip feel even longer. And we paid a LOT of money to get premium service. So I complained to Kenya Airways directly and let them know how disappointed I was. They could care less. No offers to make it right like maybe passes to the airport lounge for our return flight, or some discount on something in the future. They just don't care and don't feel they need to make it right. I feel ripped off and if we ever do get to visit that beautiful country again it certainly won't be on this airline.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/95/avatar021.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DGVNJ","crvsd":"DGVNJ wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"DGVNJ","default":"Elmwood Park, New Jersey","phmbo":"145 contributions","phmbo1":"169 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r712922976-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"NEVER upgrade to Business, you will get ripped off.","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At 6:30, someone finally came to the check in desk, but we had to still wait longer as the travel document checker was still not there.\nAt check in, the agent told us that the boarding time was 2 hours before departure due to additional security measures (after the main secuirty). Of course, the secondary security agents were also 45 minutes late and after we passed through this security checkpoint, we had to wait another hour or so to board to plane.\nYou could have guessed this already, but the flight also departed 30+ minutes late.\nAt arrival in New York, after they opened the cabin door, a cabin crew member commanded everyone to return to their seats and put their luggage away without explanation. We were to wait around again.\nThe only positive thing I can say about Kenya Airways is that they have non-stop flights between JFK and Nairobi, but I might choose another airline if Kenya Airways stays as disorganized and as poor in their customer service skills.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/ba/3f/ae/caption.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seeeyes","crvsd":"Dani wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"Dani","default":"Spring Lake, New Jersey","phmbo":"42 contributions","phmbo1":"10 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r710885855-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"An airline with poor customer service and organization","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

That means a lot of crew members at busy times and passengers have to wait.Boarding the 787 was strictly by seat row numbers which really made the boarding process a breeze and the fully laden aircraft was ready to leave ahead of schedule.  Following take-off, a breakfast snack was served: a choice of chicken or vegetarian (small) pastie and a small cake with hot/cold/alcoholic drinks (seated at the rear and receiving all food/drink services last, I was unsure whether passengers at the front had a third choice – usually KQ offer that).  A hot dinner (choice of chicken or vegetarian Bake) was served 3 hours before arrival and, again, not sure if a 3rd choice was initially available.  Just two drink rounds during the 8-hour flight although drinks could be collected from the rear galley throughout.  I’d describe KQs food as basic and bland although I took my own food on board as I know what this airline's offering can be like.With the exception of one uncommunicative and unhappy looking individual whose name badge announced ‘Sylvia’, the all-female Cabin Crew were cheerful and appeared to enjoy their work.  Little information came from the Flight Deck.An on-time arrival into Amsterdam on to a very convenient ‘E’ Gate next to the Terminal hub with a wide range of comfortable facilities and friendly staff.  AMS is one of the best transit airports in Europe.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/fa/3d/80/simbal09.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simbal09","crvsd":"Simbal09 wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"Simbal09","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"160 contributions","phmbo1":"109 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Amsterdam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r710832980-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Satisfactory","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I missed my connecting flight to Johannesburg. I should have been in Johannesburg by 16:30 on Sunday. The next suitable flight was only on Monday at 7:45 AM. I stayed at a hotel but when I got to the airport in Nairobi on Monday morning I was told the 7:45 flight was cancelled. I would have to wait till 13:15 to catch the next flight to Johannesburg.

It flies to several countries in Africa as well as a range of destinations further afield.  It is not a great flight experience which would be ok if the price wasn't so high.The positives around Kenya Airways are the quick check-in.  The dedicated terminal in Nairobi for instance is incredibly quick with hardly any queues mid-morning on a weekday.  It is really easy to get around the small terminal although there is not a huge amount to do there.The on-board experience is ok but not quite as friendly as anticipated.  After being encouraged to take up an emergency exit seat given the need fo the row to be populated there was not really any friendly communication afterwards once the staff had got what they wanted.  Seating is uncomfortable.  The lining of the seat does not make for a great experience for a 3+ hour flight.  The fabric is not tight against the seat structure so creates slight friction.  The design is ugly in any case.  Legroom was ok with enough space for a normal-sized person in either a typical row or emergency exit row.The in-flight experience is minimal.  Food is included and on request a pre-ordered dietary requirement meal was grudgingly provided.  It was not great.  The food was pretty ropey to be honest.  Entertainment selection is limited.  There are not many options.  The television options were largely extremely dull lowest common denominator American comedies while the film selection to its credit did include 1 or 2 classics along with a small range of contemporary Hollywood, Bollywood, and a couple of other options.All the limitations would be fine if this was a moderate cost flight but it is really quite expensive.  A return flight Kinshasa-Nairobi is not cheap in the slightest and so at the price the quality is not good enough.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/a0/62/7a/malarchy.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malarchy","crvsd":"Malarchy wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"Malarchy","default":"Vienna, Austria","phmbo":"844 contributions","phmbo1":"609 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kinshasa - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r709840306-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Expensive but moderate quality","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Once in Nairobi had to argue with desk agent to get connection booked. And then had another 8 hours layover. My Visit to business lounge, I was questioned as to my validity to use this facility even with business class ticket. Once in lounge this food was also cold and limited. Not the standard experienced from other airline lounges. Never saw an employee smile anywhere on Kenya and never felt appreciated or even remotely welcomed. Lounge had dirty toilets. Needless to say.

Informative commentaries by the First Officer in Kiswahili and English were supported by further announcements from the Cabin Purser albeit that the low volume from the Purser allowed few passengers to hear what was said.  Although service from the all-female African Cabin Crew, smartly attired in their smart crimson blouses and bright red trouser suits was satisfactory, they gave the distinct impression that they had to do the job rather wanted to do it!  At times, it was relatively lackadaisical although this may have partly reflected their culture rather than their motivation.  A basic, sufficient and tasty meal with Beef, Chicken and Vegetarian choices was served after take-off with hot/cold/alcoholic drinks although some seated at the rear of the aircraft were denied this full choice since service always commenced at the front and meals were slowly depleted as the crew moved rearwards.  Water rounds continued during the 7½ flight every 30 minutes and a small snack with hot/cold drinks was served an hour before landing.  Despite the 32” pitch and 18.5” wide seats, I was not entirely comfortable and room for manoeuvring was limited in the full cabin.  Kenyan Airways has the scrap line ‘The Pride of Africa’: this is erroneous for the airline service that I experienced certainly wasn’t although I had no complaints and would consider flying with the company again if the price matched other airlines.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/fa/3d/80/simbal09.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simbal09","crvsd":"Simbal09 wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"Simbal09","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"160 contributions","phmbo1":"109 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r709035649-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"As Good As Most","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Well done on this Customer Service.\n\nThe return CAN-BKK flight was on schedule but I was disappointed with the poor level of check-in staff service. And why does KA not label Priority baggage with a separate tag? On arrival in BKK it took some time for my bag to arrive mixed in with general luggage.\n\nOnce checked in there was the usual comedy to get airside but T2 at CAN is modern and has decent shopping and club facilities.\n\nFlight boarded on time, the crew were BKK based as this flight is a turnaround and were friendly and efficient. However, the food service offered was dismal, (see photo of inedible pastry pie), and the wine glasses are so small that when half filled you barely get three sips before empty.\n\nFor the 3 hour flight this is a good service between Bangkok and Guangzhou with reasonable pricing but with only one flight a day does risk delays. The 787 service is better than the China Southern 737 service but Thai Airways A350 service is over the horizon better.\n\nRegret KA to meet expectations and for long haul the 2-2-2 in Business is outdated.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/24/1d/ab/4d/rockpanel.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockpanel","crvsd":"Rockpanel wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"Rockpanel","default":"Florence, Kentucky","phmbo":"62 contributions","phmbo1":"52 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Guangzhou - Bangkok","dmrsr2":"Southeast Asia","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r707112536-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Decent Business service between on the Bangkok to Guangzhou route","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The plane was small, leg room was average and the seat was relatively comfortable. In flight entertainment system was awful, very old, the touch response was not very good, and as someone who's very aware of not trying to bang the person in front of me's headrest to navigate through the movies, it was quite frustrating.

Staff were very good and very friendly. Top marks here.\n\nSecond flight - Nairobi to Dubai - was an hour late arriving and taking off and landing (\"operational reasons\") and KA staff at the Nairobi terminal were surly and unhelpful. Once airborne, food was once again meagre in quantity but tasty, white wine again was nice, in flight entertainment however was non existent (no screens in seats, and dropdown screens in ceilings every three rows were not operational) - for a six hour flight this was a bit of a pain. Flight staff were fine apart from one stewardess who was clearly tired and snappy.\n\nSo in a nutshell I think KA is suffering a bit from lack of cash.

My connection flight was from KIA to Addis Ababa and the ticket that I received shows 7 hours waiting hours in JKIA until midnight. I approached to the counter to request weather I can get an accommodation for this waiting period since the flight is rescheduled while I was flying from KIA Tanzania. A gentleman there explained that was not allowed. I asked to the reason why this is not put on the ticket that I print and there is no reason for me to wait for nearly 8 hours in the terminal while they are the one who changed the flight. He send me to  the another madam whom he said is a \"supervisor\" whom I don't think that she is. It is on stage that the aforementioned  colleagues just get into the dialogue where she made it personal and was blaming me for not knowing the terms and conditions. This ticket was bought by my company and was asked to check a name because that is where I get a trouble with oftentimes when I travel. However, even if I was not the one who bought this ticket she personally was attacking me with venom words in front of other passengers as if I did something wrong or take advantage of anything there. Knowing that this things must have been sorted out when the tickets were bought which I realized very late, was asking if there is any other flight before that hours that I may catch. But this colleague was keep intervening on this conversation and keep embarrassing me. They even refused to call a supervisor seeing that she is clearly misbehaving and make a team later on to offend me more.My flight delayed in the first instance and informed very late and on top of that this incident made very upset with your airline service! What is worse, when I reach in my destination Addis Ababa, my luggage wasn't there!

On both occasions our experience has been not good.\n\nThis time I was on a holiday with my family to Cape Town, South Africa. I found their timings perfect to CPT hence booked on KQ. Journey to CPT was good expect that there is no in-flight entertainment on a flight with more than 5 hours. You have to kill you time somehow. Food was average, can't complain. Legroom very good and spacious. A serious issue was with cabin temperature, It really feels hot inside in-spite of requesting flight attendants it was overlooked. As I mentioned earlier, my family had faced this issue earlier.\n\nMy nightmare starts with the return flight on 7th of Aug. Flight delayed by 1 hour 45 min. No information from the airline till we reach CPT airport. So we miss our connecting flight. We were booked for another connecting flight at 6.45 Once I landed in Nairobi, I approached the transit help desk, who informed that we will be given hotel accommodation. We proceed to immigration and complete formalities after 45 minutes. Next we go the the counter where they were providing us hotel vouchers. The time was around 2 am in the morning. To our surprise, the staff informs us that we will be picked up for the flight from the hotel at 3 am. That was not cool. So I got my flight rescheduled for 8.30 am so that I can take some rest. It took us a long wait to get to the shuttle and another 40 minutes to reach the hotel. Imagine all this happening early in the morning after a long flight. The shuttle picked us up at 5 am. Next, I arrive at my destination to find out that my baggage was left behind at Nairobi. Reason, time between connecting flight very less. How much time do you take to transfer a bag from one flight to another? We arrived NBO at 23.30 hrs. More than 8 hours to transfer bags!!\n\nAll accepted, what was not appealing was the way things were being handled at the KQ help desks. Staff least bothered and were working at their own pace. Once I had to ask them if we have to sleep at the airport.\n\nIt seems flight delays are very common in KQ. This was voiced by many of my friends. The last flight my wife took to travel was delayed as well resulting in missing a non KQ flight. That was a non refundable ticket.

I've done the direct Nairobi to JFK flight a couple of times now, and I greatly enjoy the flight (large plane - the Dreamliner, good food, good selection of movies, friendly and helpful staff). However, I've also flown quite a bit on Kenya Airways from Kigali to Nairobi and from Nairobi to Mauritius, and these flights are not always as great in terms of service or experience. There are often delays in the flights - a couple of times they have delayed the flight by several hours and sent a message ahead of time, but other times they don't tell you until you are at the airport. This means that I am afraid to have a short layover in Nairobi, and often end up booking a lengthy layover to avoid delays making me miss my connection. Boarding experience in Nairobi could be much better managed as well. If you pay for the extra leg room seats, they have you board in the last group. You may or may not get personal screens on the shorter flights, depending on the plane, but if you do, the selection is very sparse, not like the selection for the 14 hour flight. I'll continue to take Kenya Airways for their direct Nairobi to JFK flight, because the price can't be beat, but for shorter trips I'd prefer other carriers.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/25/f2/4e/laurel-s1717.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurel_s1717","crvsd":"laurel_s1717 wrote a review Aug 2019","ui_header_link":"laurel_s1717","default":"Kigali, Rwanda","phmbo":"142 contributions","phmbo1":"53 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - New York City","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r698039670-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Better for longer flights","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At Kigali we needed to check in an extra bag and were told we needed to pay for it in cash. We did not have enough cash on us and we were struggling with the ATMs. It was a really strenuous moment, there we were in a foreign land anxious to go home and it looked as though we would leave a bag behind. The Kenya Airways staff at the counter were supportive, empathetic and yet conscious not to delay the whole fight. eventually, we managed to scrap together the required cash and paid. Buy this time the flights about to close, we had RWF 50,000 and needed to have paid about RWF47,000. of course were weren't bothered with change at that point and were happy to just make it into our flight. Just before the flight doors closed, in entered the same Kenya Airways staff to who we had paid for the bags. he had rushed after us with the RWF 3,000 change. such honesty and diligence you do not see often. I am sad I did not get the gentleman's name.

We flew JFK to Nairobi non-stop on June 29th and returning on July 11th.\nFirstly, the customer service is unbelievably terrible. Every stewardess on the airline was rude, dull, and never helped ever. They rolled and huffed and puffed their eyes when you kindly requested something as simple as some water (flight was over 14 1/2 hours).\nSecondly, they refused to accommodate anyone for seat changes, even when the customer is paying the upcharge.\nThird, we requested to get skymiles added from this trip and they refuse to give us our credit due to our \"class\". They are a part of the SkyTeam. We spent extra money on exit row seats and spent a lot of money for the tickets. How are we not getting any mileage credit built up from this. This is probably the number one reason I will never fly with this airline ever again. I am so angry with this.\nBathrooms were always dirty and never cleaned or restocked. There was several times that I had to walk to the back of the plane to find a stewardess and ask them to put more toilet paper in the bathroom or if there was any way they could clean the urine off the floor in every single one of the bathrooms.\nWe paid for exit seats for the additional leg room and the stewardesses never said anything to the 15 people that decided to congregate in my extra leg room area and stand there conversating for over 2 hrs. I asked them kindly to relocate several times and even said something to the stewardesses several times. Finally, they moved after I had to make them (very frustrating). I didnt pay all this extra money for me not to be able to extend my legs.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this airline is they got us from point A to point B.

After 45 minutes (at aud1.50 a minute) On the phone I finally arranged a refund and purchased a new ticket (aud380) for departure that night. Interestingly, when cancelling, I called Expedia who the ticket was booked thru. Expedia pleaded with Kenya airways in Nairobi only to be told kenya airways India office had to authorise the refund - go figure. Refund comes in 8 weeks :-(. In total about 200aud out of pocket as the new ticket is more expensive and the phone bill will be crazy. What is more worrying is the failure to inform passengers - it was lucky I tried to check in on line.

We were informed that the airline staff needed a rest break- we were annoyed at this as it shows how unorganised the airline is! Why do they not have enough staff? When we returned to the airport at 8:00pm for our delayed flight we went to the gate where yet again we were late boarding. We started boarding our flight at 21:30 even though the flight was meant to depart then! When we were getting our boarding passes checked at the gate, the staff member who was checking our passes instructed us to show her our hotel booking and our return flight (even though we were not flying with them on our return). I asked why she needed to see this information and she was very rude back not giving a reason just stating she needed to see both. We were not connected to Wifi or internet so this was merely impossible but she kept us back whilst letting other passengers on without any questions asked. This was very infuriating as we had been travelling now for nearly 16 hours. She EVENTUALLY let us on the flight as another colleague told her to let us on. The airline did not have TVs, little legroom and again the flight attendants were not present often. I will not be flying with KA again as the rudeness of the staff was unnecessary on top of the delayed flight. Please think twice before booking, I would rather pay more and get a friendly and efficient service with another Airline such as Emirates.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LWa94","crvsd":"LW94 wrote a review Jul 2019","ui_header_link":"LW94","default":"","phmbo":"4 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Dubai - Mahebourg","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r690854840-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Very unorganised and staff who were not interested- delayed flight","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was no information from the Kenya Airways staff and the information board continued to state that the flight was on time. Only after a large number of irate passemgers demanded to know what was going on, they said that the flight was delayed due to air traffic problems at Nairobi and no aircraft could take off. However, there was an aircraft due and that this would get us to Nairobi in time, and as many of us from many countries had connecting flights they would advise BA of the problem and they would hold up the Heathrow flight for us. When we arrived at Nairobi at 23.30, the gates were shut and the flight was taking off on time. BA denied receiving any contact from Kenya Airways.\nBA were no help and told a large party of passengers to go to Kenya Airways ticket office as it was their fault and they should sort it out. They refused to speak to KA. So at midnight we had to queue at the KA ticket desk to try and book seats for the next day. Our contract was from Mombasa to Heathrow straight through so we had a free booking. Others who booked separate flights had to pay, one couple paying $2000 to get to London. We eventually got a flight at 8.00 the next morning to Amsterdam and to London City Airport. Our luggage arrived 4 days later.\nDuring the flight over, we had a 2 hour wait at Nairobi as the aircraft for Mombasa had not arrived.

However that experience was ruined on my returning flight. Upon check in we were informed that the flight will be delayed but I was till assured that I will be on time for my connecting flight. As I was travelling at night and wasnt able to have a once of sleep during the flight. I was looking forward to my connecting flight to dar where I had booked a hotel to rest.\n\nDue to the delay and the fact that we stayed in the plane for more than 20 minutes after landing I ended up missing my connecting flight. They have a customer service desk at the airport which proved to be useless considering the level of service I received. The lady was impolite and I was simply told we have put you in the next flight which was 7 hours later and gave me a voucher for breakfast (which was the worst thing ever. one piece of toast and an egg which is fried in too much oil.) Considering that they made me miss my reservation at the hotel that I was staying at when I asked the lady if there will be any compensation for the booking that I was missing due to all these unnecessary changes. I was told that whatever arrangement I had after the booking was non of their business. So I ended up missing my $120 amount that I paid for the one night hotel in Dar.\n\nConsidering the level of the company and the service that I received from them. I wouldnt recommend anyone.

This information was not shared when booking the flight. Because of this hop, delay is practically inevitable. It took forever for people to get off and on the plane again. Since Antananarivo was our final destination, it did not cause us any troubles.\nIt became a problem when we wanted to get back home again after our holiday. Once again, the hop in Moroni took too long, so the plane arrived an hour late, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Nairobi. Even though we missed the flight by 10 minutes, and the connecting flight was still standing at the gate right next to the one we arrived at, they decided not to wait for us and several other passengers.\nAfter missing the flight, sadly, we had to deal with their customer service, which meant that we were sent everywhere throughout Nairobi airport, dealing with staff that could not care less, and each and every one of them told us different stories where to go to. I lost count of the amount of times we had to go through airport security again and again and again. It was a very frustrating process to go through.\n\nNeedless to say we were very happy that the next flight leaving for Amsterdam was a KLM flight! Still, Murphy's law applied, so of course our luggage got lost as well for three days.\n\nThe entertainment on the first Kenya Airways flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was OK, were it not for my headphone jacket to be broken (several other passengers experienced the same problem), so I could not watch any movies whatsoever, which sucks on a 7+ hours night flight. Also, you barely get any water, even though their planes are unusually hot. It caused me to have a severe cough for about a week and a half. They serve your food within one hour after departing, and after that you will barely see the staff again.\n\nNext time around, I'd rather risk a strike than ever flying with Kenya Airways again. I've flown quite a lot already, but never have I experienced an Airline this disorganized.\n\nWhen I read other comments on here as well, it seems they're delayed quite often, caused by their own incompetence. Please consider this before booking a flight with Kenya Airways.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zjan1991","crvsd":"Jeanne wrote a review Jul 2019","ui_header_link":"Jeanne","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Antananarivo - Amsterdam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r688063069-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Worst airline experience so far","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were immediately advised that we had been booked for an alternative flight to Dar-Es-Salaam. When we enquired about our luggage that had been checked in all the way to Zanzibar, we were told not to worry, that our luggage would be going on all flights along with us.\n\nTo cut a long story short, whe we arrived in Zanzibar, almost 7 hours later than intended, our luggage was missing.\n\nIt was a mission tracking it down as, although they have an app, email, telephones and social media, Kenya Airways does not care to communicate with their passangers.\n\nRegretfully, our flight back was with Kenya Airways...

My ticket was in economy and very cheap. I bid for an upgrade for the 1st leg and it was accepted 2 days before and they reissued ticket. However, due to serious delays by Cathay Pacific entering Dubai (from Saigon and Hongkong), I realised almost a day before that I would not be able to make my trip from DXB. I cancelled my online check-in’s to avoid No Show, but had to forfeit upgrade and tickets according to fare rules. However, KQ, and in particular the Station Manager in DXB, went the extra mile to still get me on board on the following flight 5 hours later on the same day. This, without reissuing tickets (which were non refundable), without charging me for No Show, without loosing my upgrade, just out of courtesy, empathy and a well explained case from my side. At gate in DXB, I was the last person (had only 40 Minutes for transfer, so got a good morning run!), but KQ issued all my BPs in 2 Minutes during last call. Onboard, spacious cabin, got seat 2C in a nice 2 x 2 x 2 configuration. Flight full except a few seats in business. Good food and kind, attentive FAs. A decent airline respecting classic values and handles “ground situations” or irregularities well. Not the first time they have done small miracles for me. In NBO, I was kindly invited to the KQ Pride lounge that Skyteam uses. Just a courtesy due to my endured inconveniences.  Last leg on an E190, I love this aircraft. Dinner and drinks served in a good atmosphere due to fresh FAs. Well done, KQ, outstanding service: I owe you for this one! And my home-travel is still valid. What more could you have done?

Overall we were quite satisfied. Very punctual, friendly cabin crews, clean aircrafts. On the way back from Nairobi to Cape Town there was no entertainment system, which was sad on a nearly 6 hours flight. We also experienced a 3 hours delay in Nairobi on our way back home, but that was not caused by the airline, it was a weather issue in Cape Town as we were told. Nairobi airport however is not a pleasant place. Probably the worst airport we/I have seen. Old, poor offer on restaurants/cafés, rather dirty. This is strange since Nairobi may be a hub for eastern Africa, one could immagine. But again, we cannot say much against the Airline though. They definitely beat American Airlines though (that was our worst airline experience so far a few years ago).","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonsee","crvsd":"MarMont wrote a review Jun 2019","ui_header_link":"MarMont","default":"Cape Town, South Africa","phmbo":"7 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r685189298-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"First time and quite ok","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Entertainment was good and food had improved considerably. Veg options were readily available but you can book a special needs meal in advance. Both flights were on time which was a change from my previous experience.A good duty free selection on flight with reasonable prices.

First, I was never notified that one of my connecting flights from Cairo to Kenya was cancelled. I’ve found out that the main reason I came to Cairo has been cancelled and need to change my flight in order to go back to work before my scheduled flight, this is how I found out about the flight cancellation.\n\nSecondly, I attempted to contact Kenya Airways through multiple different avenues, by phone, email, and live chat. I have records of how many attempts I made to contact them via email and have not heard any response. When I would call, no one would pick up, and when I used the Live Chat, it would constantly disconnect and it would take 30 minutes for someone to even come to the chat room to help me. After getting frustrated and being unable to resolve the problem. I found out that it would be cheaper for me to have my flight refunded and purchase a new one. I made two requests online to have my flight refunded but again, no one has gotten back to me.\n\nFinally, I contact the office in Cairo and all they could offer me was a flight change, with no cost, on a day that I cannot take (June 30th, which would be too late) or a flight change on June 29th, but with a $550 increase, it would be much cheaper for me to just buy a new ticket elsewhere. After all this trouble over the past four days, I expect some compensation or assistance. At this point, I hope you will take this matter seriously and I wish to be fully covered for the flight on June 29 that was offered to me, or a full refund for the flight I have already purchased. I have never experienced such terrible communication with an airline before and I am extremely disappointed. My next step is to contact the Key Executives and Board Members of your airline, which I have a list of:\n\nMichael Joseph, Sebastian Mikosz, Jason Kap-kirowk, Caroline Armstrong-Ogwapit, Martin Luke Oduor-Otieno, among many others. I look forward to hearing back from you promptly.

Paying for extra flights and hotels in the process.\n\nUpon time to leave on the 8th June for London we were informed at checking that we infact had a flight for the 5th to London booked by the Kenya Airways representatives at Zanzibar. This flight was never communicated to us in any form (I had emails from after the flight on 5th asking if I’ll require an upgrade for my flight on the 8th).\n\nWe arrived at the airport in Nairobi at 5:30am at which point we had 3.5hours to resolve the issue. It initially started with the sales representative and manager claiming our boarding passes for 5th June were printed. After digging into it they then realised not only was it not printed but we weren’t even checked in. We were made to sit in the sales office with the promise that someone had spoken to the controller only to then be told we weren’t boarding our intended flight with no compensation for the now extra day we’d spend in Nairobi (more costs incurred due to Kenya Airways).\n\nFast forward to the following day and we were able to obtain a ticket on the London flight. After going through check-in, passport control and security I was stopped at the boarding gate as they refused to accept my residence permit for the UK (it was checked and validated at checking and passport control. This is a permit I’ve been flying with for 8 years with several UK entry stamps in my passports (new and old) all referring to the said document number.\n\nI was now staying in Kenya for another day as it was Sunday and contacting the embassy wasn’t an option (incurring more costs). My partner who is a UK citizen got on the flight as she was informed she’d have to pay for a whole new ticket if she decided to stay. Upon arrival in London my partner was shocked to hear they hadn’t loaded our bags onto the plane despite checking them in a day early for the flight. In fact I was left in Kenya with no funds or clothes and she was now in England with none of our luggage.\n\nKenya airways offered no compensation at any point for the now 3 nights we had to spend in Nairobi.\n\nI had to rebook through KLM the following day (more costs), who were happy with the same document and travel to the UK and the UK authorities were also happy to accept me back home.\n\nNow the luggage has arrived, the case as well as things within the case are damaged.\n\nSo my honeymoon (once in a lifetime experience) was essentially completely ruined by Kenya Airways. Me and my partner believe that we were treated unfairly and discriminated by Kenya airways based on my passport and being a western African national.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I19PNelizabetha","crvsd":"Elizabeth A wrote a review Jun 2019","ui_header_link":"Elizabeth A","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r682625708-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Honeymoon Nightmare- Worst experience ever","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Had to pay for extra bag (we had three bags between two people). No big deal. Flight was on time, good flight.\n\nLeg 2 - Nairobi to Mombasa. This was now a domestic flight so we had to lug all our luggage to the domestic terminal after fetching it in Nairobi and clearing Customs. Again no big deal and expected. However, the Business class lounge in Nairobi domestic terminal was very small and we had to sit outside for hours awaiting our connecting flight.\n\nLeg 3 - Mombasa to Nairobi - this was the flight from hell! Got delayed 3 1/2 hours (several other flights also got delayed - all Kenya airways) and we had only 30 minutes to spare to get from the domestic terminal in Nairobi, to the International terminal, go through security twice (two different areas) plus go through outgoing immigration. We barely made it and were the last ones to board our flight to Paris with minutes to spare. We would like to thank Vivian of Kenya Airlines in Mombasa for helping us get through some issues with luggage and going above and beyond. She is a good employee!\n\nLeg 4 - Nairobi to Paris. This was an uneventful flight. However, it should be noted that Kenya Airlines served very basic and cheap food for an international flight.\n\nNote to Kenya Air - You may need to invest in some research as to what other airlines do and not cut corners on business class meals!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415samb","crvsd":"Sam B wrote a review Jun 2019","ui_header_link":"Sam B","default":"Seattle, Washington","phmbo":"88 contributions","phmbo1":"82 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Paris","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r682483605-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"A variety of experiences on four different legs!","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I am traveling to Malawi for a mission trip, and traveling afterwards since this may be my only chance to visit Africa. One way flights are significantly more expensive than round trip flights, so I booked my round trip flight with a connection in Kenya. This way, I could travel to a couple of nearby countries (including Kenya) and then jump on the second connection flight from Kenya to the USA (by missing my first flight from Malawi to Kenya). This would have made my travels throughout Africa work out seamlessly. We called the company to ensure everything would work out, and they told us that we have to buy a completely new one way trip back to America if we miss any one of the bundled flights...even though we are already paying an incredible amount for this set of flights. This money-hungry company THREW A HUGE WRENCH IN MY ENTIRE VACATION. I now may never get a chance to visit Kenya or the other countries that I planned to visit.  It should be the customer's choice how they want to travel and use the flights that they paid for. The customer does NOT come first for Kenya Airways. I am disgusted with this service. (Also, this is incredibly stupid business move since you just lost your country hundreds of dollars in tourism from the flights and hotels that I would've paid for to travel in Kenya before heading back to America.)","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeMeAnywhere12","crvsd":"Traveler wrote a review Jun 2019","ui_header_link":"Traveler","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Lilongwe - New York City","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r680951465-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The Customer Does NOT Come First","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Reviews of Kenya Airways aren’t generally great but I found their business class service of a high standard. It was a long way to go in a narrow bodied aircraft so you cannot compare the seating with the lie flat seats of most wide bodied aircraft but it was very comfortable nevertheless. Both flights were on time and transiting through Nairobi airport was quick and easy.

Tired to save some money by using this airline and got what we deserved.

Not easy to explain an autistic 6 years old why we not going on our way. Than on the flight from Nairobi to Capetown my husband got very sick and I had to asked for help as he already used all the vomit bags they had and running high fever and they just gave me an upset face and saying sorry we don’t have any pain killers, they did not offer any help  so I asked them can you please bring a doc to the plane when we land as my husband is very very sick so the head flight attendant said “we can do it but only after all the people go” and I said what if my husband is dying here still no comment. Thank god for Capetown airport helpers, which help us get out of the airport quickly to go to the hospital.

Got my ticket reissued in airport in ADD due to No Show (I was late from previous connection on different ticket). That costed me 300 usd, same amount as I paid for original (return) ticket. The Station Manager in ADD went the extra mile to get me onwards the same day and he invited me to the Ethiopian Gold Lounge, that Skyteam uses.\nService onboard fair, but food is ridiculous and substandard. They serve only microscopic meals, e.g. a little-finger sized hot roll snack from ADD to NBO (5 hours trip). That’s stingy. In NBO I had to spent the night but fortunately KQ granted me lounge access due to all the trouble that I have had. The prestigious lounge has food, views, and nice architecture with curving designs and view of tarmac. It has 6 beds in silent area and I slept well till next morning. Flights less than ½ hours delayed. NBO-KGL on the Embraer was delayed due to passengers could not fit their overhead luggage into the narrow space and some 5-10 pax was deprived their luggage to have it inscribed on site and put down in luggage room until we reached KGL. For me a dramatic flight as I had 6 BPs issued with KQ and lost 2 connections from ADD but the station manager did well to rebook me. KQ has lowered services onboard but remain strong when things go wrong.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/0c/0f/6a/385andersp.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385andersp","crvsd":"385andersp wrote a review May 2019","ui_header_link":"385andersp","default":"Hue, Vietnam","phmbo":"36 contributions","phmbo1":"44 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Addis Ababa - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r674726523-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Fairly strong when things go wrong...","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Aircrafts were the old Dreamliner 787-800 and 737, respectively. I like KQ (we have had our issues…). In BKK they were professional and appeared as a true legacy carrier This, even I travelled on a strongly promoted ticket. Smooth cooperation with KQ and the AF lounge in BKK allowed me to relax in the lounge 6 hours until Kenya Airways could issue all 4 Boarding Passes of my ongoing trip to Kigali via Addis. Buying 2 tickets with complicated routing (married segments) turned out to be much cheaper than go direct. But time spent increases; likewise the risk of lapses. All flights punctual. Food only passable, only 2 options offered and only cold dishes for dinner. No cheese, no ice-cream. Other airlines do better in Economy regarding food. Drinks also very narrow offering with 2 industrial, cheap beers. Same for wines: only 1-2 options. Champagne offered (on both flights) was fine: JM Gobillard & Fils. The Dreamliner offer a very boring and cramped layout of 2 x 2 x 2 in 5 rows. Business almost full (only 4 vacant seats) and economy completely full (but no operational upgrades were done). Second flight almost empty. Poor food, only a quiche in a paper box offered as breakfast. And, this was business class..?? FAs in excellent mood. Had 50 minutes turnaround time in ADD which I failed to complete in time due to no prior notification by KQ aircrew to ground staff to rush me through.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/0c/0f/6a/385andersp.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385andersp","crvsd":"385andersp wrote a review May 2019","ui_header_link":"385andersp","default":"Hue, Vietnam","phmbo":"36 contributions","phmbo1":"44 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Addis Ababa","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r674725906-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Fine product if price is right!","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I hold a Gold Medallion Status on Delta Airlines, with whom KQ is a SkyTeam partner. I shall rate this airline under three rubrics: Counter service, Cabin service and Customer service.\n*COUNTER service - outward journey*\nWe checked in at JFK with no issues. As a Gold Medallion Delta customer, I received Sky Priority Status on KQ. My wife, as my travel companion on the same reservation, also received Sky Priority status. The counter clerk was friendly and efficient. The boarding process is a bit chaotic. KQ does not have clearly bordered-off lanes, so passengers cluster and converge, causing priority boarders to find themselves prevented by economy boarders, thus nullifying the priority boarding process.\n*CABIN service - outward journey*\nI did not find a \"wow!\" moment with any of KQ's meals. I found the flight attendants to be reasonably attentive, but not necessarily eager to please. My next comments are among the chief reasons I shall never fly KQ on a long distance flight ever again. First, for a transatlantic aircraft involving a 14 hour flight to have no wifi is like having a flight with no electricity. But wait! There WAS no electricity (in a manner of speaking) on this flight in my seat. The entertainment system did not work. OK, so I could entertain myself by reading, I thought. Hell no! Neither did the overhead lamp work. This was true of all the persons in 19 G, H, and J, and the fellow in 18 G appeared to have the same problem. This was no mere inconvenience; it resulted in loss of work; for I did have work to complete while flying which I now could not; already disadvantaged by the lack of wifi which I had already anticipated. My wife was in 19 F. I and the 19 H passenger drew the attention to these fails more than once to more than three flight attendants. No change of seat was offered economy appeared to be full) and as a priority boarder who entered among the first batch of economy boarders, I noted that business class was nearly empty. Still, the flight attendants offered no apology or options - just surprise that the systems did not work. Make your own conclusion from those details.\n*CUSTOMER service - between outward and inward journeys*\nThis is where KQ has completely lost me. I wrote KQ customer service, indicating the problems outlined above, and suggested (knowing it might have been a long shot) that a fair compensation for the inconvenience and loss of work could be an upgrade to business class on the return home. Even though KQ's automated response says they prioritize upcoming flights issues, I had to write KQ twice - once two days after arrival, and another time four days later (two days before departure) to get a response. The response was not only disappointing, but left me embarrassed at the airline. I felt like I was dealing with a child, caught with hands in the cookie jar and yet claiming it was his sister who was stealing the cookies.\nKQ responded that only ONE entertainment cluster on the entire aircraft did not work and that \"the flight attendants resolved the matter satisfactorily.\" They indicated that they could not upgrade us to business class, and ended the email with an apology for the entertainment module (no apology for loss of work, no reference to overhead light, and NO alternative compensation offered for the inconvenience suffered for 14 hours, or my loss of work.\nI replied to KQ, trying to remain calm, trying to avoid calling them a liar, and trying to avoid threatening to use all my influence to warn Delta that this airline could tank their record. I succeeded in being polite and calm and used the carrot rather than stick. I never got a response. It is embarrassing for an international airline to LIE and be defensive about a failure rather than accept responsibility and compensate the passenger reasonably. I can't spend my money on KQ again, unless I have no other serious choice.\nBefore I made this trip, I addressed a question about expectations regarding my Medallion status and transferring of benefits to KQ from DL. Although Delta responded later, KQ's response was more vague than DL's (neither answered as clearly as I think they could have, my specific questions).\n*COUNTER service - inward journey*\nBecause of a crowd at the baggage counters, I and my wife ended up being checked in at NBO separately. Only when we cleared immigration did we notice that we both had boarding passes in -- get this -- my name and both, naturally, included \"sky priority.\" So we proceeded to the lounge expecting that the error would be sorted out while we rested. Because KQ did not grant my wife the same sky priority status as they did on the outward journey, we ended up having to pay for her use of the lounge.\n*CABIN service - inward journey*\nYou won't be surprised to learn that my wife's seat, 20F, would not recline. For 16 hours (the flight was delayed) she sat upright. I am not going to bother complaining, lest KQ lies again. Additionally, the flight attendants this time were not as service-oriented as they were before. Drinks were at a minimum; the food was noticeably of a lesser quality.\nDuring a portion of the flight, I felt unwell, and alerted my wife that I thought I was going to faint or otherwise pass out (I know this feeling and I'm both surprised and grateful that it did not eventually happen). During that time, she went to the galley at the rear (she did not use call button) and mentioned this to a flight attendant who asked the seat number. She said she thought the attendant would come by to investigate. It never happened. Perhaps they might have, if an emergency did arise.\nFor short flights, with no competition, I'll fly KQ.

The first time in over seven years for us. We looked for a direct flight, and we found it difficult getting one, mostly due to the current state of Nigeria’s air travel. We settled for Kenya Airways, partly because it is an African airline partly because they just opened up their New York to Nairobi route, and partly because it was affordable. This has now become the worse decision we have made as a family. The first leg of our trip from New York to Nairobi on April 17, started off well for us. We took the family car, to the airport. I took our luggages inside; we were there 1 1/2 hours before scheduled takeoff. Their representatives at the airport starting checking us in and, I got the clear from them to go and park the car at the JFK’s airport long term parking, while they continued our check-in at the counter for us with my wife and kids. Right before I reach the long term parking at JFK airport, my wife called. She said that the airline representatives at the counter said two of our three luggage’s were overweight, they were insisting on us paying $200 in fees for that, In spite of the fact we were entitled to eight pieces of luggage for four of us, and we only took three. My wife was not with her cards there, or cash, she asked them if they would agree to use the card number, Apple Pay or other forms of payment, they refused.  I was also begging them to wait on the phone, I was about 2- 5 mins away from the boarding desk, as I had called an Uber to take me there instead of using an air train. They representatives refused and proceed to snatch the boarding pass and out baggage tags from my wife’s hands, while she was carrying our 11-month-old in one hand and out 5-year old in the other. I got there within the 2-5 minutes with 49 minutes to takeoff. They had closed their counter, they had no staff insight, and neither did they have an office in New York, as we got to find out. We started calling their phone number listed for U.S., the people we spoke with refused to be helpful in any way, either with us boarding the flight or giving us the next flight, demanding that we pay over $4000 for the airline to take us to Lagos, Nigeria. We were stranded at the airport after the flight left with a few other passengers throughout the afternoon. In-between the back and forth between us, the airline and the booking agents, Cheap-o-Air, we decided to take another flight. There times we put them all on conference calls to try and find a solution(s). Including calling Kenya Airways head office in Nairobi, Kenya.  We spent over six hours between me and my wife, trying to find a solution with no success of any kind. Then next thing we tried to do for us to go our trip was to try book a flight with Air Italy, which was the only airline that had a flight which could take us to Nigeria, that day. They had a flight was to leave at 8.30 p.m., that day.  Only to find out our luggage’s had left with the airline to Nairobi, contrary everything they said, including the threats, assaults and intimidations at the Kenya Airways boarding gate previously that day. We could not leave with the Air Italy flight that day. We went home and manage to book a flight with Air Morocco for that Friday at 2 a.m., while trying to sort things out with the airline to get compensation. We started the process for next couple days of trying to get our luggage delivered to us where ever we would be, because of time our constraints, brought about by this fiascos. We got to Lagos, Nigeria on Saturday morning at 5 a.m., we went to Kenya airways office and could not get our bags. After a back and forth with the Kenyan airways officials at the airport, we located our bags that late that Saturday afternoon at about 4 p.m. On to our return trip, this was supposed to be on April 27, which we planned as such, because my wife and I had work on Monday. We got to the airport in Lagos, two hours 20 minutes before takeoff, we checked-in, started going through the formalities, and when we were supposed to receive our boarding pass we were told that we were not on the flight list. That we had our ticket suspended because we missed the first leg of our flight, and in all the days and hours of communication, with Kenya Airways in New York, Nairobi and Lagos nobody told us they would be suspending our ticket. That we needed to call them for in their words “too see if there would have been anything they can do for us,” or just cancel our entire ticket for missing the first part of our trip.Even the booking agent’s cheap-o-Air was not informed by Kenya Airways and they did not inform us. We had to scramble, to get back as quickly as possible, calling some of our friends back in New York, to help us book a flight from there because we could not use our debit cards to book tickets from Lagos, Nigeria. All the while we had to call relatives to sleep at their place, because oblivious as usual Kenya Airways did not even give us a hotel to stay in or help out in any way. We went back and forth in Lagos, Nigeria, with Kenya airways officials in Lagos (who were not really helpful), their officials in Nairobi (who found it hard talking calls, and were almost useless), and their JFK manager (who found it hard contributing). We also spoke with the booking agents who sent it to their escalation team, while doing everything to try and resolve the situation, including trying to speak with the Kenya Airways staff in Lagos and Nairobi. They both said the only person who could do anything about it the JFK manager, who did not respond calls or emails. We eventually had success with an Emirates flight to New York. We heard from the Kenya Airways airline on Sunday evening, Dubai time, all they said was the error was regretted and that the return leg ticket should be re-issued to us at no cost. No mention of all the other expenses we have incurred from the start, till now, plus the lost time wages. Well over $10000 at this time, all the pain and trauma.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emekamikeo","crvsd":"Emeka Mike O wrote a review May 2019","ui_header_link":"Emeka Mike O","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Lagos","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r670776496-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"An airline from hell","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Our outward flight delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues. Staff were very friendly and professional during this time. Offered juices, tea & coffee along with croissant. Our return flight Sunday 28th April at 9:50am departure was not great. We arrived at airport as per the timeframe given by airline. When we arrived security asked why are we here so early, no staff to do check in yet!!\nThis was only the beginning of worst things to come?\nAt about 8:00am we were told the flight was cancelled, not once did we receive any communication by the airline. I found this very strange as we had received plenty of emails before we left Nairobi? And nothing since, It’s Tuesday today!!\nCommunication at the airport was very poor. First we were told there would be no flights today to Nairobi, then they came back to us that we got on a flight at 4:30pm with a different airline, eventually we were told we would be going to a local hotel. The hotel was the Golden Tulip in Stonetown, staff very friendly and professional. No food or refreshments we’re offered during our stay. We were picked up at the hotel at 1:00pm and our flight was at 4:30pm, not once were we offered any food or drinks, very poor.\nWhy was the flight cancelled? Why no communication? Does this airline understand customer service? Even their webpage is poor, it asks do you want to chat and I said yes, simple you would think. No as you need to be a member, so I tried to join, all you had to do was give your email address. Simple you would think. No email has been sent. So as a company if you cannot fix problems or communicate with your customers they will use other options to tell future customers be aware of poor service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrR8903LK","crvsd":"johnrR8903LK wrote a review Apr 2019","ui_header_link":"johnrR8903LK","default":"Melbourne, Australia","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r670394217-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Flight to Zanzibar and Back","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Both Expedia and Kenya Airways has been very unprofessional.   I refer to my trip which was scheduled on the 10th April 2019, I am intensely disappointed with this disastrous situation related to the service which we received  not only me and my daughter( special that was her first time) but also a group of passengers who were travelling the same day. Julia was travelling and she was very much excited to go to Paris. Firstly on the 10th we received an e-mail informing that the flight will be delayed however we decide to arrive at the airport as schedule in order to avoid any discomforts.  Upon check in I was very much anxious and I asked the Kenya Airport Rep. whether we shall be able to catch our next flight to Paris due to the flight delay. She reassured me that needful has been done in Kenya and everything will be going on smoothly Acoona matata she said to me looking at my little girl  Julia with a smile.   So we took the flight and Julia was so happy.  When we arrived in Kenya Airport we could see 2 Kenya Airways aeroplane still charging things I told my daughter that we shall probably be taking one of them.  We rushed straight to the transfer counter when reached there and asked the lady told us that the door is already closed  and that she will not be able to do anything for us then arrived the other passengers from our previous flght going to paris and also to other destinations which was in the same situation  .  Everyone could clearly see that there was nothing fishy going on and they finally mentioned that there was an overbooking situation. We were all panicking and especially me as I was in a country with my daughter with only strangers around I talking to them in English however they were talking between in a different languages which  I was not able to understand.  Finally we were advised that we have been booked on the next flight which was scheduled the next day at 23h00.  So we had no other choice than staying there.  They said that they booked us a hotel and was going to provide transfers but this was not simply at all without being offensive Kenya is not like Mauritius.   We waited long to get our luggage and were only able get them at round 02H00 and 2 of my suitcases were broken. Together with other passengers we had to walk out of the airport far away on the parking in order to van to go to the hotel without anyone from Kenya Airways to accompany us. The hotel was quite far from the airport and to our surprise some of us was booked at Tamarin Hotel which look much more secured that Weston where we stayed.  We were very uncomfortable and had no other choice than to stay inside the hotel until the evening Our pick up was at 20h00 in an old 50 seaters bus which was overcrowded and we had to stop to various security check point where we had to get out of the bus walk to security post and after get back in the bus.. Arriving at the airport we had to find out our way to the checkout points without any assistance.  Finally we left Kenya the next day arriving to Paris on the 12th April in the morning instead of the 11th April. Since the day I arrived to Paris, I spend my vacation contacting both Kenya Airways and Expedia USA (I purchased my tickets on line with Expedia) on and on.  I spend hours on Expedia Chat Customer service having each time to start over with a new person.  Expedia promised to come back to me but until today no one did.  I am extremely disappointed with both Expedia and Kenya Airways.  I even when to the office in Paris where I was told that I should deal directly with Expedia USA.  I also wrote to Kenya Airways but not a single response. Julia was so terrified and did not want to go back to Kenya.  So I wrote to both Expedia and Kenya  Airways to sort out things and to book me back on another flight but having got any reply from them I  booked another flight back to Mauriitus  Corsair airline which by the way was fantastic.  I definitely feel that I need to be compensated for everything.  This is totally inexcusable and impolite.  Our trip has been totally ruined.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569christam","crvsd":"Christa M wrote a review Apr 2019","ui_header_link":"Christa M","default":"Quatre Bornes","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Mahebourg - Paris","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r670371554-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Please help me to get back my money and my trip has been ruined by both Expedia and Kenya Airways","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

An hour's delay \"only\" is LATE. It is just not good enough in this day and age that an airline that is competing at a global level should not improve on its customer experience outside the aircraft.

Less room, crew mostly appear to wish they were somewhere else. I’ve now given up on food as not at all pleasant and small portions. Tiny portion of lettuce as a starter and hard cake piece for dessert. Plus an inadequate main. Drinks limited.  In 2 years our family of 3 made 4 return flights from London to Mombasa and each time at least one screen didn’t work. Twice a seat had broken and wouldn’t recline.

I checked in 3 hours before my flight to Nairobi this January and when my flight landed in Nairobi by bag was not on the plane.  They told me it never made the flight and when it was delivered the next day, the bag was riffled through and a jacket was missing.  Neither the email address I had been given to contact the airlines or the two telephone numbers were in service to report the stolen items, so I tried to put in a claim two days later at the Nairobi Airport.  No one had any idea how I was to proceed in filing a claim for the missing jacket.  When I returned to the U.S. I found information on the website and after filling everything out I emailed my claim.  That would not do - I had to send it by mail to Nairobi, which I did along with the receipt for the jacket that was purchased especially for the safari.  I did receive a response that they would not pay for the full amount of the jacket, but agreed to 80% of the cost.  I agreed and signed the release which also had to be sent through the US Mail.  Once they received that they asked for my bank account number and routing information so they could deposit the amount into my account.  Instead I asked that they send me a check.  That was over a month ago and today I received an email saying Kenya Airways does not send out checks.  I called my banker and he said not to give them my bank number and routing information because of potential fraud.  Just wanted to give everyone a heads up - not only do their employees rifle through your luggage and help themselves, you won't be reimbursed without jumping through multiple hoops.  Probably because of the incredibly high unemployment rate in South Africa and Kenya, this wasn't my only experience of being ripped off.  This was my 3rd trip to Africa and will be my last.  I would have liked to have been reimbursed for my jacket, but not at the risk of falling prey to another scam involving my bank account.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texlynn51","crvsd":"texlynn51 wrote a review Apr 2019","ui_header_link":"texlynn51","default":"","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"25 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r666796637-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Beware!","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Proceeded to hotel in Entebbe a few minutes away. Contacted KQ in the morning and told bag had indeed arrived the evening before and would be delivered shortly. With no sign of the bag, made several connections with KQ who advised driver delivering bag had proceeded to Kampala first (an hour's drive away) to deliver delayed bags there and would come to hotel in Entebbe on the way back. What? Driver could not be contacted on his mobile. Eventually dispatched a taxi to Kampala to buy insulin (my brands not available in Entebbe). About to make purchase when bag arrived at hotel just before 6pm. Distressing experience. Flight crew friendly. Food on this KQ short haul consisted of a tiny bread roll! Is my experience unusual? A colleague travelling back from the same venue to Lilongewe also had a similar delay experiece. Come on KQ, get your act together - my bills relating to bag dealy wiil follow.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90GerryM","crvsd":"Gerry M wrote a review Apr 2019","ui_header_link":"Gerry M","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"188 contributions","phmbo1":"38 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r665738946-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Nairobi-Entebbe: Bag Dealy Horror Experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Having spent 50% of my time on an aircraft over the past few years, I’m somewhat of a first hand on what to expect and Kenya Airways was thoroughly disappointing. On board cleanliness was abysmal as was the catering and service offered by the crew. I flew 4 sectors from Dubai via Nairobi onwards and back and I cannot say that I had one good flight.  There’s a reason why this airline is at the top when searching by price. You honestly get what you pay for. Lacklustre crew, poor food, a poor seat and an airport in Nairobi which is a joke for connecting passengers. I suggest you save your hard earned cash and pay a little more to travel on an alternative carrier - Ethiopian is excellent travelling to Africa. I would not choose to fly Kenya Airways again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodclipper","crvsd":"Rick wrote a review Apr 2019","ui_header_link":"Rick","default":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dubai - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r665690885-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Good on paper and in the adverts but the reality is so different, beware!","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The configuration in economy is 3 seats, aisle, 3 seats, aisle, 3 seats. I could not believe how small the seat was and how little leg room I had. My knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. I am not a large person and felt so cramped and I had a seat on the aisle. The poor ladies also squished into our row had it just as bad. And this was a 14 hr flight!!!! When I got up to walk around I notice the seats in the middle configuration appeared to have more leg room and not only that there were empty seats! Why cram everyone on the side configuration?? This was the longest flight I have ever taken and in the smallest seat.  The movie selection was poor, same with the music selection.  The lights were turned out shortly into the flight so turning on my overhead light disrupted others trying to sleep. What a miserable long flight. The price to upgrade to business class was $1500 for this leg and since my total round trip ticket price was$777 it did not seem worth it.  But it was a truly torturous trip in economy so maybe it would have been worth it? Other reviews I read regarding business class on Kenya airways stated not worth it.

It was a code share with KLM through shcipol to London. And honestly Kenya airways needs to style up a little. If not for their own business for the sake of KLMs name. The flight was comfortable. The seats were good and the entertainment was fine. But you need to feed your passengers properly. I had a breakfast which was too little for a child to be honest. The lunch was chicken and I got 3 bite size pieces. If its snacks you're serving, make it known so we pre plan and est before we board. The staff were pleasant but felt like they had to be there rather than other airlines I've flown with where they want to be there. That's my two cents worth, hope you read this and improve.

I was so happy to find out there was a new flight from JFK straight to Nairobi. Tickets were a bit cheaper than Emirates but I later regretted trying to saving that couple hundred bucks. First of all, the flight attendants especially the women were rude and moody! I couldn’t stop comparing with Emirates the whole time. Secondly the food was the worst ever! The only thing I like was some chicken sandwich. We would go for hours without a meal service and at one point I wished if there was a vending machine on board, I was starving. Last but not least, it was soooo cold on the plane like freezing and the blankets were supperrrr thin. I couldn’t believe it.\n\nWe then try to change our tickets and oh lawdy.... never seen anything like it. It was daylight robbery. If you go on the website or app it quoted you $400 and then when you try to pay you would get all sorts or error messages. I probably tried more than 20 times so I really think they were tampering with the online system. We then ended up calling and that’s when the real nightmare began. We probably talked to 10 different agents and they were all quoting us ridiculous fares like more than what we paid the round trip. They hung up on me more than 5 times and they would give you a weird ass long name when you asked. There is something shady going on with those change fares. I ended up buying a new ticket with emirates for 800 compared to the 1,700 Kenyan wanted to make me pay. Funny thing also is with Emirates you only pay $70 change fee and fare difference which there is usually hardly any. GO EMIRATES, BOO KENYAN!!! I’m going to report this airline to FAA or whoever can help stop this robbery. Maybe they should just operate domestically.

We were lucky to figure this out as we would have missed the flight altogether plus our next legs to NY and then Phoenix.The JFK flight left at 2300 hours and I decided to forgo dinner due to the lateness of the hour and get some sleep.  When I asked for breakfast at 0700 Kenya time, I was told that breakfast would be served NY time - 6 hours later.  After explaining that I was really hungry, not having eaten since lunch the day before (and Nairobi is such a chaotic airport that we never had time to get any food), they very reluctantly provided a dry bun and fruit.  But complained that they did not want to set a precedent for other passengers.  The general attitude was surly and they all did their best to never have any interaction with passengers.  Just trying to get a bottle of water seemed to be a problem. Not impressed at all and will never fly with them again.

I've yet to complete my return journey and hope there is room for improvement. Nevertheless, yesterday was a horrible start for me (being my first experience with KQ in 2018). I was under the impression due to increased capacity in flying to internationally, include the United States, I will be able to begin accumulating mileage with Kenya Airways, but I was sadly mistaken. The message above, was the initial complaint in December. Over the past two months I've had continuous written debate/dialogue with the airline and their \"resolution\" is 3000 miles or $100 voucher for the same airline. Without considering all of the losses I incurred during this trip. My multiple destination ticket is as follows: depart 10/12 Juba, SS to Kigali, Rwanda (transit in Nairobi), depart 14/12 Kigali, Rwanda to Nairobi (transit in Burundi), and 16/12 Nairobi to Juba, SS. Upon the first flight from Juba, there was an hour delay; as I began to notice the allotted time left, I immediately approached Kenya Airways staff, expressing my concerns. Since the flight to Kigali was 6:30 PM and due to the delay, I would arrive in Nairobi shortly before the Kigali flight departure. Their response, reflected the ability for me to join the 9PM flight by Rwandair, but the system was not allowing them to make the changes from Juba. Therefore I was recommended to immediately approach the help/transfer desk in Nairobi. As optimistic as I remained throughout my flight to Nairobi, my hopes were completely shattered. The rep (unfortunately, I don't recall her name) informed me the next available flight will be Tuesday, 11 December at 7AM. I insisted the rep make a stronger effort to grant me a seat on the Rwandair flight, due to my pending appointments/hotel bookings in Kigali. I even offered to pay a fare difference (even if the only seat available was in Business class; I will pay), but I was unsuccessful. I exclaimed, my medical condition (epilepsy) will be triggered since I failed to put enough medication in my carry on bag, but again was told I will not be able to receive my checked in bag. She offered to place me in a hotel and a free transit visa. I expressed my hotel in Kigali has been paid for and I will not be able to receive a refund, due to this occurrence, but the rep presented no comforting suggestions. Though, I continued to inform the rep, I have a doctor's appointment in Kigali (the main purpose of my short visit-1st time to the city), but she was unable to ease my concerns. Moving forward, I was sent to the rep responsible for issuing the hotel voucher. I insisted the pick-up be at 4:30, but he stated 4 AM is the most appropriate. Being a non-Kenyan; unfamiliar with the main attractions/distance from airport locations, I was placed in a hotel chosen by Kenya Airways. Unknowingly, the hotel was 40 mins away from the airport. I arrived in Nairobi at 6:30 and didn't arrive to the hotel until 8:50 PM. Nairobi was cold and rainy; in which I was highly unprepared for such temperatures causing great distress to my physical state. As an airline highly aware of Nairobi's traffic, I would assume if seeking the best interest of the client, the hotel placement would be fairly closer to airport to avoid any delays, etc. Again, it proved Kenya Airways to be highly insensitive towards the customers. To add insult to injury:•             Since I didn't have enough medication, to prevent a seizure I will have to remain distracted and awake (seizures happen while I'm asleep)•             Without access to my checked in bag, I was unable to shower and struggled to brush my teeth until I borrowed from another hotel guest.•             We were collected from the hotel at 4:15 AM, in the rain; during checkpoint all of the passengers had to disembark from the shuttle bus (in the cold and heavy rain, which I did not have on appropriate attire).•             Upon arrival at the airport, we were dropped much further from the departures' entrance, causing me to run under the rain again.Due to the change of flight, I was unable to see the doctor as planned today. I plan to do a \"walk-in\" tomorrow, with the hope to receive an opening (which is unpredictable). My four nights trip was shortened to 3 nights and I pray I'm able to receive my medical check-up as planned. This detailed message is written to express the series of events, which has occurred in the last 24 hours. Since, the airport was unable to provide sufficient support nor compensation, I hope this online customer relations is willing to assist in addressing my concerns, struggles and much more which can never be repaid by the airline. Nevertheless, I expect Kenya Airways to display a sense of emotion and care for their client, through a compensation of sorts.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unmiss_juba","crvsd":"W.

Our journey started at Cape Town International Airport where our flight left with a delay of five hours heading to Nairobi. Due to our delay which was marked by almost no communication/miscommunication by the crew and the grounded staff we couldn´t manage to get our connecting flight to Zanzibar. Throughout our journey, they managed to maintain an almost ridiculously low level in customer service which seems to affect all levels from normal staff up to supervisor and manager. Corporate Identity but for sure in the worst way possible.There was no sign at all that the airline staff tried to find solutions for the upcoming problems. However, when we were based in Nairobi we were heading to their so-called \"pride of Africa\" lounge which was actually a very nice place to stay if you are able to afford the extra fee that is required. In the meantime, we were re-booked on the following flight heading to Zanzibar with a scheduled departure at 00:15 a.m. Meant a total waiting time of 24+ hours. We were confident that everything would be alright with our re-booked flight cause the departure Terminals in the lounge didn´t tell any difference. When we arrived at our departure gate there was already a crowd of people screaming, causing and folding their hands over their heads in disbelief. FLIGHT CANCELLED!!!! (as we found out later for many of the passengers, not for the first time) We thought it couldn´t get any better until we heard one of the plenty of explanations that the grounded personal had to offer why the flight was actually cancelled. Due to her saying there is a strike at the moment and there was already a very high percentage that this flight could be cancelled. She continued that the possibility was known to them for two days. At this point, I would like to stop with my remarks. I hope I was able to express my feelings towards Kenya airways in an objective and helpful way for people who think about travelling with the airline. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it at all more so I would advise you to avoid it! To conclude my statements I want to add that mistakes can happen at all time and in any way. It is that time when a human being, company what so ever is tested to see if their status quo can stand the surroundings. Kenya Airways failed at all levels. They should go back the drawing boards and start from the bottom down so that their slogan \"pride of Africa\" can either be fulfilled with life or be just another slogan that is not worth the paper it's written on.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marco09091990","crvsd":"Marco P. wrote a review Mar 2019","ui_header_link":"Marco P.","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r657077524-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"\"Horror\"","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Locally we frequently fly Kenya Airways and I have always been very pleased with their service.  We tried this flight since the price point was better than others and the direct flight was appealing.  To me the ground service (check in, security) was outstanding and better than other carriers.  I did have to call about some ticket issues and reached a live person almost immediately on the phone.  However, I agree the in-flight service was suboptimal as they only pass by during meal times.  On our return flight they had cups of water and juice as well as some snacks in the back of the plane which was an improvement over the way there when I was begging for water for myself and my family repeatedly.  Also the food was better on the return flight (NBO--NYC), probably since it had been sourced in Kenya.  HOWEVER, the turbulence on the way back was simply terrifying.  Was it a bad day?  Is it always like that because of the route?  I do not like to consider what funeral plans my family might make for me while I am at 40,000 feet.  My spouse said that the turbulence alone was enough for us to pay the extra $$ for a different carrier.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reddy009","crvsd":"Reddy009 wrote a review Mar 2019","ui_header_link":"Reddy009","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r656744254-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Turburlence was scary - otherwise I was pleased","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This aircraft was used for my Nairobi to Johannesburg leg. So much better then almost 6h in a 737-800.\nSeat and space is great, such a pleasure actually versus the other flight. However if you look for frills, bells and whistles, not hear its functional, easy to use has plug point, USB point. The seat padding could be renewed as the seat covering material is dated. Otherwise great.\nWindow shades are per pushbutton and whilst the cabin was relatively new, it had not been cleaned properly from the previous le of this aircraft.\nThe service was so, so only 8 passenger in the business class section thus a boring leg for the crew and sitting in 1J made me listed to a lot and vocal conversation throughout the flight. See picture.\nDrinks were offered but sans the bow of nuts, the menu style as simple and straight forward as in my previous experience but the food was tasting that much better and the beef stew was brilliant.\nOtherwise an eventful flight and my take is that the business class of KQ is a no frill business class which makes a lot of sense to me reflecting in the price and if KQ would be using the same aircraft style on the Mumbai to Nairobi leg, I may say good bye to the middle eastern airline have relative comfort and safe quite a bit of money.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/d4/eb/5c/chris-p.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496ChrisP","crvsd":"Chris P wrote a review Feb 2019","ui_header_link":"Chris P","default":"Bengaluru, India","phmbo":"144 contributions","phmbo1":"66 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r652726654-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Pride of Africa","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The price for business class was most attractive so much so that I took into account that the longest leg of my Journey - Mumbai to Nairobi was in a 737-800 for 5h40.\nWhilst the check in was fast and efficient, there was not a person from Kenya Airways available, as I wanted to change my booking thus I was stuck.\nThe lounge facilities KQ is using in Mumbai is great and adequate.\nBoarding was done according to row and it took some time, via an airbridge with business class passengers boarding last.\nThe aircraft was newish too but the seats well sat in the leg rest simply unless as only coming up ½ way letting the legs hang in midair, so just no use.\nFriendly cabin crew dished out hot towels and pre take off drinks did not include Champagne or sparkling wine.\nAfter take off drinks service included a beautiful South African Red Wine, which I had together with a bowl of nuts.\nFood service was ½ way into the flight, the menu had choices all straight forward and simple not tasting as great as the food which I had from Nairobi to Johannesburg. No frills, if you are used to a substantial dinner, eat before the flight. The so called Waldorf salad had no celery in it, i.e. just apple and Walnut in a vegetarian Mayonnaise. Chicken was dry dessert OK rounded up with a great cup of Kenyan Tea.\nI did not use the entertainment system, but saw from other passengers that it was working well.\nIt was a bit stressful sitting in such a confined space for almost 6 hours.

Therefore we had to hire one at £6 per day for 21 days and replace it once back in the UK.\n\nThe response from Kenya Airways was awful. Slow response to my emails informing them of the issue initially but on our return to the UK they asked for all information regarding how much the sat nav cost etc. Digging this out was not a quick process. 4 weeks later I got a response saying that that no compensation was going to be paid, basically hiding behind terms and conditions.

However, for a 14 hours flight flying business you expect full comfort and that is not what I got.\nI understand that Kenya Airways has just started the route and has to use a smaller plane than other intercontinental flights (most of the seats were empty) which then translate in seats that do not extend to a flat bed nor one with enough room leg when laying down. It also shakes more when hitting turbulence than a bigger plane would and that is a big minus for an anxious flyer as I am.\nThe food and snacks were very average for that class of service and I thought that the movie selection was rather poor, with only very few recent movies to opt from...

However, here are some observations for future travelers to be prepared and some takeaways from a customer experience for the airline.The connection process returning to the US from other African cities via Nairobi needs work.  Due to their flight schedule I had a 50 min layover in Nairobi.  My departing flight from Kigali thankfully left on time however, the ticket agent could not print out a boarding pass for the Nairobi to NYC leg of the trip.  This meant after landing in Nairobi I, along with many other passengers had to wait in line and have a boarding pass printed.  This seemed like a unnecessary step creating more work for the airline and stress for the customer who already has a short connection time.  Add to that deplaning in Nairobi meant getting on a shuttlebus to the terminal, filling out a health form, passing through 2 levels of security and you start to get the picture.  We made the flight and the staff was helpful in getting everyone shuttled through their process but if you look at their on time departure record you will see the flight from Nairobi to JFK is always late.  You can see why...they are holding the flight for all the incoming transfers to go through their process which is longer and more stressful than needed.  Also this left no time for grabbing a snack or water for the 15 hour journey ahead. Also be sure to load up your ipad with movies.  The inflight options are not as extensive as other airlines and the choices are the same both eastbound and westbound.  For a 15 hour flight this needs improvement.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgtraveler2016","crvsd":"jgtraveler2016 wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"jgtraveler2016","default":"Boston, Massachusetts","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r647605191-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Still have kinks to work out on new NYC-Nairobi route","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Checking the kiosks along my route to the air trains for gate and other information, I encountered the following messages in this order.....1) my flight was cancelled 2) no longer cancelled but an hour behind 3) on time 4) boarding. (An hour and a half early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was told by the gentlemen I was seated between.)\nAs you can tell, it was difficult to understand what to do, so I began to run through the massive airport in case boarding was the last change being made. Unfortunately, after running so fast, the first thing I discovered was that everyone has vacated their posts due to the newest update. (Offering no explanation to those of us who were arriving on time) The guard did let me through since I already had a boarding pass, but after negotiating security at break neck speed I still had to go to the very last gate in this section of the airport. When I arrived, almost an hour ahead of when boarding was supposed to begin, the attendants would not even look at me until I forced them to, and refused to open door though the plane was clearly sitting there. After I convinced them to open the door they told me everything was fine, and they had my luggage. When I arrived in Entebbe, my luggage had been lost. This was a direct flight from jfk to entebbe. This tells me they did not take care of my luggage as they said. I cannot fathom a universe in which it would be legal, right, good, helpful, honest, or ok, for lack of a better way to describe it, in which people arrive on time to discover their pilot decided to leave early. What in the world? Moreover those poor people had been sitting in the plane that whole time so what good was boarding early in the first place????? It was a very close call and a terrible experience. They were not apologetic, helpful until forced to be, or nice. Once I boarded the plane, somehow I lost my window seat and was placed in the middle isle in the middle seat between two large men. They treated me as if I had been the offending party. Then on the next KA flight, out of Nairobi , one of the attendants hit me HARD on my arm when I was resting and yelled at me to lift my shade?!?!?!?!?!?! In what world can attendants hit you and yell at you to lift your shade? Why must our shades be up in the first place as we fly along in the sky??????No explanation. Sadly, this is the only flight of its kind, so I’m stuck using a more challenging route. Honestly, it will be worth it to go through Europe or Turkey not to experience that sort of situation again. I’m hopeful that better staffed and trained attendants will come on board and that Kenya Airways will take heed all of their bad reviews to heart. They could truly be so much more with such little effort.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HSBKU","crvsd":"HSBKU wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"HSBKU","default":"","phmbo":"3 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"New York City - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r646595056-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Departure","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On this flight no breakfast was served or Menus provided till i requested for before landing_ this isn't my Job, it should come automatically without a client having to ask for it. On arrival in Nairobi i proceeded straight for my Mombasa flight which was VIA Jambojet where i met a Rude & uncouth server. When i asked her if my luggage was on board her response was totally out of line how do you tell a client you can go fetch your bags from where you come from, at this point i was outraged as my flight was departing at 9:40, well i missed the flight as i had to go & fetch my bags, and so you are aware the Server wasn't remorseful at All, i reported this incident to the JKIA KQ Offices & Mombasa Office too on the 27th but for Sure it was never reported.\n\nMy flight was slated for the 4th of January back to Dubai, on the 3rd KQ confirmed my upgrade Status and & my Credit-card was charged, on the 4th of January i decided to take the 540 out of Mombasa instead of flying with KQ_ I wasn't going to go through another experience of having my bags left behind, upon reaching Nairobi an hour later i proceeded to check in for my business flight but since i had missed my Mombasa flight they couldn't see the booking, i understand that at this point they should have charged me for NO SHOW PENALTY But they proceeded to tell me that We are Sorry Mr.Mutava we cannot see your booking so please call your Travel agent? I couldn't believe what i was hearing, as in im in Kenya you need me to call my Travel agent who will take time to re-book me instead of you finding a solution right their, i asked to speak to a manager but no 1 seemed responsive to call 1. As this was escalating the lady at the KQ offices that morning told me that the only available option was to pay 980$ (Parting with this sum of money & you hadn't planned for is unfair) to fly on business, i already told her that have i a confirmed ticket why wouldn't she Penalize me for the NO show & let me proceed, no explanation was given, at this point i was tired & needed to get on my flight & come see my Family, on the flight back to Dubai 1 of the flight Attendants on Business was Francis,his attention to detail and most of all his smile was utterly impeccable, he oozed of proper etiquette & Customer Care know how, you Francis are a Star & we need more like you, so yes not all was bad i will give credit where its due.\n\nI am not looking for freebies but you have to understand that the Slogan you bear carries Weight as you are a National Airline & to receive Such services its uncalled for, if your Staff cannot handle the pressure Of the Airline Sector then you will loose numbers with time. For Sure you have lost me as a client, i may be just 1 person but revenue is revenue & it keeps you running it doesn't matter which Cabin i flew what matters is that you hold your end of the bargain and get me the right Services.

The only benefit I see is the big window. I dont know if KQ went for the cheapest upholstery available but I find the seats the most uncomfortable I have ever flown. What is all the hype about? Have KQ let us down?\n\nWithin an hour my back is aching and I have nowhere to put my legs and, God forbid, if the passenger in front reclines his seat, you find you are headbutting the TV screen every time you want to eat the food they serve.\n\n8th January 2019 was auspicious, i guess for all the wrong reasons. We boarded on time and closed the doors, 100% full, on time. But then Traffic Control advised of the drone at Heathrow which had caused the runway to be closed and delayed our departure. Not KQ's fault by any means and neither was the update of information. We finally departed, with an already aching back, 90 minutes later and arrived in NBO about 45 minutes later having been served a very average dinner of bean salad, spicy chicken and boiled rice and cheesecake for dinner and a truly awful box of croissant and coco chip cookie for breakfast that tasted about one week old.\n\nService on KQ these days has become very variable ranging from amazingly good to amazingly bad, often at the whim of the flight crews and, more often than not, its the female crew members who seems to be the least helpful. But not always. On this flight, just one of the ladies seemed to wish she was someplace else (so did we) but the remainder provided an average to well above average level of service.\n\nNairobi ground crews were helpful, especially at 6am when JKIA is bursting at the seams on a daily basis. One of our onward flights was cancelled but a slightly later flight had the reservation already confirmed. Kigali flight boarded early and left 10 minutes early, was served a single slightly fresher croissant for breakfast by very friendly flight crews and arrived in good time.\n\nAs always, Kigali ground crews were efficient and friendly.\n\nSo would I fly KQ again? I am not really sure. Short haul for sure but long haul has so many alternative options that have more comfortable seats, better food and better service that the decision needs careful consideration. I will let you know.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanzantraveller","crvsd":"tanzantraveller wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"tanzantraveller","default":"Kigali, Rwanda","phmbo":"66 contributions","phmbo1":"36 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r644928164-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The KQ Dreamliner is not so dreamy","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

But my experience with Kenya Airways was just so disappointing that I have to write a review.\n\nI was set to fly from Cape Town Intl. At 23.00 on 21 December to Amsterdam via Nairobi, with a 2h20min layover. So...\n\n(1) KA continuously emails you suggesting you upgrade your seat to business class but can't email you to let you know that your flight has been delayed. I only found out because I decided to Google, as KA already seemed to have a bad reputation and I wanted to make sure.\n\n(2) arrived at the airport on time, none of the staff could give me any information about the flight or whether I would actually make my connecting flight. The first flight was delayed 2 hours to 1AM with boarding staring at 00.20. While waiting I decided to do some googling. Turns out the reason our flight was delayed was because the incoming flight from Nairobi had been delayed. This flight was meant to land in Cape Town at 00.45. So tell me, how are we supposed to board at 00.20 when the other flight is only landing 25 min later? Eventually they updated the departure to 1.30am. We only left at 2am. I understand that flights get delayed, but what irritated the hell out of me was that I watched them vacuum the plane for at least 20min while we were waiting to board. I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't care about a slightly dirty plane if it means getting to your destination on time.\n\n(3) when we boarded the plane I asked the flight attendants about my connecting flight. They too could not give me any information. I asked whether the pilots would be able to keep us informed. No. No help at all. No information. Nothing. We would have to wait til we land in Nairobi. It being 2am I went straight to sleep and skipped the meal. When I woke up around 5 or 6 I was pretty hungry so I called an attendant and asked if I could please have a snack, like a packet of nuts or something. \"we've already served the meals\" she said rudely. \"I know, I just want like a packet of nuts or something\". Off she went in a huff. Like geez, it's just a packet of nuts.\n\n(4) we landed in Nairobi at 8am, I saw my connecting flight being pushed out as we were coming in. I'm not sure why they didn't hold the flight. Getting off, it became apparent that there were around 40 of us who had missed the flight. So instead of trying to get us on the flight they ended up sending us all to a hotel for the day to wait for the next flight, at midnight. The hotel was nice and everything but I had already made a nonrefundable booking for a hotel in Amsterdam, which I obviously lost out on.\n\n(5) finally arrived in Amsterdam 36 hours later, only to find that the airline had left one of my bags in Nairobi and the other one was beaten to a pulp.\n\nI honestly will never fly with Kenya Airways again and will definitely not recommend it. It was just a completely horrendous experience.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanhaupt91","crvsd":"Meghan H wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"Meghan H","default":"Hermanus, South Africa","phmbo":"4 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Amsterdam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r644693685-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya Airways, not the pride of Africa.","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Our Dec 19th original flight was changed by Kenya which resulted in a 5 yr layover from a 2 hour layover.  When we arrived we learned the connecting flight had issues so our layover was now 9 hours.  Prior to my departure I emailed Kenya explaining the long layover created by them and requested complimentary lounge passes for me & my guest - which was approved.  Upon arriving at the Kenya lounge in Nairobi we were asked to wait while the ladies at reception seeked information on this request.  I had the actually email in my hand giving approval, yet they didn't care what it said..  They made us wait for over an hour in the lobby, only to come back and say that Customer Service Rep I corresponded with never completed the transaction by requesting management approval from that location, therefor we needed to leave or pay the $45 fee to stay.  We ended up paying out of frustration but voiced our negative experience.  The employees at the lounge could care less and were rude.We not only experienced rudeness in the lounge but also on the entire flight to and from Africa on top of this discrimination.  It was very clear that the employees are not fans of white people, doesn't matter where you are from.  Pressing the button on the flight for service went unanswered, yet they clearly saw the button as eye contact with the light by flight attendant was made (we have video of this).  We had to physically reach out of the aisle to ask for water from flight attendant.  Then it was given with an attitude, for disturbing them.  I wrote Kenya Air again of my negative experience and was given an apology and a credit voucher for a future flight.  I will never use this voucher as I never plan on flying them again.  I'm a world traveler and fly a ridiculous amount of miles.  This is hands down the worst airline and experience I have ever come across.

My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding.\n\nAfter a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to the States with Kenya Airways. The attendant there helpfully let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, given my presence in Zimbabwe, and would very much like to return home, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, which typically include a flight home, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded ransom payments to let me out of the sweltering hot airport onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes.\n\n16 hours later, having missed every single flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 “penalty,” or really, the ransom payment, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. At this point I had resigned myself to the fact I had probably died and was in some new circle of airline hell, but fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice.

The entire online booking experience was promising and the ticket fares appeared to be competitive. I received numerous e-mails following the booking offering opportunities to upgrade to Business Class. Our routing was from Johannesburg to Nairobi on KQ763 (a short 4 hour flight on a Boeing 737-800) and then a short 90-minute layover at Jomo Kenyatta Airport before connecting to flight KQ886 which would take us to Bangkok. When checking in online the night before our flight, I experienced difficulty with the website which claimed that there was a \"system error\" making it impossible to complete the online check-in (even though I had completed all passport and other details for the two passengers travelling). I contacted the local office in Morningside, Sandton to be told that we could only check-in at OR Tambo Airport and should get there 3 hours before the flight. Later the same day, I received a SMS from the airline informing us of a 7,5 hour delay for flight KQ886 for \"technical/operational reasons\". On landing in Nairobi, I approached the airline desk to be told that we would be taken to a hotel close by and brought back in the morning to catch our flight to Bangkok. It was clear that there were many other passengers in the same situation as well as those who had missed connections due to late arrivals. After waiting for three hours in the airport we boarded a bus and drove for approximately 30 minutes to the hotel. They were not prepared for our arrival at all and chaos ensued. The meal that had been promised was not ready and it took another 45 minutes to get room access. It was 2:00am before we got to our room and we were told to be in the lobby at 4:00am for the return to the airport. At 4:00am there was no transport in sight. Fearful of missing our flight, we decided to hail an Uber taxi at 5:00am in order to get back to the airport. This fiasco led to us missing our domestic flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui, we missed one night of accommodation at our resort and also our pre-paid airport shuttles that were to take us to our destinations. This incompetence is such a pity considering that, once in the air, the flights are not bad at all. Service is friendly and efficient, the aircraft are clean and new (Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a great aeroplane) and the meals, whilst a bit small, are not bad at all.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11Globetrotter11","crvsd":"11Globetrotter11 wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"11Globetrotter11","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"48 contributions","phmbo1":"25 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Bangkok","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r644188559-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Such a wasted opportunity","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Kenya Airways are not low-cost, and for regular working people, these flights are a substantial chunk of our savings. We work hard for this money and then spend it in good faith hoping that our hard work will be reciprocated with good service, newer airplanes, decent food, and on-time departures and arrivals. After all, we schedule vacations around what is possible with our jobs and kids’ school schedules. Kenya Airways who boast being “the Pride of Africa” are only missing the point. The point is this “good faith” must start at the top and trickle down. If there’s no real leadership at the top, the employees down the hierarchy will have no incentive, accountability, or feeling of ownership when it comes to providing a certain level of service. A smiling face of a CEO dressed in expensive clothes and watch is just missing the point. If you only cater to business/first travelers and forget about the majority economy travelers, you are missing the point. The feeling I got flying Kenya Airways for the first and last time is that it’s missing a certain culture which is so important for customer loyalty. The point is that if a plane is 15 years old and unpleasant, especially the toilets, but the service and timeliness of flights is on a high level, one does not notice the equipment. Our trip from Cape Town to Bangkok and back was the worst I’ve ever taken with any airline. Everything was matter of fact. Except for the last leg from Nairobi to Cape Town through Victoria Falls (which was still the wrong return flight and 24 hours too late) ALL flights were delayed between two and twelve hours. The on-board meals are half the size of comparable flights and mostly junk. Drinks cart selection looks like Aeroflot in the 80’s. Kenyans are warm and inviting. Is there a reason why that cannot be the same at Kenyatta airport? Is Kenya Airways not the major airline of that airport? When there’s no culture at the top, there’s no culture on the ground. Rude immigration officers and security personnel throwing bins at passengers. And everything done at snail pace, with total disregard and matter of fact. There are many wonderful and accommodating employees along the way, but that is not the point. We all tend to remember the negative and unpleasant, but the right kind of culture has no room for negative. Customers have choice, and if enough customers stop using Kenya Airways, will that make its point? ANY paying customer must not only receive the same high level of treatment the CEO would receive, even if our cutlery differs, but return home praising the little things. That IS the point.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/f9/8a/16/danielct1.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielCT1","crvsd":"Around the world Daniel wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"Around the world Daniel","default":"New York City, New York","phmbo":"10 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r643724523-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Not The Pride of Africa","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The next available flight was 6 hours later, I was irate and demanded that they at the least offer me access to their lounge in Nairobi where I could rest before my next flight. I left the counter after being promised that I would be taken care of in Nairobi and that I would receive my bags there, where I would then check them back in since I was worried they would be misplaced (not unheard of considering their reputation).\n\n6 hours later I arrived at Nairobi airport shortly after 1am, navigated my way through airport security and immigration (East African Citizen so that wasnt much of a problem), only to find another surprise awaiting me, the Kenya airways desk was empty! security staff informed me that no one would be coming until after 4AM. Dejected, I sat at the empty airport for the next 3 hours until someone finally showed up. In the end all i got was a meal voucher for breakfast at a dirty, smelly, greasy spoon restaurant. The Kenya airways staff were rude and totally rejected my request for access to their lounge, citing that 6 hours is really not too much waiting time and I shouldnt expect anything from them. 6 hours of my time wasted due to their incompetence and they have the nerve to tell me that I should not expect anything from them?!\n\nAll in all, the worst experience ever! and ive flown Jetblue!

I'm so impressed with how this airline has made such an effort to deliver. We flew as a family of 8 from India, stopped over in Nairobi and had a connecting flight to Johannesburg. During the first flight, a young woman was sick and the crew asked for medical help. My fiance, who is a doctor volunteered. They then moved us( the 2 of us) to business class. The flight attendant Evelyn even took the recommendations about updating their first aid kit. She was such a pleasure. During that flight I left my travelling pillow on board. When we caught our next flight back to Johannesburg, one of the air hostesses handed me my pillow. I was so surprised. I have flown with Emirates and other such airlines. Kenya airlines really deserves a thumbs up for the effort that they are making in becoming Africa's best airline. I'm sure in the near future they will also upgrade the airport.

I have to share my experience to warn other travellers to please beware and avoid!! We recently flew to Tanzania with them, via Kenya, Nairobi. Our plane from Douala so delayed (situation normal for any KA flights...every single flight is delayed..) we arrived in Nairobi so late, but would have managed to catch our connection to Tanzania by the skin of our teeth...however, the pilot of our connecting flight decided to leave early, LEAVE EARLY when he knew there were passengers connecting from another KA flight.....and guess what ?This was the last flight of the day!! So we had to over night in Kenya - in the airport - no bags, clean clothes etc etc ..and wait for the 9am flight the next morning. So we missed the first night in our luxury safari lodge. Next day flew to Tanzanian, oh the airplane staff decided the flight was too heavy , so took ours - and loads of other passengers - luggage off...we arrived in Tanzania with no luggage. Again, this is situation normal for this shambles of an airline... How can an airline sell you a ticket which includes luggage allowance - then decide they will just take it off, no warning, no asking would you mind, they just do it ?! So it was 48 hrs until we saw our bags again...!\nComing home from Tanzania...same old story...flight delayed 3 hours...got back into Doula, no luggage AGAIN...we were told, sorry they took luggage off the plane as it as so heavy...\n4 days later, after numerous calls and emails, our luggage arrived at Douala, damaged, battered and broken. I was told I was lucky to get my luggage as its christmas time and the flights are full.\nHow the hell can you arrange to go on holiday with an airline that wont deliver your luggage for you to enjoy your holiday? The luggage allowance you have paid for with your ticket.\nI warn you, book with them at your peril, but you will regret it !!! This is absolutely situation normal for them. Ive been travelling the world for 30 years, and never ever ever have I come across such a shambles of an airline. They call themselves the pride of africa....the JOKE of africa is more apt. Whoever is running this joke of a company needs to be sacked !!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/1c/ad/86/clare-m.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D7194CHclarem","crvsd":"clare m wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"clare m","default":"Namibia","phmbo":"20 contributions","phmbo1":"20 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Douala - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r640725596-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Worst airline on the planet.

We could carry even 28 kgs in a bag & had to pay extra weight for additional 5kgs only. But in our recent experience, everything had changed. Each bag should not be more than 23 kgs. Over & above 23kgs need a separate bag even if it is 4 kgs more. For this separate bag, Kenya airways charges were not per kgs but US $200 per bag irrespective of weight. So travellers are compelled to carry a separate bag & pay US $ 200 for it, whether it's 2kgs, 3kgs up to 23 kgs. It's a way of money making policy. Charge only for extra kilos of weight & not US $ 200 flat rate for any excess kilo of weight.\n\n2- Food during flight- They have REDUCED the quantity of meals provided during flight.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiRaj92","crvsd":"NiRaj92 wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"NiRaj92","default":"Mumbai, India","phmbo":"879 contributions","phmbo1":"14 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r640622997-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Changed policy for extra weight & food","tehyy":"","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

If a flight is just going from point to point this is a fabulous flight. If a flight is an opportunity for an experience of any nature then there's not much about this flight that stands out. I should point out that the flight from Nairobi to New York, as the New York to Nairobi flight, was just about half or less than half empty. I had 3 seats to myself both ways so for me those flights were very comfortable but you can't depend on that. Shortly after takeoff from Nairobi we got a very meager dinner, arguably the least impressive of all the dinners I've ever had on comparable flights in economy. No one expects great wine in economy but the red wine I had on this flight was at the low end of that already low range. On the outbound flight I had a couple of packages of macadamia nuts, a VERY impressive and delicious improvement over the tiny bags of peanuts you get on a Delta flight. But on the return flight there were no nuts at all (I was looking forward to them). The movie/TV selection was good enough but not exceptional. The breakfast was  better than the dinner the night before so that slightly redeemed the meal aspect of the flight. The flight crew was very friendly and accommodating but how much can they do for you in economy? It was really a great flight, but only because I had 3 seats to be able to lie down and sleep comfortably. I would still opt again for this flight just because it's so much more convenient than connecting through any other airport.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/b9/ef/f7/nigerdave.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nigerdave","crvsd":"Nigerdave wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"Nigerdave","default":"Cazenovia, New York","phmbo":"240 contributions","phmbo1":"78 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - New York City","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r639610294-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The newly inaugurated KQ flight from New York to Nairobi is a great convenience","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The service agent insisted on a $300 fee and refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor. Filing a complaint with the corporate office yielded an equally unhelpful response. The change would have incurred no inconvenience or loss of revenue to the airline, but their insistence on enforcing this absurd change fee reflects the fact that they are a mercenary airline, whose only interest is squeezing the customer for their money.

We were supposed to have a 1-hour stop-over on our way to a much anticipated and relaxing holiday at Zanzibar. But then this happened...\n\nWe got onto our connecting flight on time. After driving to the point where we should’ve taken off, the pilot announced that there were some technical difficulties that should be checked. So we drove back to the ‘parking spot’. And there we sat. In a closed airplane. For at least an hour.\n\nI should also probably say that this was an early morning flight, so we would’ve gotten breakfast. But alas, no.\n\nAfter an hour in the plane we were asked to get off as it was not safe to fly.\n\nThen we followed a guy to the domestic flights desk and there we were for another 2 hours (without any food in the vacinity) just trying to get a new flight ASAP. It took exactly 1,5hours for the manager to show up, and after a lot of fighting we heard that we could get a flight later that evening.\n\nSo, we got a flight - yeah! On the same day that we paid for - yeah! And we got 4 hours in a hotel to freshen up plus lunch - yeah!\n\nHowever, I’m still quite angry. I missed my first day of my 7 days in Zanzibar (I know I sound so spoiled). But, hey, they say time is money. And this time was not worth the money.\n\nThink twice before you choose Kenya Airways as a stop-over on your way to a nice idyllic holiday. It might just make you more stressed out than you were before.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/b2/d3/86/marike-s.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarikeSpang","crvsd":"MarikeSpang wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"MarikeSpang","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r639087882-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya Airways ruined the beginning of a much needed holiday in Zanzibar!","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At check in i asked if a wheelchair had been arranged at Nairobi and for our connecting flight to Mombasa as was told yes, not so in reality. Had pre booked a right aisle seat to allow my daughter to stretch her right leg out but when on the plane found they had given us a middle and left aisle seat so ended up asking to swap seats with another traveller.\n\nWas told by check in that our luggage would go straight to Mombasa so no need to collect it at Nairobi. Incorrect information and it was only due to the fact that the person who was pushing the wheelchair (when they eventually got us one) saying we needed to collect it we would have left it at Nairobi airport. That would have meant we'd have been without our luggage for the first couple of days of our holiday.\n\nThat said it was reasonably priced and got us to our destination. The cabin staff were good it was the check in staff that let them down. When checking in at Mombasa for our return flight the check in lady was extremely rude and wanted to know why my daughter was in the wheelchair. Considering she was in a full leg brace I'd have said it was obviously needed. They need to have a little more consideration for disabled travellers and just because my daughter is young does not mean she doesn't require assistance.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483mandyr","crvsd":"mandy r wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"mandy r","default":"Gloucester, United Kingdom","phmbo":"39 contributions","phmbo1":"25 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Mombasa","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r638669740-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Special Assistance was erratic","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Kenya airways cancelled the first flight, didn't tell me & rebooked me on a later plane - which arrived at Nairobi 3 hours after the onward flight had already left there! How stupid was that?!\n\nBuy merest chance I discovered this mistake a week before the journey, and managed to change the first flight to an early one which meant leaving the hotel at 3 a.m.\nMeaning this simple journey would now take about 16 hours of travelling including a massive stopover in Nairobi. NOT great for 65yr olds.\n\nHad I not discovered the cancellation in time, we would not have reached Seychelles that day. We could not have stopped overnight in Nairobi as we had no multi-entry visa.\nWe would have lost hundreds in hotels and booked onwards arrangements.\nIt turns out that first flight is cancelled regularly - typically 1 day each week.\n\nDid Kenya Airways care or try to do anything for us? Not a thing.\nI asked Kenya airways if, given it was their mistake, we could have access to rest in the Nairobi business Lounge or even get an upgrade to business (only 4 seats in business had been sold on that flight so lots and lots of room)\n\nNo, nothing said the agent.\nFill in our customer form said Facebook.\nZero response from customer services, then or since\nUtter waste of time.\n\nIn the event we paid to upgrade to business. What a waste of money! The Business Lounge was tiny and poor. Meals in business class were worse than in most Airlines economy. Oh and the plane from Nairobi took off and arrived late (for no good reason) making the day even longer.\n\nAnd guess what: I got an email inviting me to check in for the flight - that had been cancelled.\n\nKenya Airways are lucky they have a captive market of Kenyans, because I can't see any European ever flying with them more than once!\n\nYou have been warned.

There is no option for economy comfort (the plane was a 3-3-3 configuration) so this long haul flight is either economy or business. We had preselected our seats when we purchased our tickets but had been reseated apart from each other when we checked in (no reason given). The plane was HOT and crowded and the seats cramped and uncomfortable which made the possibility of sleep almost nil (departed at 20:50). After the meal service, the lights were dimmed. Due to the policy of free unlimited alcohol, however, this did not mean that people were quiet. There were a few loud drunks on board who had delightfully chosen not to sit next to each other and were shouting across rows. The cabin crew, perhaps understandably, did nothing to quiet these people, but did bring them more alcohol any time they requested it. I was not seated next to them, but was still kept awake by their endless ranting. Arriving in Nairobi I felt rattled, groggy, and, frankly gross, because the temperature had been uncomfortably high (felt like at least 25C). This was a leisure trip and definitely started my holiday off in a negative mood.\nAfter talking with other people, it appears that drunken disorderly passengers are not uncommon on Kenya Airways and they would be my last choice if other options are available.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogarobin","crvsd":"yogarobin wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"yogarobin","default":"Delft, The Netherlands","phmbo":"159 contributions","phmbo1":"97 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r635241213-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Uncomfortable and loud","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When they came to serve refreshments which i was looking forward to. They served a cheap vodka which tasted awful had no Gin and the selection of alcohol was very little to say the least. You either had Vodka, Whisky or Rum that was it. All of them weren't premium brands and to be honest i never heard of the brand they were serving. I had one drink my wife had no choice but to drink a juice and she does not drink the options offered. On a 6 hour flight they only came round once and to be honest the taste was so awful that I don't think anyone would have had a second drink.

My flight up to Nairobi which I upgraded for my wife & me to Business Class was very good.\n\nHowever when it came to the time to return I once again checked online, saw the scheduled aircraft was the Dreamliner, and once again upgraded three seats, mine, my wife’s and my nephew’s, who’d worked the Mara season with us and I thought I’d give him a little reward.\n\nHowever on arrival at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport the morning of our flight, September 29, there was great confusion and consternation until they admitted we’d been downgraded back to Economy...despite the fact I could show proof that my upgrades had been approved and my Visa card debited.\n\nThe airline ground crew were very apologetic and it appeared that there may have been some important politicians wanting to fly that morning, as well as the fact that the aircraft was downscaled to an old 737.\n\nFortunately we did manage to get our check in luggage accepted at the Business Class allowance (Note: Kenya Airways allows Economy passengers only half the allowance that SAA allows. This is an important consideration when going on a long safari. Kenya Airways gives you 1x23kg, SAA 2x23).\n\nLater, once already seated on board, the aircraft cabin staff approached my wife and me and offered us seats (not together) up front in Business Class but left our nephew in Economy. So much for the kid’s big treat.\n\nWe were told by the cabin attendant to apply for a refund once we got back to South Africa, though they did not have the forms they should have given us for this application.\n\nHahahaha!\n\nKenyaAirways have given me the total runaround over this ever since. I have sent them copies of tickets, boarding passes, the letter of approval for the upgrade saying my Visa card would be debited and still I wait.\n\nEvery time I contact them I get redirected to a website to fill in and supply the exact same details all over again.\n\nNow seven weeks later I think I have to give up...and I will certainly NOT use Kenya Airways again. I will also warn my guests against this airline as customer service and satisfaction seems to be very low on their agenda. You have been warned!\n\nDon’t Fly Kenya Airways","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/32/6b/66/daryl-b.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarylB532","crvsd":"Daryl B wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"Daryl B","default":"","phmbo":"11 contributions","phmbo1":"13 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r633945642-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Never Again - they stole my money","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Initially we had direct flights from Entebbe to Abu Dhabi through Etihad, however I think due to it being down season, they changed the leg to include Kenya Airways flight from Entebbe to Nairobi.\n\nThat morning before we left for the airport we had no emails to suggest any flight changes. It was only when we got to the airport did we find out, the flight had been cancelled. No explanation was given and the ground staff appeared to also be in the dark with what had happened. We got to the airport early, and service tried to get us on the earlier flight, however we were not able to get on, as only 1 of us could get a ticket before the ticketing system crashed. They managed to get us on the subsidiary budget airline Jambojet. It was 30 minutes late, meaning we had less than 40 minutes to connect onto our next flight. This required us to run flat out to the boarding gate in Nairobi. Fortunately we got there and Etihad's staff were able to sort us onto the next two flights and even take opportunities to make our next two flights more pleasant.\n\nOur experience has made us unlikely to even flight Kenya Airways. Whilst it is appreciated the Entebbe staff were able to get us one another flight, had we been on time for our flight, rather then quite early, there is no way we would have been assisted in time to have made the Jambojet flight, as there were at least 100 people displaced due to the flight cancellation and we wouldn't have gotten home for at least another day.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Courtz47","crvsd":"Courtz47 wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"Courtz47","default":"Brisbane, Australia","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Entebbe - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r631806452-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Cancelled Kenya Airways Flight","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

One of the two pieces arrived in Kilimanjaro while the other got left behind in Nairobi (night of Sept 07/08).\n\nThe loss of one piece of baggage was recorded by Swissport, the baggage handling agent in Kilimanjaro, with a promise that it will arrive in a later flight from Nairobi and be delivered at our hotel in Arusha (Mount Meru Hotel)\n\nAfter several phone calls to Kenya Airways Central Contact Centre and constant follow-up throughout the day with the Swissport agent in Kilimanjaro, we were told at 7 pm on 08 Sept 2018 that the baggage has arrived but we have to go over to Kilimanjaro Airport to collect it, The airport is about 50 Kms away and we were to leave by a very early flight the next morning (09 Sept 2018) from a small airport in Arusha to a safari camp in the interior of Tanzania. It was going to be very inconvenient and taxing at that time of the night to travel a total of 100 kms to get back our baggage.\n\nIn the first place, the airlines goofed up by delivering only one piece of baggage and leaving the other midway, which is a great inconvenience as all my clothes were in the lost piece. Secondly, asking us to go over 50 Kms to collect the retrieved baggage was cruel (Kenya Airways should take this up with their agent, Swissport). It was extremely annoying to handle the guy on duty at Swissport on the night of 08 Sept 2018. So, we requested the Duty Manager at Hotel Mount Meru, Arusha to help us, which he willingly did. He took it upon himself, though it was not in his line of duty. He went out of his way to uphold the pride of Tanzania as a tourist destination. He was very clear in his mind that the guy at Swissport, Kilimanjaro Airport, was duty-bound to deliver lost baggage to our hotel and eventually ensured that it was done. I have written about this not-so-common show of initiative by a Duty Manager at a hotel in my review of our stay in Hotel Mount Meru, Arusha on 08/09 Sept 2018.\n\nKenya Airways would have to (1) take it up strongly with Swissport to ensure that its employees adhere to contract terms (that would have been entered into between themselves) and (2) put in place fail-safe practices at Nairobi airport, to ensure that piece-meal loading is avoided (either both pieces of baggage arrive or both pieces are lost, you can't have a little bit of each, that too at a major hub, Nairobi, the headquarters of Kenya Airways). It has been my habit to always check with the airline's agent at a transit point (when boarding) whether the baggage has been transferred. To my utter disappointment, the agent at Nairobi looked into the computer and confirmed to me that the two pieces were indeed loaded. This was obviously a big bluff.\n\nThe intention of this feedback is to ensure that Kenya Airways takes note of these lapses and provides better service in future.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BussaBangalore_India","crvsd":"BussaBangalore_India wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"BussaBangalore_India","default":"Bangalore,India","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r631522917-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya Airways' Agent,Swissport reluctant to deliver Lost Baggage at our Hotel in Aursha (50 Kms from Kilimajaro Airport)","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

TIA.\n\nSeats were rather squished, especially when the person in front of you leans their seat back.\n\nIn flight entertainment is limited to 100 movies across all languages.\n\nIn flight meal service was extremely slow, leaving you sitting with your finished meal tray long after you have eaten it. And there is not much on the meal tray. After the meal service, you won't see or here from the cabin crew except for when they are doing the duty free service. If you want some water, you'll have to go to the back of the plane for it yourself.\n\nToilets were not kept stocked with supplies throughout the flight, and I had to repeatedly put the toilet roll back on the holder.\n\nOn the way to Kenya we had a connecting flight at Nairobi for Mombasa an hour and a half later. Our luggage being clearly marked \"short transfer\" must be to indicate to the baggage handlers to leave this luggage until last, as everyone with a short transfer to Mombasa ended up waiting the best part of an hour in Nairobi to collect their baggage. After collecting it, we then had to rush to take it to be screened in Terminal 1A and across the airport courtyard (across unlevel surfaces with no straight route between the terminals) to be screened again at Terminal 1D. TIA.\n\nApart from the luggage and transfer experience, passable overall by my standards. Would put up with it again if going back to Kenya given the only other option for direct flights is BA.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoodle","crvsd":"Zoodle wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"Zoodle","default":"London","phmbo":"50 contributions","phmbo1":"75 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Mombasa","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r631294828-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Passable, but TIA","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Check in was smooth. Although they couldn’t give me my boarding pass for the second leg of my journey!\n\nKenya Airlines utilize the Bidvest Premier Lounge at O.R Tambo. Which is decent. Quite busy. But not chic. The newer SLOW lounge shared by the other SkyTeam airlines is way cooler and has a much better selection of drinks and food.\n\nThe flight to Nairobi was delayed by an hour (but we made up the time en route) with an on time landing!\n\nBoarding was a little chaotic. Better signage would help.\n\nOn board the hard product is great! The Dreamliner has a 2-2-2 configuration. And has three rows in one cabin, separated by the boarding doors and galley and then two rows in a second, directly in front of economy.\n\nI was fortunate to be in 2D. Middle row in the front cabin for both legs of the journey! I need to point out that there are no overhead bins available for rows 1 and 2 center seats. But saying that there was plenty of available space on both flights.\n\nThis seat is one of my favorites, plenty of space. It’s a lay flat. And is super comfy and wide. I would take this seat, with the risk of people sitting next to me or climbing over me. Over some of the smaller, cramped all aisle access seats that are out there. (Think Delta One 767!)\n\nI slept a solid 8 hours on my second flight!! And close to two hours on my first!\n\nThe service on board was actually quite good. The FA team take huge pride in what they do and they are genuinely honored to do the work they do. Personal standards are on point. Think Emirates!!\n\nThe food was actually really great! On my first flight I had the beef Babotie - which was AWESOME. (The food on both flights was really good!)\n\nOn my second flight I had the vegetarian option - the giant gnocchi, which was nice. For the mid-flight snack I had the pizza slice. (Although I think the burger may have been a better choice). And for the huge breakfast I had the fluffy omelet with chicken sausage. Included in breakfast is a fruit selection, yogurt, cereal and muffin. One of the biggest breakfasts I’ve ever had on a plane and only beaten by Emirates 1st Class.\n\nA decent selection of beverages is offered as well. The only downside is there is quite a delay before being served the first beverage after take off!\n\nThey don’t use duvets on board, and have opted for blankets instead. At first I was not a fan. But actually these are quite nice. The pillows, however, are quite flat. I snagged a second one on my first flight which made a big difference! Not so lucky on the second flight as Business was 100% full!\n\nThe IFE system is great and has a decent selection of movies, TV and Audio options (including audio books).\n\nDeplaning in Nairobi was seemless. Security was pretty smooth as well. The only drag is that I was not able to get my boarding pass until much later. After being directed to the transit desk.\n\nI knew I was going to be in Nairobi for a long layover and checked into the brand new Four Point Sheraton - which is fabulous. Going though passport control can be quite a process. And took longer than anticipated.\n\nHint - the taxis are quite a scene and the drivers are super aggressive. Even this 6’2 hardened New Yorker felt a little apprehensive. If you’re staying at any of the airport hotels. Email in advance and have their courtesy car pick you up. Learn from my mistake!\n\nCheck in, passport control and security at Niarobi was once again smooth. The lounge is small and despite being new looks quite shabby. But then again, some of the travelers using it have little respect for it either. Which is quite sad.\n\nBe prepared for a quite intense second security screening before boarding flights for the USA!\n\nAnd the boarding process was a bit of a mess with almost everyone rushing to board at the same time. Kenya Airways will have to address this! I had maneuvered myself near the front, so was one of the first to board!\n\nOverall - Kenya Airways offers a really good hard product, great service and food and beverage choices. They will need to address the boarding process and a look at how they manage the lounge in Nairobi. I paid a little over $2000 for a round trip Business Class ticket from JHB to JFK. (I think as part of their inaugural promotions) Which is a really great bargain. Saying that. If the price gets closer to the completion. I may select to stick with KLM or Virgin Atlantic.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KesterCB","crvsd":"KesterCB wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"KesterCB","default":"","phmbo":"279 contributions","phmbo1":"43 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - New York City","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r630835954-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya Airlines - solid business class at great value!","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My husband and I are on our honeymoon and flew Kenya Airways from Zambia to Nairobi and then Nairobi to the Seychelles. The airline kept sending us emails to upgrade to business, so we thought it would be fine and upgraded. From the moment we attempted to check in in Lusaka, this was an issue. The counter claimed we owed money, even though we showed them the email confirmation and bank payment. They left our bags unattended and made us go through security again, took our passports, and seemed like they were just trying to make us pay a second time for our tickets. They couldn’t figure it out after 2 hours and we almost missed our flight before they put us on the plane and agreed to have us “sort it out” for our next flight. We tried to resolve the issue when we landed in Nairobi and were directed to ticketing when they couldn’t solve it, again. Ticketing said everything was fine and to arrive at 9:10am the next day (it was nearly midnight at this point) for our 11:10am flight. In the morning, the counter had the same issue, not seeing our upgraded reservation. They finally figured it out and handed us tickets departing two hours later. When we asked when the flight had changed and why we hadn’t been informed, they shrugged. We were exhausted from travel and needed the extra sleep, but there was zero communication about the departure time change- funny, because all we’d gotten leading up to the flight was offers to upgrade. When we went to customer service, they were rude, incompetent, and actively unhelpful. They suggested we enjoy the lounge. We asked repeatedly to refund the upgrade and why we hadn’t been informed of the delay (they claimed the flight time had changed weeks ago!), and they literally laughed. It’s a dysfunctional, corrupt airline, and it should be put out of businesses. No one should ever fly this.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/95/avatar.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5653NSsarahm","crvsd":"Sarah T wrote a review Nov 2018","ui_header_link":"Sarah T","default":"Los Angeles, California","phmbo":"4 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Victoria","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r630407143-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Mrs.","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

To make it short I had a flight from Brazzaville to Paris sunday the 26th of august and there was two stops, one at Pointe Noire and the other at Nairobi. We were supposed to arrived monday the 27th at night time. But the company put all the passengers from Brazzaville and Pointe Noire on the same plane so it was overbooked... Not a single person from Brazzaville took the flight. We had to wait more than 36 hours before getting a new flight. This time it was Brazzaville-Nairobi-Dubaï-Paris... Everyone was annoyed but this is the best we could get with this INCOMPETENT company. During the stops we had no idea in which hotel we were supposed to sleep. They simply told us we would get one. We had to look alone through the WHOLE aiports ourselves, get a Visa in Nairobi because the hotel was outside of the aiport. We weren't even warned, fortunetly it was free because it was just a night. In Dubaï we slept in the hotel of the airport but it was so huge it also was really sporty to find it. There were children with us, parents with BARELY any food, diapers etc... left and they didn't care. Then we arrived in Paris but it wasn't the final destination for my family. My brother needed to go to Brussels, and the rest of us to Nantes. They PROMISED us they would pay the trains in Brazzaville. In Nairobi they said what happened to us was a RECCURENT PROBLEM, and we would get NO REFUND. We paid our trains alone, we spent 300e (341$) in total. Another passenger was going Canada, he paid 1000e (1139$)... In Paris we had to sleep in the AIRPORT, they didn't care because we were at our final destination.

Some flights are the Boeing 787 - which is an interesting experience - and others are the Boeing 737.  Business class in the 737 is much different from the 787.  Kenya is expanding, and will soon start its daily service NBO-JFK; and offering that new route has shaken up its schedule all over Africa.  Traveling within Africa is very often scheduled at inconvenient times; that, in my view, is an opportunity for an African airline if it would wish to make the investment.  For this flight - the 737 business class had plenty of leg room and the service was attentive.  The food in business was the same as in economy, except it was on a china plate.  Many of the North American, European and African airlines could learn from the service provided by their Asian competitors.

We were supposed to be picked up from the airport in Dar Es Salaam by our tour guides and taken straight on a 3 day safari. We booked and paid for our flights with Kenya Airways 2 months ago believing Kenya Airways to be a reliable airline. When we arrived 2 hours prior to our flight to check in, we were told that the flight was full. Despite the fact that we had arrived within the requested time to check in and had paid 2 months prior to the flight, we were kicked off the flight. There were multiple other passengers that also were not able to check in because of too many ticket sales - 1 of them had been able to buy a ticket that same morning online despite there obviously not being any left! We purchased our tickets 2 months ago - how were there still tickets on sale the same morning and yet we, who purchased our tickets 2 whole months ago were kicked off the flight?! This is unacceptable!! Another had arrived 2 1/2 hour prior to departure and had still been kicked off. He had also purchased his tickets much later than we had!\nWe were out in a hotel for the night with boarding passes printed for the next flight in 24 hours but also with the promise by Kenya Airways staff that early the next day they would try to find an alternative flight to get us to Dar Es Salaam earlier. We were already going to miss our airport pickup, who was taking us straight onto a 3 day safari for which I had already paid $300 US for. We were interrupted during breakfast to rush back to the airport. The staff told us we had been booked onto an Ethiopian airways flight through Addis Ababa but they did not have flight details to supply us with. They cancelled our tickets for the Kenya Airways flight that night. After a long wait in line, the check-in staff found only 1 ticket, rather than 2. They couldn’t tell us arrival time in Dar Es Salaam but checked in our bags and a long time later gave us boarding passes. On checking them, we discovered our route would now include a 26-hour stopover in Addis. Not only were we leaving a day later than our initial flight, but we would be now be arriving 48 hours later - a whole 24 hours later than if we had gone with the later Kenya Airways flight. On showing the staff at Kenya airways what they had swapped us over to, they then told us the Kenya airways flight that night was already full and we couldn't fly. Seriously, this was ridiculous. We were made to go back to the hotel and brought back to the airport that evening without any communication as to whether we would even be flying.\nThere was no offer of any compensation for the mess made by Kenya Airways - no upgrade, not even an airport lounge, no offer of a partial refund, not even an apology, even after I filed a customer complaint via their website. Instead they just say they pride themselves on customer service over and over again. We had a completely wasted day with massive amounts of stuffing around by Kenya Airways. None of it was due to anything that we did wrong. ALL of it was because Kenya airways overbooks their flights to make extra money. Won't be flying with them again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/f4/19/59/sarzra.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarzra","crvsd":"Slouds wrote a review Oct 2018","ui_header_link":"Slouds","default":"Gold Coast, Australia","phmbo":"24 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Accra - Dar es Salaam","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r628629496-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kicked off a flight we'd paid for","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I am a US citizen and my wife is a Kenyan citizen with a US permanent resident card (aka \"green card\").\n\nAll went smoothly until the agent checking paperwork at the gate immediately prior to boarding denied boarding to my wife based on the idea a transit visa was required in the UK, when in fact no transit visa is needed for our situation.\n\nTo make matters worse, when my wife returned to the ticket counter for further assistance (as instructed by the gate agent), she was told there was nothing they could do for her and that she would need to purchase an entirely new ticket. She purchased a one way ticket on KLM for $1550.\n\nOf course I immediately filed a complaint with Kenya Airways and insisted on reimbursement. After numerous inquiries into the status of my complaint, and being told an investigation was ongoing, I finally received an email on October 4 in which Kenya Airways admitted the situation was entirely their fault. They offered $300 compensation.\n\nAfter several more emails back and forth, I've concluded they will never make things right and accepted their $300 offer. It's impossible to argue with an airline headquartered in a developing country with no real consequences for appalling customer service.\n\nTheir 787 aircraft are nice (does any airline have a 787 which isn't nice?) but I would stay far away from Kenya Airways.

This obviously made our connection even tighter!\n\nSadly, the staff were extremely unhelpful and at times rude, when we asked for their help.\n\nFirstly, we asked if we could move nearer to the front to help us exit the plane quicker and we were immediately told that there was no space. This was not true as I had already gone up and spoken to 3 people who were all sat on their own in rows of 3!! As they were no help, we chose to just move ourselves about 90 minutes before landing.\n\nWe also were blocked by a very rude steward when we tried to walk through Premium economy when we were leaving the aircraft and he said all Premium Economy people needed to exit first. The guests in Premium Economy said that they were happy for us to go first as they would hate to see us miss our connection but he still would not let us go through and even put his arm up to block my partner from moving forward.\n\nWhen we arrived back in Edinburgh, only 1 of our 3 pieces of luggage was on the flight. We have since received the other two pieces but this was also an inconvenience.\n\nI would have given this 2 stars but the plane was quite comfortable and the food not bad by aeroplane standards.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lou1974Edinburgh","crvsd":"Lou1974Edinburgh wrote a review Oct 2018","ui_header_link":"Lou1974Edinburgh","default":"Edinburgh","phmbo":"601 contributions","phmbo1":"154 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Edinburgh - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r626766500-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Poor customer service","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

No, it doesn’t offer a much different experience than any other big airliner.  Kenya Airways didn’t allow advance seat selection and I got the worst seat on the plane (last row, center seat) even though I had booked weeks in advance.  I will admit the last row seats DO recline, so give the Dreamliner and Kenya Airways cudos for that, it sucks up about 6 valuable inches of cabin space.Cuisine on Kenya Airways is not surprisingly more African style, not bad, just not very European.  Service is charming.Oh here is something only men will notice:  Dreamliner toilet seats don’t stay up by themselves.  Doesn’t Boeing know how to design a proper toilet seat?  You have to hold it up yourself while you are relieving yourself.  That’s a ridiculous juggling act.  Hilarious, though.  Try not to miss.

A few months before the flight Kenyan cancelled it and the only viable flight (we had a long drive after landing in Kigali to get to our accommodation) was 7.20 in the morning.  Problem was it was an all economy flight so I had no choice except to accept that.  They refused to give a refund of the difference in fares (roughly $500 pp).  Wasn’t happy at all but accepted it.

Seemed like an advantage as the KLM flights to and from Nairobi are old Boeing 747s, while the Kenya Airways plantes are pretty new Dreamliners (787s). However they are far from providing a Dream experience.\nSeats in Economy feel very hard and stiff with the upright position being extremely upright which kind of forces you to bend your neck. There is quite a lot of recline, which is terrible for the person sitting behind someone, who recline the seat fully. My husband’s knees were repeatedly crushed and I had the entertainment screen 35 from my eyes during a 8 hour flight, where I had to ask the cabin crew request the passanger to put her seat in an more upright position during lunch to be able to eat in a fairly decent position. A very very bad experience.\nOn the flight back to Amsterdam a chicken bread and a muffin were served together with a glass of water or juice after approximately 1 hour and only after 5 hours into the flight was anything else offered to drink, amd soon after lunch was served. Passengers were starting to collect water themselves in the galley, but it seems far from ideal to have 300 people walking back and forth for something to drink during a flight.\nThe inflight entertainment is not very interesting. There are maybe a handfull of good movies, but they are not exactly new.\nThe Dreamliner seems to operate very nicely and is definately not a noisy plane, but all in all the experience flying it with Kenya Airways was not good. We got safely from a to b on time, and this for a considerable amount of money.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25bettinap","crvsd":"Bettina Fynholt P wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"Bettina Fynholt P","default":"Goes, The Netherlands","phmbo":"36 contributions","phmbo1":"31 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Amsterdam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r619835392-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Dreamliner “nightmare”","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The plane used was a 737-800 with a 3-3 layout - way too cramped for a long-haul flight and with Zero inflight entertainment - nothing - nada. For dinner we were each given a plastic tray with a little bit of rice and stew - no tray, no desert, not even the usual stale bread - just the little hot snack - served with a throw-away coffee pack (plastic teaspoon, sugar and creamer - yip - you ate your beef stew with the plastic teaspoon).

Flight KQ706\nUpon arriving at the check in desk, I am informed that the flight was overbooked by 30 people and i would need to be put on another flight\nI offered to pay extra to upgrade - to no avail. I then accepted to be on KQ704 departing at 1410\nA KQ desk attendant called Mary assisted me (good service) quickly, printing out my boarding pass and checking in my bag for the 1410 flight.\nShe passed me on to William for the compensation and the action whilst i wait for my flight at 1410 (KQ704)\nWilliam was struggling with the load of the KQ706 customers that had faced the same problem. There were some very irate people. After about and hour he then assisted me by helping me to get the $50 compensation\nHe then tells me to go through immigration and look for the KQ desk inside the airport\nI did exactly that. At arrival at the KQ desk i was informed that the resolution to my issue was actually a hotel stay up until my flight. However I needed to exit immigration to be assisted. So William had given me wrong instruction.\nI asked the ladies at the desk if i could at least stay in the airport and be given seating in the KQ lounge instead of exiting immigration again and they said that they could not give me seating in the priority lounge and my best solution to comfort was the hotel.\nI considered this and I did exactly as they recommended as it was still early…730am or so.\nI waited in a que at the KQ desk at the arrivals terminal for about 20 minutes. I was finally assisted by the lady who then sent me to the shuttle to go to Summerdale ‘hotel' with a voucher\nI boarded the shuttle which was cramped.\nI suffered through the traffic. The shuttle had 3 drop offs , Tamarind, Weston and Summerdale.\nWhen we had traveled about 20 minutes the driver stops at a lay-by along Mombasa highway and swops with another driver. That was my first point of worry, but i let it pass.\nWe continue and in about another 10/15 minutes, the bus starts smoking ( i have a video of this- the video also shows the dingy quality of the bus)…it was smoking from the inside and outside….all the passengers were concerned and we all raised alarm.\nThe driver just asked people to open the windows and we proceeded\nThe driver says we should carry on to Tamarind where he would get another bus. Finally boarded bus which arrived at Summerdale Inn (not Hotel as the voucher indicated) at about 930. The Inn is in a horrible looking part of town and looks like a 1/2 star establishment .\nRooms were not ready\nWe were told to go to breakfast.\nAt breakfast the food ran out. What was left was off, the bacon had a stench and smell.\n\nKQ responded to my complaint with a long email justifying why they overbook...(because they do not think 30 people will make the flight) and offering me a silly $50voucher. Not acceptable.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanaChinhara","crvsd":"AlanaChinhara wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"AlanaChinhara","default":"Harare, Zimbabwe","phmbo":"100 contributions","phmbo1":"56 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Harare","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617986358-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"No pride in this experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The connecting flight to Accra is scheduled to depart at 1am but it seems like nobody told the crew about it... it only leaves at 2am.

Only when passengers started to make a scene (after the 2nd delay was announced) did Kenya Airways realise they needed to do something to make it up to their passengers. It took them an hour to get the passengers allocated to hotels and on unroadworthy transport.

Even this may start to reduce further after my last flight. As i climbed on board, the supervising attendant on business class greeted me warmly and said they would try and make my journey a very pleasant one. This all started going wrong immediately after take off - i went to use the washroom and all of a sudden the door behind me opens. One of the attendants opened the door without even giving me a second to respond after knocking... it was ridiculous and thankfully my back was facing him. He never came to even apologize until i raised it with the supervisor later. I'd even let that go... but then it was time for lunch. The starters were served and i waited patiently for my main course. The passenger next to me then tapped me on the shoulder and asked if i had ordered anything and when i said yes, she felt really uncomfortable as she has finished her meal and i was yet to be served - i said it must be taking long but after another 10 mins or so she called the attendants to ask and they had forgotten my meal and said they now had to heat it. 30 mins passed until i called for the attendants again and this time the supervisor came - apologized that they had run out of the option i picked and so were taking one of the crew meals that was the same and needed to defrost and heat that up. All in all i got served over an hour after my fellow passenger was served.\nSomething else to note is Kenya airways won't serve you champange unless you ask for it when you first board. No water bottles are provided either again until you request for one.\nFor the price you pay, the value for money and service is sub-standard compared to the likes of Emirates. The skyteam lounges also do not compare to the Emirates lounges.\nI may still fly KQ, but it may be more out of convenience... if i don't have to worry about time, i'm definitely sticking to one of the other airlines which has a higher level of comfort, better food and way better service!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pareet_Shah","crvsd":"Pareet_Shah wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"Pareet_Shah","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"16 contributions","phmbo1":"16 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Paris - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617613323-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Convenient to fly, but business class service standards need a big step up in comparison to other airlines!","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The lounge is modern and comfortable and offers internet which is not the fastest but it's good enough for light streaming and work. The lounge offered a good variety of drinks and the food also was varied and tasty. The service was awesome despite the high number of travelers inside the lounge. This lounge is definitely 10/10.\n\nThe flight was a little bit late about 20 mins which is very very good for Kenya Airways... About 1.5 to 2 years back the norm was 1 hour if you are fortunate and all types of questionable reasons were given.\n\nOnce inside the flight was comfortable the food was good and the drinks choice was good. Kenya Airways have really changed for the better.\n\nThe only reason they don't quite get a 10 is because the selection of movies was very limiting and the choices of what to eat was also very limiting. They only offered one type of red wine. Apart from that the service was outstanding.\n\nI look forward to a business class trip in one of the bigger planes over a longer distance since this was a small Embrier.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keepitrealtravel","crvsd":"keepitrealtravel wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"keepitrealtravel","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"14 contributions","phmbo1":"27 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Mahebourg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617511350-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Getting there 👏🏾👏🏾","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This means that if you are seated towards the end (which we were) you’ll be served nearly an hour and so after they start serving food. Also they don’t turn off lights for passengers to sleep until really late (credit to the poor food distribution and cleaning setup)!\n\nIn-flight entertainment is outdated too.\n\nOnly 2 restrooms for the entire economy class for a such a long duration flight.

The breakfast was a spinach pie with some sort of little sausage inside. This in combination with the high temperature on board(especially in the front, same story on the way back!) and the sunheat from outside (these modern windows turn a lovely blue but do NOT reflect the heat!) and 4 typical loud americans on 3 seats in front of me (2 little screaming little princes) almost made me throw up all over the nunn and pastor next to me. Fortunately i could just hold back till I reached the toilets, I needed 2 hours on the jump seat to recover a bit. The biggest problem is that with this airline you are not able to choose your seat. You check in online as soon as this is allowed, 30 hours before departure, but all seats will be crossed out, and you will have to take the seat you are allocated. For someone of 6ft3 this is extremely frustrating. You can call Kenya Airways in Nairobi , London or Amsterdam, nothing will help. Make an account first to start chatting to them worked on the way to Amsterdam to avoid the middle seat, but the aisle seat I wanted was not available anymore. Oh well, at least we got there safely, and we didn't blow a tyre and flew off the runway in Amsterdam, like the previous time I flew them, almost 20 years ago.  The price was good though.

I Even tell her I recently visited Nigeria and show her the stamp to show her I really just forgot. Only when I ask her that is when she refers me to the airport clinic which am sure she knew was closed by 7pm. She also tells me that they will stop checking in at 23.20 I had got the by 22.10 which was obviously a lie. So I walk to the other end ( very far 20min) to the clinic. Luckily the security at the clinic was so helpful he even organized a cab for me to the nearest 24 hour clinic 5 minutes away at arwyp. Arwyp is actually got a 24 hour travel clinic which were so efficient I was done in10 minutes.\n\nSo my complaint is, am sure it's not her first time to come across people who forget tor don't have the vaccine so instead of telling people to cancel flights mind you all the hotel and holiday reservations confirmed and paid... could she not at least assist or tell me about the clinic. It would be shocking if she doesn’t know about the clinic just ouside the airport...Did she want me to bribe her???? I finally get the card, check in then again at the boarding gate am asked to produce and I notice it's only me no one else. Did she just try and jeopardize my trip.\n\nKindly look into this as I doubt your airline would have refunded me this ticket. She knows who I am as I told her am definitely writing a complaint. Where on this earth does a air steward tell a client to change travel dates because of a yellow fever certificate I had just forgotten.\n\nMarian Amoo","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/80/72/ce/amanzima.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amanzima","crvsd":"amanzima wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"amanzima","default":"Windhoek, Namibia","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Mombasa","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r616353038-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Very rude unhelpful check in experience ","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Given our earlier online research when choosing seats, we suspect that it was because the flight wasn’t very full, but they wouldn’t comment despite being asked directly.\n\nThus, instead of taking a reasonable mid-afternoon flight, we were put on a 02:40 (very early morning flight), obviously far less desirable. Luckily, we had built in some buffer before our onward international flight, but this essentially trashed our planned overnight stay in NBO.\n\nTo their credit, they provided a voucher for a local hotel to wait out the 12 hr delay, but given the highly unsatisfactory original flight cancellation, we strongly advise future travelers to avoid Kenya Airways, especially if you have a tight or critical connection.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/79/3a/b0/bern-shen.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bern_Shen","crvsd":"Bern_Shen wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"Bern_Shen","default":"San Francisco, California","phmbo":"152 contributions","phmbo1":"106 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Antananarivo - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r615146387-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Expensive flight cancelled","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At first I overlooked the airline as just regular-I guess on economy one looks to the arrival than the journey. But I must say that on all 4 trips, the airline was timely (I had in the past heard to the contrary). The December trip was infact most enjoyable. Leg room! I was on a seat by the emergency exit (try it). The airline stewards looked after us superbly. To this day I still regret recently taking ‘some’ direct airline and forfeiting Kenya Airways which has a via Nairobi to the same destination. Lesson learnt. I’d sooner go on Kenya Airways if it has a route to some destination! Forget its past reputation.

Once back at the airport, there were further delays, and expected arrival times were wrongly communicated. We did get a 200 dollar voucher, but this has to be spent only on KQ flights or luggage and has to be used in the next 6 months.

The cabin attendants' uniforms were impeccable & the female cabin crew had every hair in place & make up perfect. The business class seats in the 737-800 were recliners with foot rests & very comfortable. This aircraft was used from Cape Town to Nairobi. From Nairobi to Schiphol & return, Kenya Airways uses the Dreamliner & in this aircraft the seats are flat bed. Again, the service was excellent. The choice of food from the menu is varied enough for all palates. The fruit served was attractively  presented & of high standard. Lovely South African wine was on offer as also French Champagne. The return journey was on an E190 & I felt that the seating in the business class was of the standard of business class of yesteryear. The seats reclined (slightly) no foot rest. I had a glitch on my return flight. Kenya Airways customer care services replied in detail to my letter to them & didn't try to \"pass the buck\" but thanked me for my feedback & would pass on my comments to the relevant departments for ensuring that my \"glitch\" would not recur.

Your flight was delayed leaving Johannesburg...causing us to miss our 6:30pm connecting flight to Arusha.  These things happen.  I went to the Kenya Airways desk and was told they could put me on an 11:50pm flight that would land in Arusha at 3am after a stop in Zanzibar. I quickly went online to see if there was an earlier flight on any airline.  Turns out there was a 10:50 direct flight on Precision Air.  I asked the ground staff about that flight...as it does not take a rocket scientistwould rather get to Arusha at midnight verse 3am. They said \"that flight is Precision Air\". I actually had to say \"and who runs Precision Air?\"  When she responded \"Kenya Airways\"...I just looked at her...and thankfully the lightbulb slowly came on and she then asked if I would like to take that flight.  Where is the common sense that I would prefer to get to my destination 3 hours earlier, especially late at night.  My son finished the climb a day early, so I called to get my return moved a day earlier.  The change price quoted was more than it would cost to just buy new tickets online.  How is that  possible?  So, I bought new tickets online to Dar and took a different airline home.  Think about that...at that point, I would rather pay more money to fly home on a different airline.  Seriously, I would rather pay more money to NOT fly on Kenya airline.I wrote in a complaint.  21 days later they responded only to ask for copies of my tickets.  I responded with my booking reference. 30 days later they asked for my tickets.  I sent them all my invoices with multiple flight and ticket references.   They will close the case and call it a win.  I do not expect to hear back.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickwmccabe","crvsd":"patrickwmccabe wrote a review Aug 2018","ui_header_link":"patrickwmccabe","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Arusha","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r601883986-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Never fly them again","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The ticket price will be high, the travel time long, be very expensive, and most times you have to leave the continent to travel from one country to the other.  Luckily, there are African companies that are making travel within Africa more affordable and convenient; both Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways.  Both are the flag carriers of their respective countries, both seem to have updated fleets, good schedules, and both seem reliable.  I was looking to travel from Nigeria to Tanzania, and return from Rwanda back to Nigeria and in looking at my options both Ethiopian and Kenyan came up in the search.  Both were competitive in price and both had about the same overall travel time, but I choose Kenya Airways for a couple of options: 1) I had flown Ethiopian on my way into Nigeria so wanted to try another airline; 2) it had been about 4 years since I had flown Kenyan so wanted to see what updates were available; 3) the departure timings for Kenyan were better; and 4) Kenya had more options in terms of flight scheduling. Booking travel with Kenya was very easy through the website.  The site was easy to book and manage your reservation.  I had to make some modifications to my reservation and that could not be accomplished online, so they either have a chat function available or a call center; both of which were helpful.  Another good feature about Kenya is that they offer refunds on your ticket – if your schedule changes and you need to cancel your ticket, you can ask for a refund instead of travel credit.  The refund amount depends on your ticket and class of service, but everything is available online and usually the refund is processed within 4-6 weeks.  A great service from Kenya.After booking my flight, I managed my reservation through the Kenya Airways app.  Through the app and website I was able to preselect my seats for free, request a special meal, and add my Skyteam frequent flyer number.  I was also able to check-in and print my boarding pass directly from the website 24-hours prior to my departure.  My first flight was from Lagos to Dar Es Salaam via Nairobi.  The Lagos to Nairobi sector was scheduled to depart Lagos at 10:45p and arrive into Nairobi at 6:05am, and then I had 45 minutes to connect to my other flight which was scheduled to depart Nairobi at 6:55am and arrive into Dar Es Salaam at 8:20am.  This was a tight connection, but this is what Kenya Airways provided me and everything was booked on one ticket so I went ahead with it and hoped for the best.  The first flight was operated by a Boeing 737-800 with a 3-3 seat configuration.  The aircraft operates the Nairobi to Lagos sector, and the same planes brings passengers back to Nairobi.  The incoming aircraft arrived late, and the turnaround time was slow, thus boarding began well past the 10pm which was listed on the boarding pass.  Boarding was done by groups and the groups were strictly enforced; this made for a lengthy and delayed boarding to an already delayed flight.  First impressions upon entering the aircraft were good, as it looked like a new-ish plane with updated seats and personal PTV for each seat.  Each seat also contained a blanket, a pillow, and headphones on them.  The seat pitch was decent, not too tight but not too generous either (I am 6’1 and while my knees were not hitting the back seat, there wasn’t tons of room either) and the seat comfort was also average (it was fine for a 3hr flight but there needed to be more comfort for the longer flights).  Each seat contained a PTV with a USB port and headphone jack, a tray table, and then a seatback pocket with the airline magazine, the duty free, and an airsickness bag.  The doors finally closed, we pushed back for the gate, and headed to the runway for the 5hr 20mi flight to Nairobi.Kenya Airways is a full service airline so complimentary meals and drinks are provided.  Once we reached cruising altitude, the meal and drink service commenced.  The special meals were delivered at the same time as the regular meal, and for the regular meal there was an option between two choices.  I had ordered a special meal and while I appreciate being served a meal (as these days meals are disappearing from economy), the quality of the meal was not that good.  It was a decent quantity, not too much food but not too light either (perfect for a 4hr flight) but the quality of the food definitely need to be improved.  Complimentary soft drinks, tea, and coffee were also provided.  Once the meal service ended, passengers sat back and watched their screens.  The PTV screens were already on once you sat down, so most passengers just watched the entertainment program the entire flight.  There was a decent selection of TV shows and movies, again good enough for a 3-4 hour flight but you would get bored on longer flights.    Even though we departed late, we landed roughly on time and taxied to the gate.  There is a separate line for transferring passengers, but because Kenya is starting new flights to the U.S. they have modified the transit so all passengers must go through enhanced screening.  While I understand the security of this, it adds time to the transit process and this needs to be factored into the connection time they provide to customers.  There was a HUGE line of passengers in the transiting security line and it looked like I was going to miss my connection when the airline itself started to call out passengers for my flight.  A representative was pulling passengers and putting them ahead of the security line as I only had a total of 25 minutes to make my connection.  Since I was moved to the front, I went through security and ran to my gate in time to make it to my flight.The second flight was operated by an Embraer 190 with a 2-2 seat configuration.  While the plane size was small, the seat pitch and comfort were nice and each seat had its own PTV screen as well as USB port.  The plane was only half full so the doors closed and we pushed back for an on-time departure.  Since there were not that many passengers, I was able to move up and stretch out to a row unto myself.  Even though the flight time was 1hr30min, a light breakfast was served just after take-off.  The breakfast consisted of a fresh croissant which was nice, warm and fresh.  It was small but it was nice and that is something I appreciated from Kenyan, especially on this short flight.  Tea, coffee, and complimentary drinks were also served with the meal.  Once the meal service end, most passengers either slept or watched the entertainment system.  The system was not as extensive as the system of my Lagos to Nairobi flight, but there was a decent selection of TV shows to pass the short flight time.  We soon landed in Dar Es Salaam and luckily my bags also made the tight connection in Nairobi.My return flight was scheduled differently than my outbound flight.  I was returning from Kigali to Lagos via Nairobi, and I had scheduled a long layover in Nairobi.  My flight was scheduled to depart Kigali at 8:30am and arrive into Nairobi 12:35pm, and I was then going to connect to my flight departing Nairobi at 6:35p and arriving back into Lagos at 9:50pm.  The first flight was operated by an Embraer 190 and has a stop in Bujumbura.  The flight was supposed to board at 7:45am, but that came and went without any announcements.  Finally, the announcement was made and we boarded the plane.  This plane looked similar to the plane that I had taken from Nairobi to Dar Es Salaam, with the same legroom, the same individual PTV’s on each screen, and the same 2-2 configuration.  The flight time from Kigali to Bujumbura was only 45 minutes so most passengers past the time watching their screens.  The passengers on the plane consisted of passengers flying from Nairobi to Bujumbura (who stopped in Kigali); passengers flying from Kigali to Bujumbura; passengers flying from Bujumbura to Nairobi; and passengers flying from Kigali to Nairobi (who stopped in Bujumbura).  We landed at Bujumbura, where some passengers got off while others got on, and set off for Nairobi.  Since this was a longer flight, at 1h55m, both a beverage service and a meal service were provided.  The flight was uneventful and we landed in Nairobi close to on-time.After a scheduled delay, I fought my way through Nairobi traffic to connect to my 6:35p flight to Lagos.  Even though we had boarding groups assigned to us, these were not enforced and everyone boarded as they pleased.  The operating aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, the same aircraft that brought me from Lagos to Nairobi.  The layout was the same, the seat pitch and seat comfort were the same, and again each seat had their own PTV screen.  As this was my fourth flight with Kenyan in the span of two weeks, I had basically exhausted the entertainment options by this point.  As the flight time was 5hr15m, after takeoff a meal and beverage service were provided.  For the rest of the flight, the attendants were not present at all until it was time to get the aircraft ready for landing.  They attendants did not come by with water or to pass through the cabin to collect trash; the attendants just sat in the back talking.  After a bit of a delay, we finally landed in Lagos a bit behind schedule.Overall, it was a decent experience with Kenya Airways.  Since my last experience with them, some aspects have improved while others have stayed the same.  They definitely have a better on-board product versus what they previously had, and that makes for a better inflight experience.  The food quality still is average, and the overall customer service still needs to be improved.  I had some great flight attendants and great customer service, and I had some really apathetic ones.  I would not hesitate to fly them again, but I would just keep my expectations manageable.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/ec/ef/5f/0504traveller.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0504Traveller","crvsd":"0504Traveller wrote a review Jul 2018","ui_header_link":"0504Traveller","default":"Kenner, Louisiana","phmbo":"4878 contributions","phmbo1":"498 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lagos - Dar es Salaam","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r600610990-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Decent flight within Afirca","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Kenya staff at DXB blatantly lied to all 38 South African passengers onboard assuring us that our connection flight would not be missed. Zero attempts were made to ensure that we were put on the next available flight after our flight had already departed. Zero attempts were made to ensure providing even a little comfort for us whilst we endured a lengthy wait for our new connection flight. No compensation offered for their mistakes and delays. Staff were indifferent to our frustrations and had no way of dealing with any of our concerns.

Was leaving the country with another airline at 10:20 pm the same day. The evening before the flight I checked in on-line and showe up at the airport two hours before take-off. At that point I was asked if I was flying at 9 pm. When I said no I was informed that my flight at 5 pm had been cancelled. I got no e-mail and no sms telling me so. I was told to wait as a superviser would look into my case, if I could get a flight with a \"sister airline\" (Jamboair or something like that). While I waited I saw that the airline 540 was leaving to Nairobi at 5:20. After waiting for half an hour without hearing from that supervisor I complained and demanded to know if I could get a flight with that sister airline - because if that was not an option I would pay for another ticket with 540. The people at Kenya airways were unable to tell me if I could get on the sister airline flight, they just told me that I would be on standby there. Because of that I wanted my money back so I could just book another flight with 540 (the same price, about 9000 Ksh). But that was impossible, they said. But getting that answer took so long that the 540 flight was about to take off, and it was too late to get on board. After about 2 hours I was finally told that I could get a flight with Jamboair, so I did make it. But this was not a pleasent experience. I flew with them from Mombasa to Kisumu and back earlier during that same visit and the flight to Kisumu was an hour and a half delayed, no reason given.  So I would not rely on Kenya airways. Cancelling the flight last minute without any notification like that is unacceptable and highly stressing. And they call themselves the pride of Africa.

I had a low expectation about the flight, inflight service as well as ground staff. But to my surprise, it was all wrong.\n\nThe flight from Dubai to Nairoby was widebody Boeing 787-800, with flat bed seats. Very cordial staff.\nNairoby to Accra was narrowbody Boeing 737-800. Though not comfortable as 787-800, it was reasonably good. I was informed that all the international, outside African flights from Nairoby, they use, 787-800 with flat bed seats in busiess class and narrow body for inter African flights.\nHowever, during my return journey, both legs (Accra-Nairoby and Nairoby-Dubai) were narrow body aircrafts.\n\nI had a long layover at Nairoby during my return journey. And I was offered hotel accommodation.\nThe experience was terrible at the airport immigration. According to the information I got from some of our staff flew on the same flight a few days before, was taken out from the arrival and gave accommodation.\nI had to wait in the immigration for about and hour and a half, pay US$ 20.00 for a transit visa. Went to the Kenya Airways counter who arranged accommodation. It was quite slow.\nI was offered stay at Four Point Sheraton and had a wonderful experience in the hote too.\nOverall experience-very good.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kunnampaths","crvsd":"Kunnampath S wrote a review Jul 2018","ui_header_link":"Kunnampath S","default":"Thrissur District, India","phmbo":"29 contributions","phmbo1":"22 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dubai - Accra","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r594745237-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"My experience with Kenya Airways","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Kenya airways operates daily 2 flights to BOM -KQ205 & KQ211. The inbound (KQ205) aircraft 5Y-CYD was late into BOM by 37mins. I was little surprised (and more nervous) because of the fact that my connection in NBO for SEZ (KQ250) was only 50mins- which could have possibly gone!\nB737NG of kenya airways comes with 16 premier seats and 129 standard economy seats. The aircraft was newish with spotless cabin, clear flight deack announcements and fortunately also had next generation sky interiors. Seats were well upholstered and had well worn cusion and a blanket. Before we were about to pushback, I had a word with pilots and asked me for a cockpit visit in non critical phase of flight.\nAfter being warmly welcomed by the Flight attendants i was delightfully guided towards my seat. Soon flight deck announcements started and we were ready for the pushback. Soon after takeoff from RWY27, wet tissues were given and south indian breakfast was served. It tasted good when compared with other inflight breakfast I had in past. Cabin crew was efficient and worked smoothly without fuss. Later after the breakfast drinks were served. It included Soda, wine ,beer, tea, coffee with handful variety of juices to choose from. I chose Fresh Apple. In-flight entertainmaint worked well but the headphones had defective left earpiece. I was then given another one.\nSoon after that cabin crew asked me a cockpit visit. As I entered the cockpit Capt. Simon masau greeted me and said \"We dint forget you yaa!\" This was something so good of them. Later my journey was commensed on the jumpseat. I had a great time with Capt Simon and F/O Kalya Glenn. We cruised at 34,000ft and landed at NBO with a delay. soon after I had to rush to my connecting flight gate. While rushing towards Gate14, I heard my name getting announced at the terminal for the final call. They held the connecting flight to Mahé for me- Something airlines tell but rarely do.\n\nConclusion- They are worth considering and are a cut above some of the African competitors in terms of food and comfort.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhavyasoni","crvsd":"bhavyasoni wrote a review Jul 2018","ui_header_link":"bhavyasoni","default":"Mosgiel, New Zealand","phmbo":"57 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Victoria","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r593973509-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Maybe the best airline in African subcontinent.

Now after the Aircraft was cleaned we are taking off and the Captain (Mashasha Muchiri) and his team treat us to the most spectacular view of the Victoria falls a 360º fly by, YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS, forget the in-flight entertainment it was awesome the Victoria falls are awesome but when you get to fly by over the falls from above its beyond words, I recommend if you are flying to Cape Town, Kenya Airways would be best choice.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/09/f5/83/xabrahamali.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xabrahamali","crvsd":"xabrahamali wrote a review Jun 2018","ui_header_link":"xabrahamali","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"38 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r588338608-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya Airways goes to Cape Town","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This worked well for the CPT NBO sector but that is where it ended. I could not check in for my onward flight KQ8520 NBO EBB and eventually gave up frustrated that I had to go to the airport to drop off my bag ahead of the flight without a boarding pass for my final leg.\nThe Kenya Airways staff at the airport in CPT were helpful but also defeated, unable to offer any explanation why they too were unable to check me in for my final leg.\nThe flight then left on time, positive and eventually reached Nairobi 45 minutes early, a life saver for me to make my connecting flight which was taking off from a different terminal making an endless walk necessary.\nBut first things first ... In my meal did I find a piece of plastic in the slice of cake, kept it for the crew, handed it to them and it was taken without any apology or regret. I hope it was reported after landing because that should not happen unless for careless catering staff and poor quality control.\n\nTransit in Nairobi was a nightmare for me ...\n\nFirst, arrival security control at JKIA had ONE, yes ONE station operating and the queue kept growing and growing by the minute, of departing passengers from Nairobi being screened alongside more connecting passengers from flights just landed. By the time I reached the front of the queue three other stations had just opened, and of course those coming last were served first causing audible curses and comments from those who had stood in line for long.\nNext, in addition to the regular and often mind boggling stuff one sees at security checkpoints, I was asked to remove my scarf, which in the worst of scenarios did not resemble a weapon and anything of metal below would have been captured by the scanner. Well, given the short fuse security agents have these days and the gusto with which they bundle objecting passengers to interrogation cells for strip searches had me bite my tongue but I think my face told him what fate I wished upon him.\nFinally through, my scanned scarf once again tied around my neck I was able to get to the transfer desk of Kenya Airways. There, after enduring another lengthy wait, I was then told upon brief inspection of my itinerary print that I should proceed to Gate 5 as the lady at the KQ counter ‘could not help’ to get me a boarding pass. Pointing at the KQ flight number did not help either but prompted her to say one revealing and one outright s***** thing: One was that their systems are not aligned and she could see my booking on the KQ system but but could not act on it as she had no access to the Jambojet system. Second I was told that Jambojet was wearing pink while Kenya Airways was wearing red uniforms which showed they were different and could I now move to make space for other customers queuing behind me.\nI reached Gate 5 after a mile long trek through the entire next terminal, exactly half an hour before departure – and had KQ 785 not landed 45 minutes early I would have reached Gate 5 only after the flight had been closed.\nThe Jambojet staff, when hearing the story, apologised for the inconvenience of not getting a boarding pass on check in or at the KQ transfer desk, apologized for the long walk and then, lo and behold, I had to go through another security check?!? Thank you but no thank you JKIA and KAA, this was as pathetic as it comes!\nSame routine with laptop out, again, shoes off, again, pockets emptied, again and belt buckle removed, again BUT, no one bothered with the weapon of mass destruction around my neck, aka scarf, this time … so much for consistency and training of those deployed to operate the checkpoints.\nOn board of Jambojet, notably no life vests but a demonstration of how to use the seat as a flotation device, again having me thing of the unthinkable, when the passengers are busy first dismantling their seats before they could escape out of a sinking plane …\nAnd, of course, full fare ticket notwithstanding, I was asked to pay for tea and a snack which on a proper KQ service would have been included in my fare for a flight on the same sector.\nMy conclusion, never again a codeshare combination which involves Jambojet and for a long time no return to KQ as long as I can avoid them.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado","crvsd":"Safariafficionado wrote a review Jun 2018","ui_header_link":"Safariafficionado","default":"Kampala, Uganda","phmbo":"3100 contributions","phmbo1":"490 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r588204660-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The code share between Kenya Airways and their subsidiary Jambojet is made in hell","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This is entirely due to TripAdvisor's continued apathy and inaction to introduce a 'Good' column as an in between of average and very good ... Were there a 'Good' column to tick, I would ... all else was average though ... As always I started my trip prep with an online check in right when it opened up, which worked well for the EBB NBO sector but then let me down as for the NBO CPT sector I could not change the seat, indicating 'full house' but on boarding in Nairobi it turned out there were plenty of spare seats. The crew did not permit a seat change saying that seat could be taken by a passenger boarding in Livingstone but even out of Livingstone were there quite a lot of empty seats so I was just shaking my head. Breakfast service on the EBB NBO sector was prompt and friendly, the meal service to  Livingstone slowish and drinks, in particular tea, was served very late by a crew which did their job but that is where it ended.

It was our first time flying with them, and the leg room and value for the flight is what sold it to us.\nOn the day of the flight we received a text at 2am telling us our flight had changed to 11:30am - it was originally planned for 6pm. This was then followed by another text which told us it was actually delayed to 8pm. Then followed by a few other texts telling us our connection was delayed then it was not delayed - in the end the 2 hour delay resulted in us having 25 minutes to catch our connecting flight.\nBoarding time was 6:30pm, we didn't get on the plane til 7:45pm - there was no explanation to why the plane was originally delayed and followed by another delay. Once on the plane, it was followed by another 1 hour delay due to 2 passengers missing and having to remove their luggage. Finally took off about 9pm which resulted in us missing our connecting, however this was delayed too and once we got to Nairobi there was a quick smooth process. We were handed our new boarding passes soon as we got through security and guided to the right gate.\nThe plane has very good leg room and we were on the dreamliner which was a new plane - the windows have the new tinted option instead of blinds. However, my headphone output was not working so I could not watch any of the limited in-flight entertainment provided. The food was very basic and was still hungry afterwards. The flight attendants didn't check up on passengers during the flight either.\nHOWEVER, even though my flight out was a bad experience and very frustrating the flight home was much better. Everything was on time, smooth process and we even landed 35 minutes early. Plane was comfortable, got given baby wipes once we setlled. 2 hot meals, a snack and plenty of drinks throughout the journey! The other good thing is you get snacks on the short internal flights as well, flight from Nairobi to Entebbe is less than an hour and we were provided croissant and yoghurt!\nI think you get what you pay for with Kenya Airways, I would consider flying with them again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/d0/a3/5e/tej-chau.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tej_Chau","crvsd":"Tej_Chau wrote a review Jun 2018","ui_header_link":"Tej_Chau","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"222 contributions","phmbo1":"37 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r587236049-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Mixed Feelings","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The air crews are very competent and hard working and cater with a smile on their face. The in-flight entertainment option are very good but i can not say the same for the headphones.

Once airborne things then went from bad to worse. The in-flight meal was served with no knives, even though it involved beef, bread and butter. The in-flight entertainment might just as well have not been there, as none of the passengers were supplied with headphones. When My neighbouring passengers and myself requested a further drink we were informed that we had to go to the rear of the plane and ask. When we did this, 2 male stewards were fast asleep! I managed to get this on my phone camera, upon which one of the said stewards followed me back to my seat, getting confrontational and demanding to see the picture.

By this point there had been so many other issues at the airport it wasn’t worth the fight and I was defeated. I walked with her to the bank so that she could exchange the money and I went on my way. Then the flight was 90 mins delayed so we missed our connecting flight in Nairobi. We then had to stay over night and wait for the first flight out the next day. The wait for the shuttle and hotel process was awful and all of the staff were very rude.

I was impressed with their business class service on my trip to Dubai in 2017. The customer service on board was exceptional and professional, totally unexpected.\n\nTheir domestic flights however, leave much to be desired. With their aging aircraft, weird noises and sounds can be discomforting at times, however, knowing they are the rattling of latches and trolleys, you feel a little relieved. Their on time performance isn't the best, unless the coincidence of travelling with them has left almost every flight delayed by at least 20 mins, if not more.\n\nPhone service and knowledge is below standard. Mombasa customer service at airport - they seem clueless. In fact, I taught them a couple of things which after checking their end, agreed that the information I gave them was accurate. Quite frustrating when they argue with you at the airport refusing to check bags to the final destination when an interline agreement between them and another carrier clearly exists (and transit point is Nairobi out, not first point of entry into a country).\n\nBottom line, they have improved their on-board service, but leave much to be desired with ground/customer service staff.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNKafe","crvsd":"Muhammad Nazir K wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"Muhammad Nazir K","default":"Mombasa, Kenya","phmbo":"39 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mombasa - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r583596399-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Good Improvement","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

So rewarding! Chapeau to Kenya Airways for that!! Both breakfast and dinner ( on the way back ) offered a very nice choice with nice food and a large selection of wine. I would have definitely rated both flights 5/5 had the dinner been a 4-course meal instead of 3... cheese would have been so much appreciated ...   a 4.5 / 5 is for sure more appropriate!

It was disheartening to see that the luggage carrier in which they put our baggages were not covered with plastics or any other way. It was raining quite heavily. I informed the cabin crew they said they will take it further. But nothing happened. I even told the pilot cos I saw that the cabin crew didn’t take any action.

Remember Kenya is a 100% no plastic zone so don't carry plastic bags.Would definitely recommend this airline.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/10/fc/19/zee-t.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeeT007","crvsd":"ZeeT007 wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"ZeeT007","default":"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","phmbo":"91 contributions","phmbo1":"65 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Kinshasa","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r582383167-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Was impressed","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I was in for a pleasant surprise. First the hosts and hostesses. Smartly attired giving a high calibre service. They smiled, genuinely, and were polite. Once when they came to serve us a meal and my co-passenger was asleep, they signalled to me not to wake him up because they would come back to serve him when he woke up. I made a few requests on the flight and they obliged without a grunt each time. I've not experienced that level of hospitality on any flight before (not even on KLM where the hosts and hostesses work like clockwork).\n\nThe plane was very clean; as clean as the KLM hopper from Heathrow to Schipol. I guess the adherence to high standards by KLM has rubbed off on Kenya Airways. There was one stop on the journey to Harare. We stopped at Nairobi for a spell and in the air again after two hours. I must praise the pilot, whose name sounded Nigerian. He flew the plane gracefully and the touch downs were near perfect each time. I've flown Kenya Airways twice and I definitely will continue as it is cheaper than KLM.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/05/30/61/fbalintore.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciss147","crvsd":"Francis S wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"Francis S","default":"Peterborough, United Kingdom","phmbo":"18 contributions","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r582018813-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Excellent service, smooth flight","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I originally  had paid for a KLM economy class comfort seat, due to my height. On Kenyan, I got a regular economy seat, with ridiculously lack of leg space. Not only were my legs locked against the seat in front, but the guy in that seat could not recline. I ended spending Hal the almost 8 hour flight walking/standing in the aisle. They could have put me in business which was  half full (economy was full), but no. They did not even, as I have experienced in similar situations with other carriers, let me sit in the crew sears in between take off and landing. I have never experienced such a lack of understanding, and such a lack of flexibility, and I fly a LOT with many different carriers due to my work.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/86/15/f5/finn-s.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FinnS_13","crvsd":"Finn S wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"Finn S","default":"Copenhagen, Denmark","phmbo":"44 contributions","phmbo1":"13 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Amsterdam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r581792641-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Don`t fly Kenyan!","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Both legs of the journey they have the new Dreamliner aircrafts. The seats are great and so are the TV screens with plenty to watch on the Entertaiment program that they have. There was only one problem though. On the Johannesburg Nairobi flight they did not have any headsets for people to use in the economy section (not sure if they had the headsets for the business section) for the entire plane. I’ve heard of flights having a few faulty headsets or even a few short but have never heard that they forgot to load the headsets for the entire plane. Service on this flight was not the best but no major hiccups.\n\nOn the flight from Nairobi to Mumbai, however, the service was really very bad. I was on an aisle seat and next to me was a lady who was not well travelled. After the dinner service and some time in the night she remembered that she needed to take some medicine and needed water and asked me how could she get some. I promptly pressed the call button to get one of the attendants to get her some water. A few seconds later the call light went off but no one had come. This went on for the next 20-25 minutes and every time we pressed the call button the light would go off in a few seconds but no one would come. Finally one of the attendants from the front in her way to the back asked what was needed. When I told her that we had been calling someone for so long she just casually shrugged and then went away. She did manage to bring the water a couple of minutes later.\nSadly once the meal service is over then no one is bothered about any further service. No point having great new planes if the service is not improved.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YJasani","crvsd":"YJasani wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"YJasani","default":"Mumbai, India","phmbo":"27 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Mumbai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r580015155-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Great new planes but mediocre service ","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Many took to leaping through the barriers. However, once through immigration, the new side of the airport is a huge improvement on the other side (most other airlines). Coffee shops and duty free sparkle at you and the best thing of all... toilets in the departure lounge. KQ itself is in my opinion now better than British Airways. The plane is a Dream Liner and lovely and new. British Airways tends to schedule its oldest, most knackered aeroplanes or this route. I'm sure they rattle. On KQ the entertainment is excellent and they give you two proper meals unlike BA. You don't have to pay extra to book a seat before the flight and the onboard toilets are cleaned regularly. Also you can take far more luggage. Much better option if flying to Nairobi and can cope with a bit of queue barging on the way back. Hint... on the way into Nairobi sit near the front of the plane and fill in your visa form beforehand... available online. This gets you though immigration much faster. Leave plenty of time to get to the airport in Nairobi as the traffic can be hell, especially if it's raining.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565johnnya","crvsd":"Johnny A wrote a review Apr 2018","ui_header_link":"Johnny A","default":"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom","phmbo":"29 contributions","phmbo1":"12 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - London","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r576560366-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Long queue, good flight","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We sat on the plane an hour or so before take off. Once airborne, the air conditioning was either not working properly or deliberately maintained at a temperature which was too warm and uncomfortable. This was an overnight flight and I awoke feeeling hot and promptly fainted. My husband went to the galley for assistance and was told they were ‘too busy’. The air crew had been disinterested from the start. Eventually, we had assistance but by that time I had dealt with the problem myself.

It arrived late and they told me they would deliver it but they never did. Three weeks after I left the country they emailed me to say they had released it to my \"authorized representative\" and that they considered the matter closed. I did not have an authorized representative, so they just gave it to someone after I left the country and decided they were good to go. I told them this and they never responded. I contacted the appropriate government authorities and they never responded to them either. I tried to sue them but they refused to receive service. Don't fly with this people unless you have no other choice.\n\nOtherwise the flight was okay. There was a drunk loud guy who I had to (was up to) repeatedly quiet, and after the third time or so he shut up.

It is a 18 hour experience which is a hellish ride and a damn expensive one to boot. Ok, so the company is paying and I accepted eco class travel to be fair. However, for the traveling public it's a mission. Leaving Jhb at 1 am is tedious and gets you into Nairobi without sleep as dinner is served and then find yourself zombied in Nairobi Jomo airport. The non useage of a air bridge with a tight turn around to the next flight makes for frustration and little time to even grab a coffee which is damn expensive at four dollars for Africa. Wifi is good at one hour free so remember to use two devices if longer than one hour there.\nWith such a long time in a 737 the 7 hours to Accra is awful as the seats are rock hard and food very poor. This is long haul when the offering is domestic level for a full charging full service run. Entertainment is ok, if you get a newer plane but still well below top priced experiences.\nYou then sit onboard in the plane for 1.5 hours in Accra in boiling conditions with no air on. No drinks, no nothing and toilet use is limited as the plane has to be cleaned and this is priority for KA.\nThen a short trip to Monrovia and more mediocre food and another 1.25 hours in the plane on the ground , no aircon no nothing and another clean over dance on board.\nSo, now having been in a 737 for 17 hours it's 1 hour to Freetown and two packets of peanuts and a beer.hmmmm\n\nSame on the return leg with sleeping almost impossible from Accra to Nairobi as most seat buddies sit starring wide eyed at screens with all manner of sneezing and aromas in full effect.\nAdd four dumplings of health chemicals by the crew and to put it mildly one is truly concerned about overdosage once rolled off the airfield.\n\nPlus side, had the please of doing one trip business class and to put it mildly it's worth the ride if KQ offer it to you as a free upgrade but I would fork out that cash if I were paying.\n\nThe frequent flying set up is a joke. Company spent a fortune on 38 flights and I still didn't even qualify for a few lounge useages.

Definitely the best route to and from CT and we were so pleased to have chosen to stay on the Zim side of the Falls after we had visited Livingstone!","Image":"","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jangles_11","crvsd":"Jangles_11 wrote a review Mar 2018","ui_header_link":"Jangles_11","default":"Otley, United Kingdom","phmbo":"243 contributions","phmbo1":"75 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Victoria Falls","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r568568629-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Fly Kenya Airlines to Victoria Falls","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Kenya Airways routeing appeared to be the most convenient timewise, though it wasn't the cheapest option. Flying via Mumbai to Nairobi and on to Johannesburg initially they had to hold our connecting flight in Nairobi for us because we arrived late into Nairobi. Onboard, the food quality was poor and seating not that comfortable, with quite shoddy service, but there was a good choice of movies outbound.  Returning to Goa from South Africa was an absolute nightmare because most of us missed our onward connections in Nairobi due to various problems causing our aircraft to arrive over an hour and a half late into Nairobi. To be fair they put us all up in hotels in the city but some people had a 24 hour delay whereas we had a 16 hour delay to catch the next available flight. Because my connection from Mumbai to Goa was on a separate ticket they wouldn't honour this at all, so I also ended up out of pocket having to buy another ticket for the following day, with no compensation offered. It was all a real shambles and their flight schedules which only allow for minimal connection time in Nairobi means that this is something that could happen often. I wouldn't travel this route again with Kenya Airways unless I was specifically heading to somewhere in Kenya itself. It's just too much hassle.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjw2018","crvsd":"wjw2018 wrote a review Mar 2018","ui_header_link":"wjw2018","default":"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa","phmbo":"645 contributions","phmbo1":"135 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r564987338-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Flight delays, short connection times, poor food","tehyy":"","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On top of all this , when we did board we were met with dirty chewing gum stuck to the front of our chair and dirty used tissues in our seat front.  we had to call an attendant to clean it before we carried on.

We had a birdseye-view off the Vic Falls, and a comfortable flight, seamless transfer in Nairobi as well as clean bathrooms  while waiting on the airport in Nairobi.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/2f/2a/4a/ip-capetown.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IP_CapeTown","crvsd":"Ilze P wrote a review Mar 2018","ui_header_link":"Ilze P","default":"Cape Town Central, South Africa","phmbo":"138 contributions","phmbo1":"104 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r564151004-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Yes!

Almost all flights with KQ are determined by passengers of the economy class who deposit the buggages in the overhead lockers of the business class and the crew watches this helplessly.

For 2 of the legs (Dakar and Abidjan) there was no air conditioning on the ground in the aircraft. The temperatures, being West Africa after all, were unbearable. Although the B737 flown for the first 2 legs was reasonably well equipped, I am not a fan of flying long legs in a narrow body aircraft designed for regional travel. The last 2 legs were flown in an E190. In my opinion, a totally unsuitable aircraft for passengers for such a long trip. Mandatory refuelling stops en route are a testament to the fact that this aircraft shouldn't be doing such long flights.

When we were in transit in Kenya, the ground crew declined us from boarding and said we need to present return ticket otherwise we can’t get in...with extremely terrible, careless cold attitude. We never been told we need the return ticket to get in the flight/entering the country before. We flew through the same airline and no one told us about this, we almost missed our flight.\n地勤在”轉機”時擋人，突然要求出示回程機票，態度極度冷淡，差一點上不了飛機。\n2. When I claimed my luggage on arrival - my backpack’s cover was gone and one item was lost & missing.\n杯包套不見，我放在夾層的小背包也不翼而飛。\nDetails:\nMe and my boyfriend are frequent flyer and we already travel in africa for 3.5 months for 8 countries and we never had problem with flight transition in every airport/ country here.\n\nYesterday we flew from Zanzibar Tanzania to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia through Kenya airline. We checked in Zanzibar and we had all of our boarding pass/ luggage direct to Addis Ababa straightaway which is great. We only need to transit and wait in Kenya airport for 2 hours then we go- everything was perfectly ok.\n\nUntil we tried to boarding at gate in Kenya, the ground crew who called Mary she said we have to present the return ticket from Addis Ababa otherwise we can’t get in the plane. We were so shocked cos no one told us about this issue and we never been requested before.\nSo we asked: “but why the crew who checked in us to here didn’t mention anything ?”Then she replied coldly: “they only checked from Tanzania to Kenya, they are not responsible for this transit.”We were like how can this sounds like you guys work for different company and we are the two idiots.\n\nShe insisted we need to buy the return ticket otherwise there’s no way we can get in. Look at the time - We only had less then 10 minutes before gate closing but she only replied: you still have 5 minutes you can buy ticket now ...with careless attitude and totally ignored we were constantly telling her- we can get the visa on arrival for sure and we checked online before, there’s no need to present return ticket for visa (which this has been proved is true that we spent less than 10 min to have the visa on arrival in Addis Ababa by the time we got there).\nShe just walked away and we don’t understand why she declined us when we were in transit and she even is not the immigration office, also please remember if return ticket is a must thing to have then you should have told us when we were in Zanzibar not in Kenya! She even said we will move your luggage cos you can’t get in...\n\nWe were so panic but had no choice to buy the ticket on the spot... you can imagine how slow was the airport WiFi...and all the pressure.\nThen we finally allowed to get into the plane at the very last minute.\n\nThis is not the end of the story, i was then found my backpack cover missing (my only luggage is a 50L backpack with the cover) then I noticed one of my small backpack which was put in the layer was missing...it was very obvious showing this must be taken from somebody intentionally. (cos I put the bag under the layer tightly, there’s no way it could fall from my backpack)We are super disappointed about this big airline. We will never take this flight and tell people better not to fly with them either.

Trying to get hold of customer care is a mission & when you do, they are quite cold & rude.\n\nIn summary, the airline has some good aspects that might lure you, but be aware that you might encounter some unpleasant issues.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/c0/92/2f/daniel-p.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7905BSdanielp","crvsd":"Daniel P wrote a review Feb 2018","ui_header_link":"Daniel P","default":"Doha, Qatar","phmbo":"117 contributions","phmbo1":"42 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r561406332-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Be wary","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Each time I want to make an amendment to my existing ticket end up with so much problems that can take up to 3 days to resolve. They have in a number of occasions cancelled my ticket without notifying me, I end up paying more money. The staff at their offices are super rude, unhelpful and defensive. Kenya Airways are quick to take the money not give the service you pay for......SERVICE! Too much delays too!\n\nThe service I get on-board is very good except the movies have not been updated for God knows how long. I tend to see the same movies each time. I mentioned this to the stewardess and she referred me to this site, nicely though. Beatrice and Lilian at the business class from London to Nairobi on 06th December 2017, KQ 101 were brilliant, they referred me by my name throughout the flight.\n\nDISAPPOINTED with Kenya Airways offices in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.

BUT. On my last trip I tried to do the \"NORMAL\" upgrade but there was a technical problem which I could not resolve. Decided to visit the airport early to try and resolve. The ticket counter did not open at the advertised time, 20 minutes late. Waited in the Q for over 40 minutes still no service. Went to the check-in counter, a sign is displayed \"ask me about Business Class\", you can't do anything at check-in you must go back to the Ticket Office. I already had a bad experience at the Ticket Counter so I was not going to go back to experience bad service with additional time delays. If you are going to offer a service, a number of things need to happen, 1. Times advertised must be adhered to, don't open 20 minutes late 2. Don't offer \"Upgrades\" at the check-in counter only to advise me to go back to the Ticket Office. 3. if there is a technical problem on the on-line Upgrade system please advise your customers accordingly.\nI would travel Kenya Airways again as the many positive experiences out way the one negative but it does leave a negative perception.

I am very concern about the on time performance as I have to drive to Masai Mara on the first day of arrival. The crews are average, not really polite and the worst thing is they slept like log at the chair during 8 hours flight. After supper, they went to sleep and passengers have to walk to the pantry to look for drinking water. Most airlines have crews to offer water or juice to the passengers along the flight. Another bad experience was I asked for hot water to make my own coffee. The crew didn't help you to do so, she just pointed the hot water tap and let you get your water by yourself and she sit at the chair without doing anything. The toilet is a joke, never being clean during 8 hours flight and you can imagine how wet is the floor. The food is a joke.

Got an SMS to say our Kenya connection had been cancelled but we were being put on to an SAA flight only a little later so thought no problem.  Arrived in Kenya to be told that the original flight had actually been downgraded so they couldn't accomodate us on business class ( no offer to downgrade)  then the SAA flight is already full ( crap ! as my hubby went to check them boarding and definately not full- especially business class when they called it) so Kenya Airways in their infinite wisdom moved us to a later Kenya Air flight - 7 hours later.   We missed our connection to the Kruger Park and had to book into a hotel in Jhb for the night. I firmly believe they didn't want to pay SAA for our business class flights to they didn't try to get us onto the flight.  Told us to wait in the lounge for a manager, waited over 90 minutes and only got hold of someone after asking reception to contact them 3 times and tweeting Kenya Airways Customer Service.   Was told all we can get is $200 inconvenience refund but we had to contact customer services ourselves, no one in the airport ( THEIR HOME AIRPORT MIND YOU) could help.  I logged a request, and followed up with the ticket info when we got back to Dubai, 2 days ago and nothing.  Not sure why they can't refund our credit card but hey. The customer service desk in Nairobi was full of clients screaming and shouting who had flights cancelled last minute.

We are Singaporeans, so we flew into Bkk and transferred to Kenya Air to enter Nairobi.  Went on Economy and it was bearable.  The flight was stable, the food average, the service was not too bad and toilets were quite cleane.  BUT, the biggest bugbear here was the timing.  We were ready to head out to Nairobi from Bkk at midnite S'pore time.  However, the flight was so badly delayed that we only managed to take off only at 4am+!  That affected a lot of things esp those at Nairobi.  The layover time was 3hrs, the delay was another 3.5hrs, all in all, we sat at Bkk airport for nearly 7 hrs!  But still, all was good and we took off. On our journey home, I decided to give my family a treat and upgraded (with payment) to 4 Biz Class seats.  It was much better and this time, surprisingly, no delays!  It took off on the DOT!  Wow, what a treat. Biz class here is as per other biz class.  Not any better nor any worse if you compare against EUR or USA liners.  However, it would lose out to Asian liners I would imagine.  Seats were generally cleaned, reclined to straight and level, bigger screens, champagne to kick-off the flight, blankets were thick n fluffy, headphones were diff from those in Econ class, etc.  We had seat nos 3s and 4s.  So we were in the first sector of the aircraft just behind the cockpit.  As such, we had no disturbances from the Econ class side as behind us, there were another 5 rows of Biz Class.  Very quiet and lots of privacy.  Our family slept like babies and before you knew it, they were announcing to descend!  When we landed, we yearned for more time in the Biz class but...., and we landed with fresh minds and fresh bodies, very little lethargy unlike from Econ class.   If you asked me, I reckoned its all worth the upgrade and I am happy I gave my family a treat like this.  Conclusion - DO IT!  Do it the biz class way....","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/1a/7e/ee/kimck8.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimck8","crvsd":"ck k wrote a review Jan 2018","ui_header_link":"ck k","default":"Singapore","phmbo":"169 contributions","phmbo1":"43 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r550789105-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Bangkok - Narirobi  - Bangkok","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were to depart at 12h10 on 1 December 2017, stop over at Nairobi and then straight to Hanoi. In October I booked a flight (again through TRIPSTA) for my son who decided to join us.The only flight I could find for him was JHB-Nairobi-Bankok-Hanoi. I decided to book this particular flight because the three of us would at least have been able to fly together from Johannesburg to Nairobi. When we got to the Check-In Counter of Kenya Airlines I was informed that there was a problem with the tickets for me and my daughter. I was told that all flights from Nairobi to Hanoi have been suspended since 1 October 2017 and that the Booking Agency was supposed to have rescheduled our flights! I was told to contact TRIPSTA to sort out the problem. To my horror the woman I spoke to at TRIPSTA told me that there is nothing that can be done they will refund me!!?? My son had to get onto the 12h10 flight and I had already booked 4 Domestic flights in Vietnam (all paid for in advance) as well as 4 different hotels for our holiday there (Time for free cancellation of the Hotel bookings already expired) I was devastated. It was imperative that we fly to Hanoi on 1 December and not a day later. I explained this to the Check-In Clerk of Kenya Airlines and he referred me to their Booking Counter to see what can be done. They were really kind and understanding and immediately started searching for alternative options. At the end of the day my son left on his scheduled flight and me and my daughter followed at 17h10. It was such a relief I didn't even mind the 5 hour wait at the Airport.

I understand that baggage can be delayed and that mistakes happen, however I was able to get from Australia to Africa in 1 day - I struggle to understand how my bag ended up being so far behind! I was patient and laughed it off, however I found staff to be rude and careless with dealing with the situation. I found customer care to be non-existent. I have not received an apology, nor any updates on where my luggage is in the world. I have had to cancel my trip up Mt kilimanjaro and a safari due to the delay. Very disappointing Kenya Airways. I will not be flying with Kenya Airways again and would advise against it. It’s one thing to lose/delay someone bag, but it’s another thing to leave them in the dark, not answer the phone or reply to emails and provide no assistance whatsoever to rectify the error! Travellers are often on a schedule and customer service needs to be better than that. Kenya Airways could not organise a piss up in a brewery and when things go tits up, they don’t want to know about it. Do not fly with this airline internationally, if my experience is anything to go by.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/ee/c6/53/mbechy.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbechy","crvsd":"melissa b wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"melissa b","default":"Australia","phmbo":"14 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Guangzhou - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r550172847-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"What a mess","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was no explanation why the flight going in was late, but that along with a time consuming visa procedure ate into our half-day plan for Nairobi.\n\nThe flight back was postponed by 5 hours, I believe due to visibility issues, Dubai was in the middle of a sandstorm, which is really not anything the airlines could help, but they could have given us a place to rest as this meant we were sitting through the entire night at the airport. No lounge services offered, and the seating at Nairobi airport is not meant for long use.\n\nWe missed the onward connecting flight because of the delay, KQ said they had rescheduled us for a later connection, but upon arrival into Dubai we found they hadn't reissued the tickets and we almost missed that flight too in the flurry of reissue procedures and unnecessary fuss.

I must say the standard of service has gone down drastically. The only thing I can say that is positive is that the ground crew - check in staff were efficient and polite.\nThe flight was very uncomfortable, probably because I was squeezed off my seat by a huge man (fat) from DRC. Why he was given a middle seat I will never know except to say that someone thought it would be funny. I asked if he did online checkin to which he said no.\nMy seat wouldn't recline & the screen worked intermittently which made the journey extremely long!\nThe food was terrible and not enough for a child leave alone an adult. This was confirmed by the fat man sitting next to me,or rather on part of me,when he asked the steward for a second meal! Which incidentally he was given! To my disgust he was also given 2 bottles of wine to drink with his breakfast!\nThe other thing was that the toilets were filthy. On a 9 hour flight you would expect the crew to clean the toilets at least 2 or 3 times. But the floor in the two toilets I visited were soaking wet, there was no tissue and the basin was blocked in one.\nThe cabin was a mess with paper and blankets dropped which gave a feel of uncleanliness and untidiness!\nIf I can avoid flying KQ in the future I will and will not be recommending it to anyone. Definitely not what it used to be.

This went on and on and a fellow passenger told me that it was a deportee - apparently they always put them on this flight.  The deportee screamed and moaned in the hope (as I understood it) that they would be taken off the flight.  They weren't - the female passenger screamed and moaned for the first three hours.  At one point I took a walk to see where they were (right at the back of the plane) and felt so sorry for the passengers in that section who had their headphones rammed against their ears presumably with the volume turned up full blast to try and drown out the screams.  An awful experience and not the start to a holiday that you would want.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3262OPannab","crvsd":"Anna B wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"Anna B","default":"Worthing, United Kingdom","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r544984546-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Like being in a nightmare for trhe first three hours","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

KLM and KQ are flying blue partners but the way I was treated by the check in staff in London was extremely rude. I had a hand luggage and my lap top bag which KLM had allowed in the London-Amsterdam segment and in a much smaller plane than the KQ flight to Nairobi. The lady at the check in station simply told me to leave my bag with her in spite my explanation that the bag had some valuables and I had no place to transfer the same to. This hand luggage was equally the right size bag and was weighing less than 10 kilogrammes, which is why KLM allowed it in as a hand luggage.\n\nWhile KQ (Kenya Airways) is generally a decent airline, it is this kind of behavior by some of their staff (partners) that negatively impacts their customers' experience.\n\nTo make matters worse, one of their inflight attendants had a very bad attitude towards customers. unfortunately I did not take her details.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/8b/avatar012.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajei2000","crvsd":"Ajei2000 wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"Ajei2000","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"151 contributions","phmbo1":"35 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Amsterdam - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r544959827-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Reliable African airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This one particular flight had them installed but not turned on and they made no effort to inform passengers as to why this was. I wasn't itching to watch a movie but I definitely was counting on having a functioning usb outlet to charge my phone (I just assume these two seat-back functions are connected). Also because there was no room in the overhead lockers I noticed business class was about 70% empty. I asked the flight attendant if she could place my back forward and she refused and cited no reason at all. I told her that if I had to walk to the back of the plane to store my bag it would be slower for everyone getting off the plane. This didn't matter to her and that makes no sense to me at all.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris54354","crvsd":"Chris54354 wrote a review Nov 2017","ui_header_link":"Chris54354","default":"Vancouver, Canada","phmbo":"137 contributions","phmbo1":"23 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Harare","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r542686670-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Solid Airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My flight was due to leave at 00:35 to arrive in Kenya at 05:35. I received an email that my flight time has changed to depart at 05:35 instead.\n\nThen received another confusing email to state that departure is back to the original time set. Then received another email stating the departure time will be 05:00. I now very confused so I called the offices where the email was from, a travel agency?\n\nI started to worry and panic. I tried checking in online, that was also a bit confusing as the times had changed but original information was still there. It looked like you had a choice to fly the same flight at either 00:35 or 05:35am. Maybe depending on numbers they would decide when exactly do we fly? Hee hee hee.\n\nDue to the confusion, I left the hotel early to make the 00:35 flight just in case. I was one of many people who were stuck here due to miscommunication. We were ushered into a VIP Lounge for food and refreshments after midnight. How do you eat at that time of the night? We could have been comfortable in our beds. But at least we could all fall asleep in the cosy chairs while we waited for our departure time at 05:35. Four hours later our announcement to board.\n\nThe staff were super nice if that makes up for lost sleep. It was an oldish plane.

The staff could not have been less helpful if they tried. A lost bag report was provided along with a reference number but no understanding of where the bag actually was! Next morning we had to rush to find a store to buy underwear and warm clothing for my wife prior to catching an early flight to the Abadares. Despite calls every day the bag did not turn up. We were assured that the bag was in Johannesberg and we would be reunited with it when we returned to Nairobi for an overnight stay. Back in Nairobi the bag had still not been delivered to our hotel. The hotel concierge then followed up for us and was assured that the bag had come to Nairobi at 3:30 that afternoon and was to be delivered to the hotel. When I was told this I arranged transport and went to the airport to pick the bag up, only to be informed that the bag was \"not here\". Once again I was assured that the bag was in J'berg and they would send it to our next destination which was Mauritius. I had no faith that this would happen and suggested that a better plan would be to keep the bag in J'berg and we would pick it up on our way back to Australia. Everyone agreed and the bag status, I was assured would be updated on the system to reflect that plan. A few days later back in J'berg I followed up the bag only to be told it was in Paris! (I am not making this up) and they were flying it back to Nairobi so I could pick it up there. Eventually they determined it was not our bag in Paris but still could not determine where our bag actually was and suggested I fill out an insurance claim form. So here we are back in Australia on the 2nd of November and the bag is still missing!! My point is, no one actually took ownership of the issue it was all delegated to someone else and I was just told whatever I wanted to hear to get rid of me. Very bad customer service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/9a/avatar026.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2641QIstevem","crvsd":"Steve M wrote a review Nov 2017","ui_header_link":"Steve M","default":"Adelaide, Australia","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r537739116-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Staff totally indifferent.","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The return trip was more problematic. There was no attempt to indicate the KQ flight on the usual display boards in Addis apart from being told the gate number as one checked in. Only saw one ground staff before departure for the flight which was delayed. In flight- was sitting near two children, one managed to land with a seat belt unfastened- yet the mother was sitting opposite and also because there was no walk by of the crew checking seat belt compliance before landing. The safety video did not come on yet it was a fairly new plane, so the safety talk was delivered by the air stewards. Hard to see what they were doing when you are in the window seat. Far too many people got on with huge suitcases, some struggling to put them in the overhead lockers, not sure KQ still weighs hand luggage before departure. Further delay experienced in Nairobi- at least in the upgraded airport, it was not such an unpleasant experience.\nI am on KQ's frequent flyer programme and had not flown KQ for some time.

I have flown Kenya Airways and its Sky Team partners for several years now and have had no problems at all. The planes are modern (The last three times I used this airline,  I flew in a Dream Liner which is one of the latest range of luxury aeroplanes. The fares are not exorbitant compared to other airlines serving the same route. They also have a very generous baggage allowance of 2 checked bags of 23kg each and one hand luggage of 12 kg maximum. I recommend Kenya Airways to anyone wishing to fly this route in an African airline.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1e/91/f3/6d/alex-d.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexbee1","crvsd":"Alexbee1 wrote a review Sep 2017","ui_header_link":"Alexbee1","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"125 contributions","phmbo1":"41 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r526281417-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Great Airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The flight to Nairobi was almost an hour delayed and we got only informed 5min before the original boarding time - no communication at all. We made it on time to the connection flight, they were still boarding but the staff refused us - saying we were too late (they were still boarding while they were saying that!). There was no reason at all for not letting us on the plane! They just stopped talking to us and ignored us completely without giving an explanation. We had to wait 4h for the next flight, the manager came and told us it was because we were late (which is a lie) and also because there was not enough food on the plane (seriously?! It's a 50min flight and I can happily be without the low-quality sandwich offered).

I found the Johannesburg boarding smooth and attendants from check-in to actual boarding great. I had never flown in a Dreamliner before and found the leg room wonderful and seats very comfortable.  Being very sensitive to motion sickness the smooth flight was great. Food was tasty although using powdered milk in tea not great. The return flight was marred by very poor sign-boarding at Nairobi airport. Terminal A from which Air Kenya flights depart said Domestic departures necessitating several circuits around the airport making me almost late for the flight. It shoudl say ALL Air Kenya flights. Check-in clerk not very helpful and the rush was stressful.  The flight was again smooth although the attendants on this flight not as friendly.

When we arrived in Zanzibar, two of our four bags were missing. It was such a mission to get our baggage but after much trouble and going back and forth to the airport our bags arrived about 1 and a half days later. I guess this missing baggage was due to the fact that we had traveled on Kenya Airways via a connecting flight to Nairobi and Dar es Salaam so our bags probably got taken off at the wrong airport.\n\nThe airline didn't get back to any of the e mails I sent and it is very difficult to get hold of them when you are in a different country and only have Wifi. The airport staff at Zanzibar Int however, were quite helpful and managed to communicate with the relevant people that our bags were missing.\n\nIf the airline offers cheap flights, I will fly with Kenya airways again.","Image":"","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uncieray","crvsd":"uncieray wrote a review Sep 2017","ui_header_link":"uncieray","default":"South Africa","phmbo":"17 contributions","phmbo1":"11 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r520687026-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Generally satisfactory","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

However, my main problem was with one of the Kenya Airways male staff at Nairobi airport. We missed our flight from Kenya to Dubai, the staff seemed nice and assisted us in every way possible and even assisted in \"getting\" us accommodation. This was our first time in Kenya and we had no idea where to go, he told us there were no hotels near the hotel which was a lie, this was midnight, we were exhausted and we had no access to WiFi. We believed him  and he told us the nearest hotel was in town. He called a friend they charged us 3 TIMES the actual amount the hotel required. Things seemed suspicious when he began covering his name badge. We shouldn't have trusted anyone but we thought the best help would come from the airline we had used, CORRUPT staff should not be allowed to work for any airline. We never met him when we went back to the airport the following day but we did our research and found out that he had probably taken some of the money which he got from his \"travel agent\" friend.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wadzns3","crvsd":"wadzns3 wrote a review Aug 2017","ui_header_link":"wadzns3","default":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Harare - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r518751176-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Good flight but 1 corrupt Staff member","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

OK the plane didn't crash there is at least that but otherwise the quality of comfort was poor.\nFirstly it was impossible to try and block emergency aisle seats (I am nearly 2M tall). I did go on-line just before the stated 30 hours before take-off and found virtually all the seats already pre-booked so we weren't even able to sit together as a family.This is very poor service. If there is a stated 30 hour time then this should be respected. I would have paid extra for aisle seats but this option was not available.\nLeg-room is minuscule. The seats were rock hard and my bum was numb after one hour. My video screen and headphone combo was broken on the way out and also didn't work on the way back. So the main areas of comfort for long-haul were sadly lacking.The cabin-crew looked rather uninterested in the problem of video and seemed to imply there are always loads of seats where it doesn't work properly so it's just bad luck.

I asked the flight attendant to check for us, she told me it was being rebooted. It never worked for the entire flight.\n\nFlight KQ760 NBO-JNB- 03/08/2017\nOverall a pleasant flight the 787 aircraft is a delight, however I would suggest you ask your Executive Chef to travel on one of the flights. To be offered a “poached egg” with green bean/pea stew and fried cubed potatoes was to say the least disgusting. I could have played golf with the egg which was cooked so long it might have bounced. Not an experience you would want to remember.\n\nFlight KQ 765 JNB-NBO 09/08/2017\nThe check in was an experience I have never in 40 years of flying encountered before, the person who designed and implemented this process should be fired.\n1. Stand in line to have your bags weighed, not only that but hand over your passports while the airport rep completes many details in a log book, after which she gives me a paper to hand in at the check in desk.\n2. At the check in desk the airport rep again takes our passports and weighs the luggage, and completes her checks and issues the boarding cards. ( Not sure why she needed to re-weigh the luggage).\n3. We are then instructed to carry our bags to a different check in desk where they offer to plastic wrap our bags, a) our bags are already wrapped, b) the machine is not working as the man can’t find an extension cable. We are told leave our suitcases at this point unattended- ‘not a problem’ we are told as I was unhappy to leave them in the middle of the check-in hall. “no problem’ we are again told the security man is watching them. He must be very clever I stated as he is facing away from the luggage texting on his phone.\n\n4. We board the plane on time… however it soon becomes apparent that all the passengers who had been clearly required to remove excess luggage from the suitcases, have now gained considerable hand luggage… as what was coming on board was not going to fit in the overhead lockers, I felt sorry for the flight attendants who were under considerable pressure to assist passenger until the ground staff who were the same ones that had checked us in came on board to assist.\n5. The consequence was a slightly delayed departure.\n6. On arrival in Nairobi only a few minutes late due to tail winds, we were further delayed as we had to wait a considerable time to get a parking space.\n7. Once off the aircraft we moved quickly through the airport, with great assistance from security officials as we were now getting late for our connecting flight to Dar es Salaam KQ480.\n8. The PA system was announcing final calls for the flight, the TV screens were showing final call we arrived at the gate.\n9. We were met with the most unfriendly KQ agent who told us the flight had left, as I could clearly see the aircraft at the gate and as the PA system was till announcing the flight and the TV screens still showing final call, I was shocked that she refused to board us. As I pointed out from her system she must have been able to see our connecting flight had landed, she must have known we were on that flight, but no help was offered.\n10. We joined a queue at KQ Flight Service, with two agents working and a line backing up through the Duty Free area, after 35 minutes in the line the agent without any apology changed our tickets to the KQ482 departing at 11:00hrs. I was then told to return to the desk at 08:30hrs to collect Breakfast Vouchers, I could not believe she was serious!\n11. We collected our Breakfast vouchers at 08:30hrs, as instructed and were directed to gate 23 Avanti Restaurant for breakfast. On arrival we found one lady behind the counter and approx 40 guests already seated. We asked about the breakfast and were told the breakfast was “egg, sausage and bread with tea or coffee” we were told to take a seat and someone would come to take our order. After 15 minutes and the arrival of more than 30 more people from another delayed flight I asked when we could order, she was now very confused and under pressure and told us she had already ordered our breakfast, another ten minutes and it arrived, a one egg overcooked omelette and the second one one overcooked fried egg both with a sausage and two slices of toast, no butter no preserve, no condiments on the table.\n12. We eventually went to the boarding gate delighted our journey was almost over. I did bring to the attention of your agent at the gate that as well as welcoming KQ premier passengers to priority board she might also add inconvenienced passengers as a gesture that KQ was sorry for the inconvenience… I don’t think she liked my suggestion.\n13. No problem we departed on time and arrived in Dar es Salaam on time at 12:15hrs.\n14. Waiting for our luggage in Dar es Salaam one piece arrived on the conveyor belt, we waited until the belt finished for the second one, it was not there and went to lost luggage to start the process for our missing piece.\n15. OH! to our surprise the one missing luggage had come on the KQ 480. So you also allow unaccompanied baggage on your flights, I understood this was against all the security recommendations.\n\nIf you have taken the time read through this letter, and digested the contents you will appreciate the distress the actions of your employees cause to your passengers. Not a single apology throughout this ordeal. I thought I would bring this to your attention as I am sure your passengers face these problems every day, and even though in the big picture this is a minor delay in your eyes, you can clearly see how the endless problems arise from simple issues, You have a big job on your hands to turn this around but I hope you manage it. I think it will be some time before I try again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allaboutholidaysUK","crvsd":"allaboutholidaysUK wrote a review Aug 2017","ui_header_link":"allaboutholidaysUK","default":"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","phmbo":"70 contributions","phmbo1":"18 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Dar es Salaam","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r518651869-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Poor Customer Service","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The service levels of KQ have a taken a beating for sure in the past one year that i last traveled. The Food portions have grown very small and you are hungry within no time, the OnBoard beverage service has been curtailed severely. Earlier they used to have a second top up round of service for the beverages in which they would give 2 doubles of any liquour of choice per round but now it is only one round of service with very limited choice . If you need a top up then you go and ask for the same at rear where the stewards sit. Overall below average for the money they charge. I paid INR 49600 for 2 way ticket which was almost 25% more for a pared down service.\n\nAnother thing i want to share is the seating at the emergency exits. I noticed a bulky 70 year or so old man in middle seat and his more bulkier, burqa( Bui Bui) clad wife seated at the window seat of the emergency exit row.

The trip started with cancellation of KQ 211 on 30th July. The office booking team of Kenya was very cooperative in routing the group of 34 on Emirates transiting through Dubai. Internal flights on Kenya Airways to Victoria fall, return via Zambia to Seychelles and back were all good flights cooperative staff, clean planes, on time flights and decent food. The mess up was instructions on special meals were all mixed up as a result vegetarians were on the first sector got only bread and butter. The staff was very cooperative helped with getting the food preferences corrected for next flight which was good .\n\nHowever our experience on the return from Nairobi was pathetic. The flight was delayed for over an hour even when the plane was there we were waiting for connecting passengers on delayed flights coming in. We had a connection to Delhi from Mumbai and even on telling the boarding staff of this got the reply why did you not use our interline partner Jet Airways? Our request to send a message to Air India that a group joining he flight to Delhi is on a delayed flight got no attention from them. Who are they to question which flight we use!!!!\n\nIn Flight service, very arrogant attendants who clearly showed that they do not like doing the job with their attitude. So move over get another job but do not trouble the passengers. I heard a fellow traveller tell the attendant if he change the preferred meal to another meal. Reply was a curt NO when at least 4 passengers around where we were sitting opted not to take any meal. A very poor level of service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyKochhar","crvsd":"Sunj Look InyKoijjJkiiki Mmchhar wrote a review Aug 2017","ui_header_link":"Sunj Look InyKoijjJkiiki Mmchhar","default":"Istanbul, Turkey","phmbo":"257 contributions","phmbo1":"145 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - New Delhi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r518620101-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Be prepared for cancellations and delays","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Upon asking this was denied, everything was fine. When in the lounge we were kept waiting till some 18.00 hrs before it was announced that the flight had a delay of another 30 minutes.\n\nAfter some 45 minutes a member of the ground staff comes in and tells everyone of that flight on an individual basis that they need to bring in a spare part with the flight of 21.00 hrs. Replacing it will only take 30 minutes and then we'll be on our way... it was said...\n\nThe flight arrived as scheduled and apparently the part was delivered because it was announced that it would take some 45 minutes before we could board. However, after some one and a half hour the final announcement came that \"we regret that the service is cancelled\".\n\nThis is no fun of course but the worst part was yet to come. The KQ ladies who had to arrange hotel and shuttles for everyone was suddenly attacked by some 100 passengers and, boy oh boy, many of those were not friendly. It's amazing how people think they're the only ones and only their appointments are important. The lady was really trying to first find an extra KQ flight, then an alternative flight but some passengers wouldn't even let her finish her phone calls. It's really embarrassing how some people treated the KQ ground staff...\n\nI managed to get a hotel name out of her and didn't wait for the taxi. Was at the hotel at around 01.00 hrs and had myself put on one of the later flights of the next day. Got an upgrade to business.\n\nAll in all, not pleasant that the flight was cancelled but these things happen. What was worse were the other passengers. Kudos to the lady from KQ who kept here cool.

I have nothing particularly negative to say about the inflight business class service which was quite standard.  However my experience with their baggage handling was less than satisfactory.  Kenya Airways falls far short of their sky team partners’ in handling baggage issues.Upon arrival in Lagos, I discovered that my suit case was damaged.  After spending an hour to get to fill in a form and have the person in charge of baggage to witness the damage, I asked what the next step would be.   I was told that, as the manager would have to see the suitcase, I should return to the airport the next day to show it to him.   What!  I live over 50 km away from the airport and that would mean a 100 km only  return trip to \"show and tell\".......  I decided to wait at the airport until the manager was available - which meant another hour wait.   Over one hour later, I showed the case to the manager.  He told me to bring it back the next day! What! What! What!!! I explained that I had purposely waited to see him due to the problem of distance/Lagos traffic etc. and asked why he needed it the next day after seeing today.   He said for \"inspection and repairs\".  I asked him to have a Kenya airways staff to accompany me to my waiting vehicle where I would empty my suitcase and hand it over to their care.  He refused.  He also informed me that, if I could not return to the airport the next day myself, I could afford to send my driver to deposit the suitcase at the airport.I have sent a written complaint three times (incident  reference # 170724-000206 to Kenya Airways guest support  to obtain the their support.   They twice wrote to «sincerely apologise for the disappointment gained.» and both times referred me back to their Lagos office (which happens to be at the airport 100 km away/return trip) or simply ignored my email. Ironically, each time I was sent a feedback survey....  I tried the Kenya Airways 24 hour chatline - after being first in queue and  waiting for an agent for 20 minutes (three times), I gave up.Kenya Airways, \"the Pride of Africa\" is of the opinion that I can afford the stress, time and money to make a 200 km:  to drop my baggage for damage inspection then collect it after \"possible repairs\" otherwise I should repair or replace it myself.I have had baggage problems with other Sky Team partner airlines - which is inevitable since I travel a great deal - but they have always been resolved in a respectful and professional manner   as well as with consideration  and minimum discomfort on my side - I actually believe them when they refer to me as a \"valued customer\".   This is certainly not the case with Kenya Airways once one has a baggage problem.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0m0O","crvsd":"Momo O wrote a review Aug 2017","ui_header_link":"Momo O","default":"ACCRA","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"11 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Paris - Lagos","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r514642348-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"200 KM TRIP FOR BAGGAGE REPAIRS REQUIRED BY KQ","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We had a quick 1 hour 15 minute stop in Bangkok.\nThe flight to Bangkok was operated by a Bangkok based crew while there was a crew change at Bangkok.

There were 2 options and 2 meals were served in the flight.\nThe crew were not too warm and friendly and rushed you to make your choice for food and also you had to wait as you called for crew.\nWe flew on the 787-8 Dreamliner which is a very technologically advanced aircraft. The inflight entertainment was average with top films but also films which didn't seem too appealing.

We walk across entire airport. Kenyan airways woman at transfer desk says I have to pay $20 transit visa per person good for 72 hours to just to go pick up my bags at baggage claim and then drop them off at other terminal.  A disgusting scam by Kenya. She says only 1 of us should go to pay $20 instead of all 4 of us at $80 for transit visas she says. I ask her if I should go now and she says yes.  I go through passport control pay the $20 ransom, take my bags outside of the airport, walk down the street where cars are dropping people off as I push 4 bags weighing a total of 100 pounds plus in a cart 1/3 of a mile to this next terminal. I go into this terminal and re-check bags.  I get to the bag screening area where they scan your check in bags for bombs, etc. and 1 guy at the baggage screening conveyor who checks and X-Rays bags for under the plane is sleeping. No joke. He was asleep for the hour plus I was there. I enter the main check in hall at this terminal at 2am and the guy says they don't open the counter until 4am. Ar this point I am fuming. I tell them to hold my bags, he says he can't. I say to call the transfer desk and ask why the lady didn't tell me they didn't open untill 4am, he says he has no phone.  Meanwhile my wife and kids are wondering where I am thinking I was going to be like 10 minutes and it is going on 1 1/2 hours.  I finally get an employee to go back to their terminal and tell them what is happening. I finally check in bags at 3:45am and convince guy to print all our boarding passes even though my wife and the kids are not present but I have their passports. Now...2 weeks later, coming home. Fly back into Nairobi again. 8 hour layover so we pay for a lounge to sleep.  5am flight time.  I stand in line to talk to Kenyan Airways people at the transfer desk (30 min. in line and only 4 people ahead of me).  People there tell me to go to Turkish Airlines transfer desk at 2:30am. I do, no one is there. 3am, no one is there. 3:30, no one is there.  I have my lounge person keep calling first a supervisor, then a manager. They say they are sending someone. No one is showing and the flight time is approaching fast. I knew the ridiculous process shed of me of going through multiple security checks, going outside airport, etc. I finally say screw it and tell my wife and the kids to stay put. I go through passport control (only one guy is there who was sleeping, I had to wake him up).  This time they don't charge me $20.  Get bags at baggage claim, they have been just sitting there in the open for hours. Walk across street and now hundreds of people in line to check in at new terminal. Stand in line for an hour. Find out flight is delayed 2 hours by text message from United but of course no monitors in the airport show this delay.  They never do show it is delayed. I have to ask someone at the gate.  Add to the fact that every time you move from terminal to terminal or into the gate you have to go through metal detectors.  Worst experience of my life at an airport, and I have been to 20 countries.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O543SWdanp","crvsd":"Dan P wrote a review Aug 2017","ui_header_link":"Dan P","default":"Sacramento, CA","phmbo":"257 contributions","phmbo1":"161 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r508471952-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Jomo Kenyatta International Airport worst airport in world and Kenya Airlines clueless","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Luggage lost for 5 days (2 of us) and 9 days i.e. the whole trip (1 of us).\n\nThis was a disastrous start to the trip of a lifetime for my nieces and me. On arrival at Charles de Gaulle airport the info board was displaying 'delayed' only to change to 'cancelled' for our flight to Nairobi.\n\nThe airport staff didn't have a clue what to do with hundreds of people stranded - there was absolute chaos. No provision was made in terms of information or refreshments and we had to queue for 3 hours to be told our fate which (in our case) was to fly to The Seychelles overnight, spend 8 hours stranded there (not allowed out) and arrive in Nairobi the next evening.\n\nThen we were informed that our luggage was missing. We were given $100 each (which had to be changed to Kenyan shillings with commission charges) to buy clothes, shoes, toiletries, mosquito repellant, malaria medication etc etc. Didn't cover our expenses at all so we had to spend more money.\n\nThis resulted in losing 24 hours of our holiday and one night's prepaid 5* hotel accommodation in Nairobi.

Inflight personnel was professional, smart and friendly. The meals were typical airline and even good on return light (KQ792) .

We arrived at Muscat totally exhausted, filthy (without bathing), restless, wistful and a lot of regret of using Kenya Airways for our holiday.\n\nGenerally, your staff at the Dubai office and particularly the Station Manager Mr. Dennis Monari was absolutely ineffectual and noncommittal to our needs. Finally, it was the Dnata Connection Desk staff & Duty Supervisor appreciating our plight since 0615 hours took it onto themselves to get us confirmations on the Oman Air flight ETD 2250 hrs.\n\nIt has been a harrowing and tormenting experience for me and my wife all of 17 hours we spent at the Dubai T1 because of Kenya Airways inefficiency and lack of sensitivity.\n\nHaving braved the time, the least we expect from Kenya Airways now is a compensation for the Ordeal we went through for no fault of ours.

Kenya, Sweet waters, Lake Elmenteita and Masai Mara. The hospitality was excellent with amazing service of ever smiling people. We had formed an impression of Kenya being incredible with all our initial apprehensions put to rest until our debacle with Kenya Airways at Dubai.\n\nWe were eventually put on the Oman Air flight of 2250 hours after a 17 hours ordeal at the Dubai Airport. We arrived at Muscat totally exhausted, filthy (without bathing), restless, wistful and a lot of regret of using Kenya Airways for our holiday.\n\nGenerally, your staff at the Dubai office and particularly the Station Manager Mr. Dennis Monari was absolutely ineffectual and noncommittal to our needs. Finally, it was the Dnata Connection Desk staff & Duty Supervisor appreciating our plight since 0615 hours took it onto themselves to get us confirmations on the Oman Air flight ETD 2250 hrs.\n\nIt has been a harrowing and tormenting experience for me and my wife all of 17 hours we spent at the Dubai T1 because of Kenya Airways inefficiency and lack of sensitivity.\n\nHaving braved the time, the least we expect from Kenya Airways now is a compensation for the Ordeal we went through for no fault of ours. Though, this may not pay for the total discomfort and distress we have experienced but may lessen our pain and improve our impression about Kenya Airways as a whole.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597bhavanam","crvsd":"Bhavana M wrote a review Jul 2017","ui_header_link":"Bhavana M","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Muscat Governorate","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r498968742-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"17 hours of hopelessness","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Then again maybe no one at kenya airways actually cares how poor the African routes are.\n\nStrongly recommend not to fly Kenya Airways. Flight out of Nairobi was delayed by 4 hours with very little communication and passengers waiting to be told what's happening.\n\nFlight back from Harare was cancelled whilst at the airport. Put in the next flight which was 5 hours later, which was also delayed by another 3 hours blaming a lack of an engineer and paper work issues. The old tired Embraer don't have tvs that work. The air hostess did apologise though.\n\nAll in all a 8 hour delay, missed connections, missed meetings and kenya airways twitter handle saying sorry for the inconvenience caused. Am seeking compensation and will post how my recovery efforts go.\n\nThey need to get serious with their passengers and see that the reason for their demise is structural, passenger loads, faulty planes etc. Those of you who can fly alternative carriers please consider. When we were waiting for the cancellations and postponement ground staff mentioned that this is now becoming normal.

Being almost a monopolist in east-Africa makes that they sometimes give the impression they couldn't be bothered...\n\nAlthough they like to give the passenger the impression they're the best thing what could've happened to them, the service is average to poor, the food is very mediocre and the equipment needs (superficial) maintenance. Panels are loose, tray-tables are sagging. We can only hope that major structural maintenance is under control.\n\nThere's no consistency in their operations, sometimes you have to wait to get pulled to a gate upon arrival, sometimes they're allowed to taxi themselves to the bridge. Sometimes you get to a bridge at a gate, sometimes you need to bus back tot the terminal. They claim that's all due to external circumstances, but forcing the people to stay in their seats after engine shut-down 'cause stewardess needs to walk through the cabin to check the front door... take a leaf from other airlines and learn.\n\nFinally, the lounge.

It was absolutely packed with travellers continuing on to China. The window seat I had booked was already very full with a large lady conversing with her equally large friend in the middle seat.  I quickly decided not to argue with them and took the aisle seat, at least thinking that I would be able to move more freely during the night as there was no way I could have got past them without disturbing them. It was a lovely new aircraft but the seats are VERY close, even for economy.  I am extremely short (1.57m / 5'2\") and had to sleep with my legs bent up towards my nose rather than being able to fit my knees straight behind the seat in front of me :(Although the plane was new, my \"on-board entertainment\" was disobliging and wouldn't work, the food was absolutely inedible - mainly some kind of starch and overcooked veggies.

Later breakfast is served.....a choice of hot food is given as well as cereal, fruit, croissants and yogurt.  More drinks are offered and newspapers distributed.  Lunch is a choice of hot food, laid out on white starched table cloths.  Very tasty and so different from the offerings in economy.  Off the aircraft first and through the fast track at Immigration.

And, when I ordered red wine they gave me 2 bottles instead of just the standard one and they didn't open them like they often do, like they anticipate that you are going to leave the plane with it so they open it so you are more obligated to drink it on the plane. Kenya Airways did not do this. Even more remarkably, the wine was actually so good that I just wanted to drink both bottles.

I like to the day time flight on BA out of Heathrow  it gives us  a late evening in Nairobi . Alas, now at terminal 3, which in my view is the worst terminal  at Heathrow. And at nearly £1200 each for BA decided to give KQ business a try as they  were doing a deal for Business and internal flights, which we had 5 , 2 in Business . Reviews of KQ were not that positive on the various websites. However,  Check in, super smooth and fast track into the Lounge , which was very good and  set the tone for the flight. Staff,  Attentive and professional , none obtrusive  service through out  the night  flight. Day time flight back to Heathrow as was even better. Bar set up for self service on the flight after the main meal which should be the norm. Overall worth the extra money . Internal flights on KQ were good and apart from the Mombasa to Nairobi which was 40 minutes late, everything went well.  The Lounge in Nairobi  for out short flight  to Kisumu was good . The Lounge at Mombasa prior to the flight back to Jomo  is very poor. Food was appalling and cold . You have to pay for Wifi ( apart from the first 15 minutes, why bother. You have to pay for alcohol and a very nice  person spent 15 minutes seeking a Tusker for me, which was warm. Plenty of boxes on display which you can purchase and they will be microwaved for  you! . The Lounge at Jomo the next day prior to the flight to London was a little better. Although, we must have got there at the end of breakfast . Had to chase down staff for plates and cutlery   and food!. at least the Wifi was free! . Apart from the moans re the Lounges in Kenya I was impressed by the over all service from KQ and suspect that BA are not going to tempt me back in future flights to Kenya.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCM222","crvsd":"TCM222 wrote a review Jun 2017","ui_header_link":"TCM222","default":"Bourne, United Kingdom","phmbo":"35 contributions","phmbo1":"16 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r496076073-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Positive experince in Business","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I went to the airline service desk to find out what to do about it, I was met with a stony, nonchalant and dis-interested customer service agent who advised me that my suitcase had been scanned on to the plane and so it must be somewhere. She dispatched someone off in search and I waited about 30 minutes  but the suitcase was not to be found. I was given a piece of paper with a reference number and told to contact them the following day for an update. I asked if they could provide me with an emergency overnight kit and she said no! Thankfully the wonderful staff at the Villa Rosa Kempinski Hotel provided me with some emergency supplies, and kept chasing the airline the following day and my suitcase was finally located and arrived in on a flight at midnight the following day (30 hours later). Unfortunately the airline could not arrange to have the suitcase delivered to my hotel in time for me to check out the following day so I had to pay USD 50 to have it collected from the airport. I asked for this sum to be reimbursed and the airline refused. I pushed back and they said they would only refund me USD 30. I am still waiting for the refund and the flight was on April 5th! Will never fly with this airline again. The staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and completely disinterested in the fact that I was inconvenienced.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/61/79/c0/maireads2018.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maireads2018","crvsd":"Mairead S wrote a review Jun 2017","ui_header_link":"Mairead S","default":"Sydney, Australia","phmbo":"67 contributions","phmbo1":"44 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lagos - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r493269101-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Lost Luggage","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

No prior notice given, nothing on website indicating there was an issue and no explanation for the cancellation provided.  The support we received was wholly inadequate. One person, trying her best but obviously overwhelmed.  We were third in line when we arrived. We got to the front of the line after 20 minutes--and by this time a substantial line up had formed behind us.   We were told there was no way to get to Vic Falls that day, so we would have to fly to JNB, overnight and then travel the next day. Given we had booked into a safari lodge for that night, this cost us about $2000 ( party of 5).  we were told that ground staff in JNB would look after us and make all hotel and meal arrangements. It was probably another 15 minutes before our arrangements in Cape Town were finalized( no idea how long people behind has had to wait!) When we arrived in JNB, the staff there knew nothing about the cancellation and seemed to spend most of their time chatting with colleagues instead of helping customers.  On top of that they were rude.  I understand flights get delayed and even cancelled for circumstances beyond control of airlines.  No idea why our flight was cancelled, but Kenya Airways failed to properly notify us, failed to provide sufficient support in CPT to make arrangements for the passengers and failed to ensure staff in JNB were prepared to assist. My wife reminded me that the only other time she had a flight cancelled in Africa was also Kenya Airways.

After numerous phone calls and emails, absolutely nothing was done to locate this luggage and eventually the airline merely admitted that it was untraceable. None of our calls were ever returned, we received differing stories of the bag not being loaded first in Hanoi and then in Nairobi. It became quite obvious from the outset that the airline did not care about this problem and could not be bothered to help us.\n\nThe flight experience was unprofessional, tardy, and disrespectful towards the passengers. Traveling between Hanoi and Nairobi felt like the passengers were alone on the flight and when the air hostess staff were visible, they were sullen, impatient and obviously cared very little for the wellbeing and comfort of the passengers on board. Upon boarding the flight in Hanoi, we were not greeted by a single staff member. Passengers were sleeping in incorrect seats and no air hostess could be found to assist us. Food was served with an air of contempt and annoyance. The hot breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and fruit. Drinks were served once on the flight. Trays took more than an hour to be cleared. An all round ghastly experience hopefully not to ever be repeated.\n\nWe arrived home from an amazing honeymoon with a bitter taste in our mouths and one less bag.... Stay away - not worth the lower cost at all!!!!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/8c/ca/aa/jeremy-p.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/764jeremyp","crvsd":"Jeremy P wrote a review Apr 2017","ui_header_link":"Jeremy P","default":"","phmbo":"14 contributions","phmbo1":"10 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Hanoi - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r480109311-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Shocking experience - do not fly with them!!","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Landing in Amsterdam then was 10 minutes earlier than announced just 15 minutes ago, so cabin staff had to rush to get everybody properly seated and buckled up. Better communication from the flight deck would be in order.\n\nThe Dreamliner planes only have business (somewhat old-fashioned seats) and economy class (rather modern seats). No premium economy type option is available. A good headphone is handed out also in economy.\n\nService levels ok - in a country where the Masai are proud they can do without water for three days, one should perhaps not be surprised that not too many rounds of drinks are served.

This meant we missed our connecting international flight to Amsterdam at 7:55am.\n\nWhen speaking to the operator 'Wangare' we were told she would call us back. after waiting an hour still no call. so at 2:30 am we called again to be told 'just get to Nairobi and they will sort you out there'. After spending 2 hours waiting for answers in Nairobi we were told we were booked on the flight the next day. They did offer us a hotel but we have friends in Nairobi so we stayed with them. We were assured our taxi fare would be reimbursed. No surprises that this was later refused.\n\nWe were travelling as a family and they had split us all up, luckily the kind air hostesses managed to swap some people around and sit us together.\n\nThe plane was cramped and the entertainment limited. the 'continental breakfast' consisted of a packet of nuts and some juice. There was pee on the bathroom floor, when I asked for a blanket for my sleeping baby I was told they were for business class only, and when I asked for some milk... the flight attendant forgot.\n\nThe service was slow, unsympathetic and inefficient. Considering all the mistakes they made, it seemed like it was up to us to fix them ourselves.\n\nDespite being 'checked in' by Kenya airways to our final destination in Stockhom, when we reached Amsterdam the KLM flight had no knowledge of us and we had to explain the situation to them. They then reprimanded us for not having checked ourselves in properly!\n\nAll in all, what should have been a straightforward 11 hour journey, ended up taking... from 1:30 am monday 24th... to 8pm on tuesday 25th. 43 hours later.

Planes are comfortable with good legroom, few turbulence and fewer flight disconnections. Flight attendants are pleasant and approachable and they attend to enquiries promptly. Worthy of mention is their propensity to assist passengers in every way possible, before, during and after one's flight. For example, I twitted the airline about my apprehension that I may not be allowed to fly back with them as my new passport had no South African permanent resident permit inside, they communicated this, with my documents to their Lagos office beforehand, and my return journey was thus without problem.

At the time of booking and also at check-in, my baggage, two suitcases, were booked directly to Goa. However, in Mumbai, I discovered that my luggage had been offloaded in Mumbai, thus requiring my checking-in again in Mumbai. At this point, I discovered that both my suitcases had their zipper pulls cut, obviously with cutters and the locks that I had used discarded in the process. This action has now rendered both my suitcases useless for further use.  While I appreciate that customs may wish to check passengers' baggage, I find it appalling that this is done by damaging passengers' suitcases, and not in the presence of passengers. Fortunately, nothing went missing in my suitcases, although they had been thoroughly rifled through and a gift that I had wrapped had the wrapping damaged. If this has been done by Jet Airways, it is still the ultimate responsibility of Kenya Airways to inform its passengers about formalities undertaken in Mumbai by Jet Airways and to take responsibility for passengers' baggage.  I would not recommend the Jet Airways connection but also feel that Kenya Airways needs to do a lot more towards customer satisfaction. Similarly,  if this damage was done in Kenya, then Kenya Airways owes me an explanation.The return flight to Nairobi was hardly impressive, with the cabin crew who appeared to be in a hurry to chat away in the galley rather than to serve passengers. Dinner trays were not taken away for a long time,  prompting several passengers to take their own trays back to the galley. Blankets were issued to passengers at random  rather than being placed on every passenger's seat. All in all, KQ certainly needs to improve on many fronts.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylviaf622","crvsd":"Sylvia F wrote a review Apr 2017","ui_header_link":"Sylvia F","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"14 contributions","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Goa","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r478282875-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Damaged baggage","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Found Kenya Airways to be competitively priced, and the Cargo staff in Bangkok did an amazing job with giving us information about animal travel protocols e.g. import/export permits etc. Cargo staff also picked up the animal in Bangkok.\n\nUnfortunately, the regulations of Kenya Airways (unlike European airlines) does not permit the animal to be taken out of the cage to be fed or walked while in transit, which led to our dog being confined in his cage for 30 hours without a chance to relieve himself. Had we known this prior to discovering it on destination we would not have booked. This is animal torture. Thankfully the ground staff in Freetown met me as I excited the aircraft and then facilitated to get the dog out in less than 10 minutes.\n\nFlying with other airlines, the animal is customarily taken out, walked and checked by veterinarian.\n\nOther than the dog incident the airline did not impress -Old aircrafts; bad food and substandard in flight service.\n\nAs a comparison we paid 1700$ for the dog ticket to Thailand-Africa with Kenya Airways, while we paid 700$ to return him to Thailand from Africa via Europe with other carriers.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/77/52/b4/araaf.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARaaf","crvsd":"ARaaf wrote a review Mar 2017","ui_header_link":"ARaaf","default":"Thailand","phmbo":"126 contributions","phmbo1":"56 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Freetown","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r467970269-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Torture Pet Travel from Asia to Africa","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Firstly an earlier departure time was posted on the boards in the terminal (luckily I had a long transit so was unaffected) but this later changed to the original time and then a 40 minute delay. We boarded as if we were to depart at the new time and spent close to two hours on board with little information, just that we were waiting for passengers from a connecting flight.

The second and last time I fly - the cabin crew ignored my repeated requests to lower the cabin temperature of my row 14 - then told me it would take too much time to cool the cabin - with hours remaining in the flight. I sweat the entire flight - it was like a furnace. To make matters worse, they would not bring me bottled water but offered me tap water - which I have been warned against drinking by other stewards of the airline industry. The flight attendant rolled his eyes when I asked for a second glass of water I did not want to ingest - because it may be polluted or contaminated. He told me to wait until food service. EVERY TIME I went to the back of the plane, the flight attendants were eating the food from the cart or were asleep in their seats - folded over. This was for an 8 hour flight! I suffered further because the woman behind me was coughing and sneezing and there was no ventilation to push her germs away. I have been sick with the flu for a week after my hellacious flight. WHEN I BOOK KLM, I EXPECT TO FLY ON KLM - NOT THIS EXCUSE FOR AN AIRLINE THAT IS FACING IT'S OWN INTERNAL PROBLEMS DUE TO THEFT BY THE PRINCIPALS of the company. I will suggest they be removed from the SkyTeam Alliance and will gladly see them fold. I, of course don't expect any apology or restitution for the $500 spent on this miserable experience.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7737YUadamd","crvsd":"adam d wrote a review Mar 2017","ui_header_link":"adam d","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Amsterdam","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r463925394-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Unimagineable!","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

To start with, booking the flight was a roller coaster. Prices kept changing, from the time they received a quotation to the time of payment. The price drastically went up all in a space of less than one month. Top that, their flight was delayed and no reason was given.\n\nThe major problem was when they arrived back in Lilongwe (on a Wednesday), they discovered that all of my Mother's luggage was missing. After reporting the matter to the officials, they were only able to trace one of the bags which was apparently left in Mozambique. This bag reached Lilongwe on Saturday and lucky enough it was protected in plastic wrap. After inquiring for the other bag they kept telling her it can not be traced and to call back the next day. On Saturday, they still could not trace it and assumed it was in Mozambique as well, they tried reaching out to the colleagues in Mozambique but were told to wait till Monday so that they can check in case the bags was with customs.\nThe bag was located and for some reasons best known to themselves, they sent the bag to Nairobi (VIA MALAWI) and Nairobi had to send it back to Malawi. By then this Tuesday. If the bag fiasco wasn't enough, when the bag arrived, my sister noticed that the bag weighed much less than before. They opened the bag only to find that EVERYTHING that was NEW - Every single Item that was bought on their trip - had been stolen. A couple thousand USD worth of items all stolen. My sister completed a compensation form, so we will wait to see how that goes.\n\nI feel very disappointed and sad for my mother, who went for a critical medical checkup to have undergone such tremendous stress with this airline.\nA number of my friends have complained about Kenya Airways - from delayed flights not only for hours but days which ended up with them missing their connecting flights, to rude flight attendants, baggage missing as well as theft of items from customers bags. And one sad thing was that when my sister went to collect the first bag on Saturday, she met a guy who was from Gambia, His luggage also went missing on a Kenya airways flight. He came to Malawi for a one week conference and unfortunately all his stuff were in the missing bag and the only items he had were the clothes he had on that day and a very small hand luggage.\n\nFrom my mothers experience and what I have heard from friends, I wouldn't recommend Kenya airways to my worst enemy. It is a complete mockery to other airlines and very incompetent.\n\nTo Kenya Airways, your services are beyond dismal and disgraceful! You should run a matatu bus service, not an international airline.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahBen1","crvsd":"Leah Ben wrote a review Mar 2017","ui_header_link":"Leah Ben","default":"Lilongwe, Malawi","phmbo":"8 contributions","phmbo1":"20 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Mumbai - Lilongwe","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r463655096-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Terribly Worst Airline to Ever Exist on earth","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

He did this online where he had to state the childrens names and ages (16 & 13)and the ticket confirmation came through. When the tickets were forwarded to me I sent an email to KENYA AIRWAYS asking if the children could go as unaccompanied minors, and my ex also emailed KENYA AIRWAYS.\nWe heard nothing back from the airline so when I went to check the kids in today I asked if they could go as unaccompanied minors, I was told to go to their office, which I did I was told that the cost for this is $100.00 per child one way, total there and back $400.00. I said that there was no ways I was paying for that and I am sure my kids will be fine. AT NO POINT DID SHE TELL ME THAT MY KIDS COULD NOT GO ON THE FLIGHT UNLESS THE MONEY WAS PAID.\nI went checked the kids in and sent them through Customs once they got through my daughter messaged to say they were seated in the lounge, and I left and came back to work. I then got a panic message from my daughter telling me that they are allowing her on the plane but not her brother as he is a minor and unless the money is paid he cannot go on the flight.\nI then spoke to the lady who I had dealt with and she said that she told me to pay but I had said that I wasn’t, which is correct, she never said they cant go on the flight if I don’t pay and surely if we had booked the tickets Kenya airways would had come back to say children aren’t allowed on their own.\nLucky my daughter had money to pay as it was 15 minutes before the flight was leaving that this all started. This has traumatized my children and they were faced to deal with this unprofessional behavior. My children have flown to Dar Es Salaam before on a different airline and there was never an issue like this.

Not a good choice on my part.\nWhere to start? Well, maybe in Dubai. I have to say that the check in there was about the best part of the whole experience. It was frustrating as the boarding counters only opened 3 hours before expected departure, and by that time there was a large and rather confused gathering of potential passengers, without a Kenya Airways staff member in sight.\nKenya Airways, as with other airlines that have online check-in, will need to establish a better system for dealing with bag-drop customers, as the line and waiting time for bag-drop was longer and moved slower than the standard check-in queue.\nThe whole process was redeemed by a very efficient and friendly lady on the check-in counters. she smiled at everyone and was incredibly helpful. Kudos to her, she was the best staff member I encountered on the entire return trip.\nI guess I should have also known that traveling on a 737 to Nairobi, and then again to Johannesburg was going to be a challenge. The Kenyan Airways 737-800's I flew on are not really adequately equipped for a 5 hour flight\nThe seats were close together, and not very comfortable. On-board entertainment was adequate, but the headphones are antiquated and require passengers to attempt themselves to put on felt covers, which are not the easiest things to handle. Especially first thing in the morning. My mood wasn't helped by having to get up a few times before we even took off to allow the people seated next to me to move, as they had sat in the wrong seats.\nI was also shocked when the cabin announcement came over that we should remain vigilant and keep an eye on our hand luggage as there may be theft on the plane.\nThe flight itself was OK, with reasonably palatable food. The lady who eventually sat next to me sadly decided to spread herself out too, making my experience even worse.\nThe changeover at Nairobi was also poorly handled. Jomo Kenyatta airport can have all the upgrades it likes, but the ground staff's incompetence is not dealt with they can expect worse reviews. The initial departure gate was changed, and the announcement over the PA was unintelligible, The television displays were also not changed to show the new gate. it turned out that the PA announcement was also wrong. Eventually we all got on board though.\nThe flight to Johannesburg was equally uncomfortable, made even worse by the most awful meal I think I have ever been served on an international flight. The beef was one large blob of gristle. Yuk. The flying itself was smooth, I can give some credit to the pilots.\nThe return trip on 7th January was better only by virtue of it being on a brand spanking new 787. I arrived at check in early, and I was glad that I did. I am still not sure that I understand what happened. I had one suitcase weighing 27kg, and a hand luggage bag of approximately 8kg. The luggage allowance for economy class passengers is two bags of 23kg. For business class it is 2 bags of 32Kg.\nI had one bag, but because it weighed 27Kg, I was asked to empty out 4Kg into my hand luggage. If I could only have one suitcase at 23Kg then I understand. I was 19Kg under my total weight limit, and the 27Kg suitcase was not a handling issue, as Kenya Airways accepts 32Kg cases from business class customers. Please be warned future economy class flyers. The big thing for me was not even having to unpack and repack, but the joy that it seemed to bring to the ground staff who were instructing me.\nSo to Nairobi, where once again I witnessed a display of incompetence so obvious it was painful. Firstly we were delayed in leaving by over an hour. passengers were asked to go to the departure lounge as if the flight was on time. This lounge started filling up. No announcements were made at all informing us of the reason for the delay or that there was a delay. this is very poor. Then the coup de grace. The ground staff member who is now responsible for allowing passengers on to the flight (bearing in mind that all passengers had been screened at the door to the lounge) decides in his infinite wisdom to open the doors to the airbridge.\nPassengers then got up and formed a crush at the open door, where they were then told through a raised and panicked voice that the plane was boarding by zone and that everyone should remain seated. That was not going to happen. It was bizarre to see business class passengers and families squeezing through an irritated crowd.

I asked to change my seat as have a bad shoulder and was told no without even looking. Other people who went to ask after me had their seats changed. I was sat in a middle seat and was almost set upon to change my seat by a woman who wanted to sit with her husband for the 8 1/2 hour flight. The entertainment was so old Casablanca in black and white. Food was very poor and as a night flight attendants were no where to be seen. Breakfast was a croissant (small) and a plain yogurt which was not very nice. On way back I was starving flying out at 3am we ended up leaving at 2am 1 hour earlier with no notice and for the 2 1/2 hour flight from Zanzibar to Nairobi was only given a small croissant and yogurt no water. I then had 5 hours wait at Nairobi which is so confusing finding the gate as they kept changing the gate number. Again food was small and poor I was given two meals which was breakfast of a few potatoes spinach and sausage the bread roll was stale and plain yogurt which was not nice no water. The second meal lunch was beef with noodles which was child size salad small a piece of cake which was tasteless again no water. When asking for water you would only get a small cup. I was starving and asked for snacks which was two small packets of nuts. Upon landing I felt dizzy and have trouble walking as felt faint been to GP and told I was severely dehydrated.

We arrived in Nairobi on a red-eye from Gaborone for our connection to Abidjan, and it was delayed. Ok, no problem. We finally go to board, and we are told that we don't have seats now, because they had to change planes, and we were supposed to magically know this (no announcements made) and go see the desk to get new seats.\n\nWe go to the desk and are not given any information, pushed around, then told that they are re-routing us as our flight is boarding. They tell us that we have to stay in Nairobi overnight, then fly out in the morning. Well, we aren't allowed to be in Nairobi, so that doesn't work. Then after much insisting, they come up with a solution. We are told to fly to Addis Ababa, find the Kenya Airways desk, and they will put us up in a hotel overnight so we can get a flight home in the morning (there's a groups of 8 of us by the way). Well, we get to Addis, and are given the run around for hours. No Kenya airways desk, no hotel, no sympathy from the Ethiopian Airlines staff. We ended up sleeping in the Addis Ababa airport overnight because it doesn't close, then flying home. We are now Sheba Miles members, and avoid Kenya airways at all costs.\n\nI understand that Nairobi only has one run way and a bunch of problems (staff protests, etc). However, your customer service is horrid.\n\nOh, and even for airline food, the food on these flights is horrible.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/0d/bb/88/cassie-g.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotATravelNewbie","crvsd":"Jade W wrote a review Jan 2017","ui_header_link":"Jade W","default":"Washington DC, District of Columbia","phmbo":"74 contributions","phmbo1":"24 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Gaborone - Abidjan","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r455605856-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Struggilng Skyteam member","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Suffering from traffic problem when I arrived the airport, only about 1 hour left. However, the service counter was closed and the staff told me I could not check in my baggage and I have to reschedule my flight. One of staff claim that we can still get on the flight without baggage and asked me to find the Kenya Airways service counter. When I arrived the counter, the staff told me I can no longer get on the flight even without baggage. I was shocked and confused by what the staff told me. The flight would take off at 1510 and I was there in the service counter at 1425, I totally have enough time to reach the flight while they refused to help. This is totally unreasonable for me.\n\nTo avoid trouble and more payment, I couldn't but to ask for a rearrangement of flight while the flight could only be as soon as 2 days later. I was thankful that Ms UNGSUMALYN from Kenya Airway kindly helping me with the payment and reschedule.\n\nHowever, I was totally disappointed when the other day I was taking KQ860 back to HK, the flight finish boarding at 1500. Comparing to my previous arriving time of about 1 hour, they totally could have given me a hand with that but they refuse to give a hand. Due to tight schedule, one of my friend need to buy another flight ticket, and the other friend and I were stuck there in Bangkok and rushing to find hotel to overcome that two days.\nBefore taking Kenya Airways, I was really expecting that.

Every week newspaper articles and reports come out here in Kenya, saying they are pretty much bankrupt, pilots are striking, ground crew that don't show up to work and corruption allegations.\n\nSome examples of my latest experience with Kenya Airways:\n- flying from RSA to Kenya, we were on the 6pm flight on a Saturday. When we got to the terminal, a lot of tired-looking people and angry faces were there already. KQ had decided to cancel the morning and midday flights and push everyone onto the evening flight.\n- flying to and from Zanzibar, we got the chance to upgrade our tickets to business class at an extra cost. We thought it would be worth it. First it took about 5 calls to the call centre in order to finally get our new e-ticket, then there was an issue with the ticket of our baby not being included and on the way back, it took the KQ representative until an hour before take-off to show up and sort out our seats as there was \"a problem with sequencing\"\n\nI did have some good experience with KQ in cooperation with KLM, flying to Amsterdam. But if I can avoid it, I will not book any more flights with them.\n\nAnother tip: don't buy the cheapest ticket, buy the 2nd cheapest at the minimum (regular economy). Otherwise they put you on a waiting list and you won't be sure of a seat on the flight of your choice.","Image":"","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swinkey9","crvsd":"Angela S wrote a review Dec 2016","ui_header_link":"Angela S","default":"Galu Beach, Kenya","phmbo":"29 contributions","phmbo1":"12 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r445032857-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"The Shame of Africa","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At O R Thambo, the staff who worked at the check in desks of Kenya Airways were rude, unfriendly and entirely not reflective of the 'pride of 'Africa'. They should be embarrassed by their attitudes. Nevertheless we boarded the plane, landed in Nairobi for our transit to zanzibar.\n\nThe airport was not good. Our connecting flight details were not posted on the screen and no one could guide us where to go. Eventually someone told us to walk towards the correct gate. Once we got there, I encountered a kenya airways staff member by the name of Maureen who was absolutely and shockingly appalling at her service. (She worked at the precision air check in desk on the 06 Dec at about 08:00am) She honestly was the rudest and most unfriendly person- she would barely even answer the questions people asked her appropriately and could not be bothered at all. If she doesn't want to work there then please employ someone who does.. someone who will do a better job.\n\nOn the way back from zanzibar, the flight services and air hostesses and check in staff were much much nicer. We came back to johannesburg on a new plane (just over a year old). It was clean and lovely, and the staff were accommodating. Was very impressed with Kenya Airways on the way back to johannesburg.\n\nIt seems as though your services range from extreme good to extreme bad with no middle ground... something you need to work on!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeeraR116","crvsd":"Meera R wrote a review Dec 2016","ui_header_link":"Meera R","default":"South Africa","phmbo":"105 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r444449247-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Its not good it's not bad.

Having said all that i must add they are one of my preferred airlines, however i must rate the airline very poorly when it comes to the Nairobi to Accra and return trips. This is a route that i regularly travel and it is not one that i look forward to. As a rule Kenyan Airways staff are very courteous, polite and very helpful. Unfortunately i must say that in the last few months i have encountered some very rude and unhelpful staff on this route (both ways). It is quite a long (5 hour) trip and not the most enjoyable since Kenya Airways use probably their oldest 737's on this specific route which do not offer nice comfortable seating as in other models and there are no personal screens to watch your own choice in movies so you cannot sleep due to uncomfortable seating and you cannot watch a movie to get the time by. The onboard staff on these trips did not help in making it easier. I have personally experienced and have also witnessed other travelers experience some rude behavior when requesting something to drink or other assistance during the flight. Once the meals are served and everything cleared they rush to enclose themselves behind their curtains and if anyone requests some assistance  after this it is as if they are doing everyone a huge favor by assisting and not the type of behavior we were expecting from professional staff. On other (Shorter) routes they will always come at regular intervals with water and juice and will always be at hand to assist with a smile. I don't understand what is different on this route but it is not a pleasant experience.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/5b/d8/c0/koosb.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koosb","crvsd":"Koosb wrote a review Dec 2016","ui_header_link":"Koosb","default":"Karen, Kenya","phmbo":"80 contributions","phmbo1":"22 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Accra - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r442082552-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Nairobi to Accra return trip","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I selected this route based on the listed times from the airline about the route.\n\nThe first day, the flight was cancelled after we had been kept waiting 2.5 hours after expected departure time. Reportedly due to technical issues. We were told to return the next day at the same time. I returned the next day and again we were delayed about an hour before the plane finally took off.\nOn boarding the plane, it was obvious this was not a route that was cared about because the plane was so unkempt and had obvious missing internal pieces, carpet was dirty and so on.\nThe layover went much more smoothly and the plane from NBO to DXB was brand new... smell a rat yet?\nAnyway, I missed one day of the conference due to this ... KQ apologized via a comment I'd made on twitter and I was hopeful for the flight back.\n\nEarly morning flight out of DXB was again delayed... Pilot said they had been late so missed departure window. Well, that meant again I missed connection in NBO. The only option was to wait till 6.25pm for another flight... this was at 7:50 in the morning. I was offered a hotel in town which I declined.\n\nI insisted on getting out earlier and a staff member promised to book me on a different airline after first telling me that my class of ticket was not eligible for re-booking on other airlines!\n\nI was given false hope however, as there was a staff switch and apparently someone didn't get an email they were supposed to have.\nI ended up spending the entire day at the airport. The staff member on Twitter had the nerve to tell me that delays happen for the \"safety\" of their passengers which might have been okay if we didn't already know that the delays were not safety related, but also not what to say to an already frustrated customer.\n\nThe entire day in the lounge, flights were announced as delayed for various routes. One lady missed her Godson's wedding, and so on.\n\nThe only folks that exhibited some remorse and actually tried to help were the front desk personnel at the lounge... one lady named Florence and some guy named Derrick who even if they were lying, went about seemingly caring for customers.\n\nTo top it off, they had a prompt for customers to take a survey recommending them as best airline for 2016! Talk about being blind to self!\n\nI would rather take a connecting flight with a more reliable airline than fly with Kenya Airways again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjsmart","crvsd":"tjsmart wrote a review Nov 2016","ui_header_link":"tjsmart","default":"Mountain View, California","phmbo":"106 contributions","phmbo1":"57 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lagos - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r439864557-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Equipment discrimination on routes plus consistently late departures","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Some flights changed 4 times since booking. You turn up at airport for a 3.20 flight, to be told it has been cancelled til 1am in the morning. they load you and 30 other disgruntled passengers onto a bus with all luggage, take you to a hotel for 5 hrs, you dont sleep as it is afternoon. load you back on the bus to go back to the airport, and they have dismissed all but one staff check-in lady, who has to process 30+ people for the flight. then you have another destination to Hararre, Zimbabwe, to go to where you sit on the tarmac for 45min while some get off and some get on, then off to Nairobi, where you have to wait 2 hrs till connecting flight is ready, which takes you to somewhere else before you get to Dar es Salam. and this is/ was with EVERY flight we had with Kenya Air, Never Again will i travel with them.

No apology from captain.\n\nWe had a connecting flight, also with Kenya Airways. We asked repeatedly if the flight would wait or if there was an alternative if we missed the connection. Again, communication was confused and incorrect. The staff did not take responsibility for their mess.\n\nWe were told we would be met by staff at transfers. No one there. We ran to the gates to see if we could make it. The flight had left. We eventually found the desk. More misinformation, but the staff did book us the next flight and a hotel for the few hours we needed to wait.\n\nSuch an arduous process, one desk after another. We finally get through and get our voucher. Bus takes ages to get to hotel (they choose the Weston, which is over half an hour away).\n\nBad service continues as bus takes ages to leave hotel when we are due to depart.\n\nThis is SUCH basic stuff. Unacceptable service.

Cannot complain & it's plane food and not restaurant style after all.\nDrinks available, and water when asked although provided in small plastic cup - one sip and all gone.\nAppreciate costs although providing a bottle of water would be better.\nHeathrow to Nairobi flight left at 17.55. Meal in the evening then early breakfast.\nNairobi to Heathrow left at 09.25.\nMeal breakfast then lunch.\n\n190 - small snack I.e. tea/coffee and croissant. Fine for journey between 45mins to 1 hr.

Not only did we find most ground staff unfriendly and not being very helpful, it continued on the plane as well. Our flight was over an hour delayed (although it was displayed with 25min only)  which made us worry if we would catch the connecting flight from Nairobi to Bkk. We already asked at check in where we've been told 'you will make it, don't worry' - ok! As the flight departure got later and later, we asked the flight attendant again on board to hear that only the captain would get information about the connecting flight before landing... Still we didn't hear any updates. After asking again, as we just were about to land 20 min before departure time of our  next flight, we looked into an annoyed face of our stewardess. Okayyy... We entered Nairobi Airport, running to our gate amongst other passengers who tried to catch the flight after not getting any replies from any staff we asked, we see the gate is closed, to see our flight departing without us 10min later. From inside the airport! They made us wait for the first flight and then can't manage within their own company to make a machine wait for 15 more minutes?! The worst let down was how the situation was handled after by the ignorant, unfriendly and clueless staff. Around 50 angry passengers were waiting for hours without proper info what would happen now. We've been rescheduled to a flight 24 hours later!! Without our luggage we've been brought to a hotel which actually sucked too as nothing there was in working order. Thanks for making us waste a day of our holidays in an awful place  without any fresh clothes.

When I finally met them on the terminal (not in an office or something, just on the way somewhere), they told me everything is okay and that I should come only 1.5 hour before my flight and they know it's weird but this how it works.

As the time for the flight approached there was no boarding info. The time for the flight came and went and still no information. Not one representative from Kenya Airways was to be found. Slowly all outlets closed and still no word. I called KLM in Amsterdam to find out what was happening and was told the flight was cancelled and that I was booked on a flight the next morning with a connection (via Nairobi) to Johannesburg. No hotel was offered and people were sleeping on the stone floor in front of the gate. Families with children etc. Morning came and I still hadn't seen anyone from Kenya Airways and there was no announcement or boarding call. Again I called KLM in Amsterdam (partner airline and I am gold member with them), I was told the flight was delayed by three hours. I now kind of knew that I would miss my connecting flight in Nairobi. When I finally boarded the flight it was packed and I was squeezed between two very large women (not their fault and I didn't complain but suffered in silence). Sure enough, I had missed the flight to Johannesburg and was offered a hotel for the night. Except I had no visa for Kenya and had to line up to get one through KQ, which took over and hour and a half. I then had to exit the airside part of the airport through passport control which took another hour and a half. After that, I had to line up to get the hotel voucher, which took another hour. I then had to sit on a bus for an hour to wait for the other passengers who were in the same boat. When I finally arrived at the hotel it was 2am in the morning and the hotel pickup was at 4am, so I basically got one hour of sleep. Thankfully the last flight was on time and I got a nice aisle seat. I didn't eat any of the food because I know it is terrible from previous flights with Kenya airways and I arrived in Johannesburg more than 36 hours late with no apology for KQ. The flight attendants were indifferent and not about to take ownership of anything. I travel for work and will do everything I can to avoid KQ in the future.

When they cancelled our flight out of Tanzania, which made us miss our next two connecting flights to South Africa, we knew it’s going to be a long night.

Then we missed our flight from Cape Town from Johannesburg because they didn’t rebook our connecting tickets properly either, so we ended up bumming around a sketchy terminal from midnight until 9am until their office was open to resolve the issue.\n\nCherry on top – they lost my luggage along the way, which put a huge damper on the rest of our trip.\n\nThis was our first time flying with Kenya Airways, and it will be our last.

The service was excellent with cheerful and upbeat flight attendants and above average food.  Unfortunately Kenya Airways is following the practice of many other airlines, they are putting 9 seats across in a plane designed for 8 across, the B787 Dreamliner.  It's a nice aircraft with interesting new features, but what good are bigger windows and fancy electronic dimmers if you feel terribly crammed in with constant shoulder contact with your neighbour because of the too narrow seats?

The flight attendant came through the cabin twice offering drinks only with the meals (which were inedible).  Most airlines offer bottles of water - this airline gives these cheap 200ml cups of water.  There were also no snacks offered between the meal services on the flight.

There are too many rumours of poor servicing, maintenance staff being poached by Middle Eastern airlines, cash flow problems and planes stranded (witnessed a brand new KQ Dreamliner stuck in Hanoi, Vietnam for 3 days last month due to parts - brand new!). Second concern is the exorbitant ticket prices, which just don't match with neither the service nor competition.","Image":"","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psieyes","crvsd":"psieyes wrote a review Oct 2016","ui_header_link":"psieyes","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"21 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Hanoi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r429654080-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Not at the standard they should be at","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The meals are good but do not cater for a diabetic as meal would have a starch and meat/chicken/fish plus a potato salad and a pudding and a white bread roll. No sugar free drinks available on the plane either. No pre selection of meals on booking and the web site did not allow us to check in from the Seychelles at all.

Getting through the check in process was quick and easy - the guy at the business counter was friendly and efficient. He effortlessly changed my seat from the 1st row to the second to give me some more legroom. The ensuing chaos to navigate through passport and security control can not be blamed on Kenya Airways. At least I could recover with gin and tonic in the lounge which was bright, clean and relatively quiet.\n\nThis flight itself, however did not get off to a good start. Boarding was a disaster. Vague attempts were made to call business class passengers earlier than the rest but this was totally chaotic and meant that I was one of the last to board in the business area and there appeared to be absolutely no space left for my hand luggage. I just dumped it in front of me and waited for the cabin staff to arrange something for me which they did.\n\nThis was an overnight flight and the business class seats, whilst being bigger than in economy, only reclined a little - a joke for such a long, 6 hour flight when a chance to sleep should be expected.\n\nAt least we were offered a variety of drinks before take off. I certainly needed a glass of champagne.\n\nPretty soon into the flight I got my pre-ordered gin and tonic just a few minutes ahead of my meal - an \"exotic\" salad presumably so named because there were some pineapple pieces added for good measure. I chose a main course comprising beef strips, rice, carrots and spinach. This was quite spicy. The accompanying Shiraz red wine from an indeterminate country was OK.\n\nEntertainment on this long flight comprised a film on the small screens emerging from the bulkhead which was laughable. I gave up and listened to my music on my smartphone.\n\nMost of the rest of the flight was in pure darkness. I tried sleeping but it was impossible with the seats provided. I was so grateful that the pilot was able to catch up on a late take off.\n\nSorry to be so negative but the tickets for business class are not cheap. And other airlines have understood how to make such journeys much more comfortable. The one saving grace was the patience and constant smile on the lips of the cabin crew.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/03/47/ea/eyekaytoo.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eyekaytoo","crvsd":"Eyekaytoo wrote a review Oct 2016","ui_header_link":"Eyekaytoo","default":"Leverkusen, Germany","phmbo":"2437 contributions","phmbo1":"701 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Abidjan - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r428484731-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Full, uncomfortable overnight flight - the cabin crew did their best...","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Their cabin crews are the worst ever, blunt, never smiling and unwelcoming, unless of course you travel BC which I have done as well with them and still my opinion won't change. Why is it that the airlines in any country in this world are the most expensive to get out of the country you are resident in and KA are one of them, SAA another and only to add BA into the mix. KA are almost on the bones of their backside and I know why as well, because their staff are the most un-cooperative of any airline I have flown with.

They're always late at take off but the majority of airlines are too yet they keep you sitting for an age before they get the call to take off.

Unfortunately, more than 1/3 of our trip ended up being spent in transit. I am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the Kenya Airway agents in the Nairobi airport. Not only did they ruin a large portion of our vacation and cost us money, but from a business standpoint their inability to manage situations is proving costly to Kenya Airlines as well. I love flying with Skyteam and all their affiliates, specifically Delta and Air France, but my experience with Kenya Airlines has been a disappointment and does not meet the expected standards. We began our experience with Kenya Airways waiting on our flight to Zanzibar where we were to arrive at 8:10 am. There were five of us and together we were paying more than $1000 a night for an all-inclusive resort in Nungwi. The first flight to Nairobi was more than an hour late. I regret not checking Kenya Airlines performance rating for this flight prior to booking since it shows they have a \"poor - 1 out of 5 stars\" rating and are only on time 62% of the time. When we arrived in Nairobi we immediately went to the Kenyan Airlines counter, knowing we had missed our connection. The attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into Zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning. We had asked if there were any other airlines they could check and put us on since we were able to find a few online. They continued to tell us no, they could not put us on any other airlines and there was nothing available with them. This was a lie and quite frankly, the people at the desk were not even looking for other options. They were content with simply doing the minimal amount of work, checking their cell phones while we were talking, and getting us away from their desk as their attitudes conveyed that we were annoying them simply by being inquisitive. After a bit of back and forth where we were not getting anywhere with the desk attendant we went to breakfast then downstairs to another Kenya Airlines desk. That was where we met Weddy - the most professional and helpful employee we have ever encountered with Kenya Airlines. We explained our predicament and she searched for alternative options, finding a flight leaving that evening with Precision Air (the same airline we had on our return flight that we booked directly through Kenya Airlines) and though we would still spend more than 12 hours in the airport, it would get us into Zanzibar about 11 p.m. Weddy had a long queue lined up and asked us to return in about an hour so she could work on the ticket after she sent some emails and verified the details.\nAdditionally, Weddy was the only person in the entire airport that understood what a queue was and managed to keep people actually in line and do her job in a proficient manner. The ability to keep people in a queue seemed lost on all your other employees as we would stand in line and random people would forgo the line walking straight up to the desk and the attendants would help them. When we returned later Weddy was able to get us the tickets - we still did not get to our hotel until almost midnight and lost that complete day, our excursion, and our all-inclusive amenities we paid for, but at least Weddy made the attempt to help us fix the issue and was courteous when doing so, unlike your other employees. But that was just the initial flight to Zanzibar - the return flight experience was worst.\n\nWhen leaving the airport from Zanzibar Sept 4 the personnel at the counter (Precision Air) would not print both our boarding passes, even though we received both our passes on the way in a couple days prior. They told us we had to get them at the desk in Nairobi. We had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets. Of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored the it and walked right up to the desk - which the Kenya Airline employees did not seem to care about and simply helped whomever was in front of them. And by helped I mean again spent the majority of the time talking on their cell phones or texting people in the middle of a customer's complaint/issue. Two of our group attempted to get their passes printed off at the Kiosk but were unable (probably because we were within the 1 hr window) so we all waited. When the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left. We had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff compounded by their inability to actually keep people in a queue. When we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight. Again, we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the Zanzibar airport. They then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed (an hour before takeoff) we still would not have been able to board the plane. Why not? Why would they sell us a ticket on Kenya Airways own website that was a fraud? The entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again, randomly talking to other customers who just walked up (like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the Kenya Airways attendants booked her to the wrong country - I didn't really blame her), checking their phones, and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable. They were flippant and did not care. Having been at the desk or waiting in the queue for an hour, we were now about to miss the next leg of our vacation stuck in the airport again because of Kenya Airlines. Part of our group was with one attendant at the desk and the others were with the other attendant so they herded us together to one desk ... and promptly ignored us since there were about five other people crowded at the desk also demanding information and assistance. Finally another attendant walked up and told us they will put us in a hotel since they have no other flights until the next afternoon, 17 hours after we had landed, and we should walk to the immigration area and he will be right with us to help us. We go to the immigration area, fill out the paperwork, and wait ... and wait ... and wait. We go back to get him and he said he will be right there, but does not show up again and we wait. The man finally comes and gets us through immigration and now tells us to go downstairs and get a hotel. We find the hotel line and wait some more until Magdalyn at the desk is able to assist us. She was kind and very professional though, not any fault of her own, the hotels available were not in any way, shape or form five stars like we had been told. After booking our stay we were told to go outside to the shuttle. The shuttle is a large older bus and though 90% full when we arrived, we had to wait there until every single seat was taken which was well over 30 more minutes. Finally they were able to take us to our hotels (different people on the bus were staying at different hotels) and we checked in around 1 am, nearly four hours after we had landed. Our meals were provided and other than the hotel being outdated and loud, was fine for a night, it just seems a waste of money for Kenya Airlines in that this whole situation could have been avoided with a little proficiency in your customer service department, not to mention you had now wasted another complete day of ours. The next morning we got up, went to breakfast and immediately left again for the airport - this time with a private shuttle that was much better. We arrive just after 11 a.m. for a\n2:50 p.m. flight. Do you think that flight was on time? Of course not. At 2:20 we are standing at the entrance to the seating area (in Nairobi you have to go through another desk to get to your gates specific seating area) and nobody was there. Thirty minutes later when our flight was supposed to be leaving, there was still not any Kenya Airline attendants to be seen. None of the screens in the airport were updated and our flight was still showing as \"on time\" - which was physically impossible since there was not even an airplane on our ramp. One of the airline attendants finally showed up and said we are delayed for approximately two more hours due to maintenance, but would not let us in the seating area so all the passengers just milled about outside or wandered down the terminal to find other seats. After getting to board, the flight staff was wonderfully fine and we had no issues with them, though none of the televisions in the headrest worked on the flights.\n\nI understand that situations arise when traveling and flexibility is key - but I have an issue when those situations become acceptable norms and your Kenya Airlines staff remain aloof and complacent, further complicating the experience. Of what was supposed to be a relaxing 96 hour trip, 31 ADDITIONAL hours (I did not include the time we expected to spend when we booked our flights) were spent in Nairobi due to an utter failure by Kenya Airlines. Not to mention we lost an entire day of our vacation and all expenses incurred with it.\n\nI sent an email to Kenya Airlines first and they sent me a completely professional and respectful reply back - though quit disparaging by stating \"we sincerely regret the inconveniences caused to you as a result of the one hour delay of your flight from Djibouti to Nairobi.\" The one hour delay is NOT what this about.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/5f/61/34/amy-a.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyLoverOfSun","crvsd":"AmyLoverOfSun wrote a review Sep 2016","ui_header_link":"AmyLoverOfSun","default":"Ogden, Utah","phmbo":"432 contributions","phmbo1":"129 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Djibouti - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r420812396-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Spent 30+ hrs of a 96 hr trip stuck at airport due to inept customer service","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have experienced how Harare airport supervisor of Kenya airways is running away from passengers and keeping them stranded waiting for flight at mid night. I have experienced how special meal request of passenger is not followed by airline staff. I have experienced how rude airline staff can be with its passengers. I have experienced how a problem is handled by airline staff from simple to worst.\n\nOn a lighter note if you are traveling by Kenya Airways remember its airline code as KQ means 'Keep Quite' as the there is absolutely no use of making any complaint to ground staff.\n\nIn my opinion instead of improving on its operations Kenya airways shall change its logo from 'Pride of Africa' to 'Shame of Africa' at least passengers will be ready for experience.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/47/f5/94/bonnerbonn-germany.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonnerBonn_Germany","crvsd":"BonnerBonn_Germany wrote a review Sep 2016","ui_header_link":"BonnerBonn_Germany","default":"Bonn, Germany","phmbo":"41 contributions","phmbo1":"10 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Entebbe - Harare","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r416188224-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Kenya airways need to improve its operations","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Firstly their flights en route to Mumbai are quite horrible whereas at one time they used to be really good. Maybe because they sold their dreamliners and kept only those that go to Europe.Food options are not that good and sometimes the flights are more expensive that Emirates ! They are extremely convenient for both business and leisure purposes as they travel directly to the destination without stopover. Also, their frequent flier program is slightly flawed. I have taken 10 flights this year yet I need to make 5 more to be eligible for a silver card.

I went straight to the self-check-in machines and within less than a minute printed my boarding card. All good.\nThen the debacle began - it took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to check my bag (and that process took less than a minute). The airline that calls itself 'The Pride of Africa' has no facility for international travellers to drop their bags. You join the (extremely long) check-in queue and shuffle along whilst only TWO check-in attendants were on duty (out of 7 counters). That took 80 minutes.\nNo management anywhere to be seen.\nNo apologies to the irate passengers who, like me, had their boarding cards and simply wanted to drop off their luggage.\nI eventually found a supervisor who, when I asked her why the airline was treating their passengers like this, replied, whilst constantly scrolling down on her phone and without looking up 'I feel you'.\nWhat on earth is that supposed to mean?\nI then started talking to KQ on Facebook begging them to send more check-in personal. They also said sorry but did nothing.\nI then sent many messages asking for an explanation (all available for the airline to see) but nothing was forthcoming.\nI received a cut-and-paste-get-rid-of-this-passenger-quickly email apology which was utterly meaningless. I replied saying not good enough. I was then asked to log onto their customer services portal to continue the discussion. More hoops for what?\nI am a member of the tourism industry in Kenya and am ashamed and heartbroken by the dismissive and dreadful service offered by the national airline. I don't think they care a hoot.\nAll well and good but I would urge any customers who have a choice to avoid flying KQ at all costs. If not, good luck with the queues and budget many hours for check-in and don't bother using preprinted boarding cards - just adds to your frustration.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/9d/5d/30/nickyfitz54.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyFitzKenya","crvsd":"NickyFitzKenya wrote a review Sep 2016","ui_header_link":"NickyFitzKenya","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"44 contributions","phmbo1":"56 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r413857860-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"I did all I could to get Kenya Airways to communicate with me","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This plane feels cramped compared to the 777s which they used to fly. The seating is just too tight. This aircraft has the same three rows of three seats as the 777 but the whole plane is narrower making the seating and aisles narrower. On my last flight I was hit more than once by the trolly as the cabin crew pushed it up the narrow aisle and the passenger next to me took up the armrest. On internal flights in Kenya they use the Embrayer 190 and this is an excellent, comfortable aircraft.\n\nOverall Kenya Airways are a good airline with competant pilots and friendly cabin crew. The food is ok and there is plenty of free drink if you ask for it.

In London, I double-checked with one of their employee to make sure my luggage was going straight to Kilimanjaro. After calling somebody in charge of luggage, the employee confirmed that was the final destination.\n\nThe plane ( a bit old with worn out seats) was delayed in London for 2 hours (we stayed in the plane in very hot conditions waiting for departure). I missed the connection on Flight KQ 0432 to Kilimanjaro. On my insistence, I was re-booked on Flight PW 722 with Precision Air that left the same morning at 8:00 am. When we got there 9 passenger did not have their luggage. Two of them, who we're climbing the Kilimanjaro the next day, had been given the same reassuring speech about their luggage in London...\n\nLogically, I did not expect my luggage to be on that last flight (because of the short delay), but I expected it later on in the day. Unfortunately, it seems that it had never left London (according to information given by the company when they found it) and was redirected finally on June 27th 2016. I got it on June 29th 2016 fortunately because our tour operator(Simba Safari) had the courtesy to bring it where I was in my journey. Meanwhile, everyday from the 24th to the 27th of June, when we've called to have information, they said it was coming in the day...\n\nSince I was leaving for a 7 day safari on the morning of June 25th, I went to buy some clothes.\n\nA few days after my return home, I've sent a formal complaint by e-mail to the company, on July 12th 2016 and a following e-mail on July 29th 2016. Besides the automated reply mentioning an incident number and that the matter would be resolved by July 15th 2016, not a word from Kenya Airways.\n\nI must say I was very disappointed by this first experience with Kenya Airways. Not only by the delayed luggage, but also by the fact that the connection to Kilimanjaro was not held, even though 15 to 20 people had to take that connection. As I mentioned before,I also had to insist on being booked on the next available flight that day, because they had decided to book me on a flight leaving at 4:00pm (some we're booked on a flight to Zanzibar at 11:30pm!). I would have spent another 9 hours uselessly at Nairobi Airport for a 50 minute flight.\n\nI read that the company is restructuring. I think they should pay more attention to customer service if they want to maintain their clientele. That applies even after the flight.\n\nIn all fairness, through all these events, employees of Kenya Airways were always courteous.\n\nMy other flight (at the end of my safari) with Kenya Airways, Kilimanjaro-Nairobi-Zanzibar went without a glitch. The plane was a recent one and very nice.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/35/d1/89/fmlaffs.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmlaffs","crvsd":"fmlaffs wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"fmlaffs","default":"Montreal","phmbo":"22 contributions","phmbo1":"39 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r412051290-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Not sure about \"The pride of Africa\".","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Of course when you're traveling and make arrangements well in advance you can't cancel or change other reservations.The check in  person  from Kenya Airways attempted to extort $10 from for the baggage. He actually said \" I was trying to see if you pay it\". Once on board the Embraer 190, I find it to be small and uncomfortable with no working Entertainment System or air conditioning. The stewardesses,Victoria, was either naturally grouchy or having a bad hair day. I don't expect to have a waste bag forced in front of my face to put a towel in, and I don't expect to told \"it's over there\" when I asked for some water.

Our experience was that Kenya Airways cancelled both of the flights we booked within 1 week of our departure and rebooked us on 5th Aug 08.00 and on 10th August at 09.00.\nThe first change meant that we had to book another night of accommodation in Nairobi and the second gave us the prospect of a 15hr layover at JKIA before our return flight to London. On the 3rd Aug we were informed by email that our 08.00 flight to Malindi had been cancelled and we were rebooked on a Jambo Jet flight at 09.40 on the 5th. During the evening of the 4th Aug our Jambo Jet flight time was changed to 11.00 back to 09.40 and then back to 11.00 in the space of 2 hours with the final change after 10pm when we were asleep. We ended up at the airport at 08.00 in case the flight was on time, the flight finally took off at around 13.30 and we arrived in Malindi nearly a day late which in a 6 day visit is quite significant. We rebooked our return flight from Mombasa in the evening of the 10th to avoid wasting another day of our holiday in JKIA. Kenya Airways is strong on communicating how sincere they are about the inconvenience caused by the series of changes however, not a single member of their staff expressed any regrets and no compensation of any sort was offered. The additional costs we incurred included a £60 taxi cost to get to Mombasa airport, in addition to the hotel in Nairobi plus the delayed arrival inconvenience. Our experience was one of incompetence and complete lack of regard for their customers. There are several alternatives for internal flights in Kenya and I recommend you use them.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcar38","crvsd":"dcar38 wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"dcar38","default":"Epsom, United Kingdom","phmbo":"12 contributions","phmbo1":"19 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Malindi","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r405171537-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Tourists Beware - this airline is terrible for internal flights in Kenya","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I can honestly say that we were very impressed and loved flying Kenya Airways for the first-time within east-central and south-central flown part of our African Escapade.                                           The plane was super-clean, seats were spacious and comfortable, the food and beverages served were one of the best, and especially the whole-cashews snack-pouch was delightfully filling and tasty; they served the highest-quality, humongous-sized cashews we ever ate. The attendants were also cool about giving these snacks a few more extras to munch on with your drink. I saved a couple for later. The crew on-board were very friendly, had a good sense of humor and they were willing to assist you in every way they could. Bathrooms in the plane were the best I ever experienced flying domestic or anywhere international. With wider and deepest sinks I ever used in a flight and easy-operating sink-faucets like the ones at home, their bathrooms were the most spacious, cleanest and the best  on-board. We didn’t use Wi-Fi but I believe it was not offered on this flight. With comfortable seats we took a snooze instead.                                         We flew about an hour from JRO to NBO, and it was a little over 2-hour layover at Nairobi Airport where we had lunch at their new terminal opened early 2015. There were spacious lounges, cafes, restaurants, shops and had an easy access to nice bathrooms at all nearby Gates and exits throughout the new terminal at Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta International. They’ve made the terminal exceptionally easy to navigate, very convenient and the most comfortable I experienced on the continent. The Airport staff at our gate’s departure was very friendly, courteous, accommodating and most importantly very patient when we arrived slightly late. We were completely unaware, and did not know that we had to board a transit-bus at the tarmac from our departure-gate to the aircraft; they calmed our anxiety down and helped us board the bus in time, although we weren’t late or the last to board. Our onward flight to Livingstone was also very comfortable. On our return flight we stayed/slept overnight in Aspire Lounge of JK Nairobi Intl. Airport. At US$30 for 3-hrs., we paid $180 for 6-hrs for the three of us. The Lounge was comfortable with good food and drinks laid out on counters, a TV sitting area, and the night-host/attendant joined together armless sofa-chairs for us to sleep. There are no showers in Aspire Lounge, but it was a good lounge to get a bite to eat, grab a drink, relax/doze off, and the staff is willing to help you with anything.                                      When compared to taking any domestic flights within North American continent, we are quite impressed and pleased to say that on the African side of planet, the Kenya Airways flight, its crew and its Airport staff surpassed our expectations.

I had everything with me, tickets and boardingpasses. I was at the Airport early enough, means three hours before planned departure\nThe flight got delayed to leave Dar going to NBI. Usually I would have had 59 minutes to change the plane, now I had only a few minutes, but I still made it to the Boarding gate in time. As I arrived at the gate 19, I was told that they only have one seat for one passenger and they gave this one seat to an adult person, although I had my boarding pass and seat number. Now, I am a girl of 17 years, means according to law I am still under age, not an adult yet, and I am travelling alone, no parent or friend with me. Now, they decided to leave me as girl alone behind in an foreign country. The ticket was booked and payed for in March this year- no last minute ticket.\nAfter that I was sent to the Kenya Airways Service Counter, there they told me that they see going to rebook my flight for another day. The Lady who was working on my Boarding Ticket didn't give me the Information I needed, I asked what will happen when I arrive in Paris? She couldn't give me a proper answer to that, she sometimes told me u will be flying to Amsterdam and i asked Amsterdam? Why? Then she told me no you are flying to Paris.The Lady then went somewhere to work for my Ticket and took a really long time about 30 min or so, when she came back she gave me my Boarding Ticket and I was then sent to the immigration to get a stamp. I got my stamp, and was then sent to the Kenya Airways Hotel Counter, I arrived there and they gave me my old and my new Boarding Ticket, they told me to which Hotel I was going to. I had to wait for the transport that took us to the Hotel, which later I discovered has realy bad reviews in the internet.I was in the Airport for 2hrs And 36 mins because of this things above.

But do make sure that any one bag does not exceed 20 kg. This way you can have check in luggage of up to 40 kg and still have carry on luggage etc.\nAlthough they are not rated as one of the top airlines of the world, it is a very convenient and cheaper option to fly long distances, although flights may be few and far apart, so make sure you book way in advance.\nAlso - be sure to wear very easy clothes as you will have to remove your shoes, belt and any other garment/ accessory that may contain metal EVEN when you just do a climb over at Kenyata airport in Nairobi. It may also be handy to have a small fold up bag ready that you can dump all the items you had to take off in so you can easily get them on the other side of the scanner. They do provide plastic baskets for this, but there are way too few of them and you may end up having to leave your stuff on the floor.\nShould you have to wait some time at the airport I would advise that you have a few $US handy, since the restaurants do not have credit card facilities and the places that do are sometimes offline or the connection can be very slow.\nMy flight was cancelled at very short notice, and since I was a single traveler - they proposed to get me on a flight of their affiliated airline Ethiopian Air. This helped a lot and Ethiopian is not a bad low cost airline either. Should you encounter a problem like this, you may want to ask if they can move you over to Ethiopian Airways. I do however believe they can only do this for one or two passengers since they have to be sure of availability of seats.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/97/33/65/max-m.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxM93","crvsd":"Max M wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"Max M","default":"Patong, Thailand","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"54 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Bangkok - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r401169261-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Surprisingly good service from a low cost airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Perfect service on 3 of the 4 flights. Fantastic staff. The long haul aircraft were Dreamliners which are my favourites! So spacious (which helps me massively as I'm a nervous flyer). I was unwell on the return flight to Heathrow (a bug I'd picked up while away) so I was so thankful that the planes are so comfortable (and the staff kindly kept me stocked with sick bags!). Fantastic entertainment options - even had screens and music etc on the 4 hour flight between Nairobi & Antananarivo which I was amazed about. (Only unfortunate experience was on the flight back to Nairobi from Antananarivo - the air con wasn't working so it was sweltering - plus my screen & music wouldn't work). Overall though I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them, especially for long haul.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88happytravels","crvsd":"88happytravels wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"88happytravels","default":"Hampshire","phmbo":"26 contributions","phmbo1":"12 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Antananarivo","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r400969614-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Fantastic experience, Brand new planes, Faultless","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2015","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Worth bringing your own headset and an airplane adapter cheap of ebay, because the quality of sound on the headset provided is poor.\n\nThat's about all the positives.\n\nFirst of all, the staff on the flight were plain rude. Zero communication skills. If you didn't quite catch what they said or wanted, they would just hover over you with a frown, without saying what they were after for the second time until you magically discovered what was going on. For example when serving hot beverages tea and coffee were served couple minutes apart. No big deal. The cart is approaching, I'm saying coffee please and put the cup on the tray. Not a word. Just a frown. Could I get some coffee please? So they would not say straight away that it's gonna be served separately and I should take mu cup back, they would just stand there with an impatient expression growing.\n\nThe attendants plain ignore the 'require assistance' light. My friend had it on for 12 minutes, no reaction whatsoever, an attendant passed her by with a tea pot but did not bother to stop and ask what's going on. Fortunately, all my friend needed was a drink, so having noted these are being served she switched the light off. Had she needed anything more serious she might as well forget it unless you start kicking and screaming that you need help. Which gets awkward if you're not dying, but just need some discreet assistance.\n\nFood was ok, the main course was a bit too salty, but I could live with that. The croissant on the connecting flight to Mombasa tasted like genuine English mould, scraped off the cellar wall. At least that's what it smelled of. I'm not sure it was stored in improper conditions or what the cause was. You don't get drinks outside of your set meal times (the light gets ignored if you turn it on) so bring your own water even if you feel you're not going to need some, as the air gets really dry on this long flight.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/c8/9f/4c/savrii.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savrii","crvsd":"savrii wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"savrii","default":"","phmbo":"7 contributions","phmbo1":"13 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r400543310-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Customer service is non existent","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Unfortunately, the KQ's staff (particularly those working at Nairobi JKIA) seem utterly demotivated, and some are outright hostile towards customers. The contempt for paying customers is evident from the moment you enter JKIA, and sadly it rarely ends once you board the aircraft. I have had the misfortune to witness many incidents of Kenya Airways staff harassing and shouting down passengers who dared to complain. Interesting, KQ staff seem to have a particular disdain for their fellow Africans. It is truly unfortunate that Kenya Airways' managers do not care about their company's international reputation, nor do they worry about the damage their shoddy management is doing to the entire tourism industry in Kenya. Very depressing.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ngawa7","crvsd":"Ngawa7 wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"Ngawa7","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"25 contributions","phmbo1":"9 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Yaounde","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r399898872-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Overpriced, Nairobi JKIA is a major handicap","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2015","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

But today, KA also fly the Dreamliner. I now regularly fly on one between Nairobi and Johannesburg, which is just a 4 hour flight. So my question to KA is, why don't you use the Dreamliner on the 9-10 hour flight across to Freetown. You fly 7 days a week, which is great, and the flights are always full, so I just wish you would upgrade the plane for such a long flight, and if capacity is the problem, cut back slightly on the number of flights,\nAnother small gripe is that I have been a Flying Blue Silver Card member for most of those 5 years, though I did lose that status when you stopped flying because of Ebola, but I now have it back again. In all that time I have never been upgraded once. There aren't many perks for being a Silver Card holder.\nOne more comment. In all of my 5 years of flying with KA, I have never received bad service from 1 of your cabin staff. They are all to be highly commended. South African Airways can learn something from your staff. Please keep it up.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/71/8f/64/russianiwi.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russianiwi","crvsd":"russianiwi wrote a review Jul 2016","ui_header_link":"russianiwi","default":"Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","phmbo":"47 contributions","phmbo1":"18 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Freetown","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r398932857-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Give us the Dreamliner","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I traveled from Dubai to Nairobi (KQ311) and then connected to Cape Town (KQ782) with a 40 minute stopover in Livingstone, Zambia. In Livingstone some people got off and the plane was cleaned/tidied, even the pillow cases of the vacant seats were changed which I thought was a nice touch since I haven't seen this done before. The check-in was smooth and efficient, I especially liked the fact that I got 2 bags of 23kg each checked in luggage and the same applied to my return flight which was with a different airline. (When you purchase one ticket with different airlines, the baggage allowance of the first airline applies. I flew back with EK and had no problem checking in with the extra baggage allowance. FYI. Flights were booked on Orbitz) Both flights were very comfortable, the aircraft's were clean and the pilots kept us up to date throughout of the flights, informing us ahead of time when we would experience some turbulence, etc. The connection between the two flights was quick and efficient. The aircraft between Nairobi and Cape Town had leather seats which I didn't expect but I really liked. The in-flight entertainment didn't work but to be honest I really didn't mind. The screen is quite small though and I most probably wouldn't have enjoyed watching a movie on it anyway. The food is average but adequate. Don't expect any of the luxuries that you would experience when flying with bigger, more popular airlines, you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for a clean, comfortable, value for money airline, then this is it.  I will definitely fly with them again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327rener","crvsd":"Rene R wrote a review Jul 2016","ui_header_link":"Rene R","default":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"48 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dubai - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r398311698-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Pleasantly surprised","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was no communication at all to inform us prior to us reaching the airport. The first ground staff whom we encountered could only tell us he did not know anything, his supervisor was not around and we were to wait for further instructions. He seemed extremely eager to go off duty.\nWe were kept waiting for another hour for a lady staff to show up and issue hotel accommodation vouchers. When she showed up, she just took our boarding passes and wrote out everything by hand slowly. When we asked what other flights we could take, she just carried on writing out vouchers for other passengers, ignoring us until we pressed further. The reply was extremely unhelpful. We were to wait till tomorrow morning to check in and we would find out what flight we could take. By then, this was already 11pm. We had been at the airport since 930pm. This lady's name was Immaculate. She was dismissive and basically displayed an attitude that was highly unsuitable for customer service.\nWe waited another hour to get to the only staff who was actually helping stranded passengers. Unfortunately, he was stuck helping a group of passengers check in their bags for close to an hour. The poor staff, Derrick, was left alone to deal with the crisis as all his colleagues on duty at that time just ditched him and disappeared despite the fact that there were more than 20 people waiting.\nHe tried to get us flights back to Singapore but the only option that would get us back in time for our commitments was to transit in 7 hours in Mumbai. Imagine if we had listened to Immaculate and just showed up the next day only to realise that we might have been stranded yet again.\nBy now, it was close 2 am after everything had been sorted out. We went to the bus provided to bring us to the hotel which was supposed a 5 star hotel as told to us by the ground staff but the situation became even more farcical from this point onwards. We were told it was only 10 to 15 minutes. After 30 minutes of driving, the bus driver brought us to the first Pride Hotel. It was discovered that it was the wrong one after some passengers. The same thing occurred when we were driven to the second. Only by the third try was it correct cos they have exhausted all the options for Pride Hotel in Nairobi. By this time, it was 240am.\nCheck in was a mess with tired passengers trying to get rooms. When we got to our rooms, there was no bedsheets and pillowcases. When my friend asked for them, the hotel receptionist said then you can give up your rooms to this couple who did not get one (yes, Kenya Airways actually issued hotel vouchers but did not Ensure that there were enough rooms for stranded passengers). Pride Hotel is definitely not a 5 star hotel.\nBy the time we got to sleep, it was 3am. We had to leave the hotel by 5am to catch our 7am flight out of Nairobi. The bus to the airport left only at 525am cos we were all waiting for one passenger. By the time we got to the airport, it was 610am and we needed to board at 630am. This meant a mad rush through all different checkpoints.\nWe made it to our flight barely on time.\nBy the time we landed in Mumbai, I was having gastric issues, no thanks to the lack of sleep, stress and dehydration cos it took very long to get water on board the flight. However, we were stuck in the transit area and were told we needed to wait til 730pm to get into the area where we could get access to food. This was at 430pm. And this reason for this was because Kenya Airways did not issue our boarding passes for the connecting flight. Thankfully, the ground staff at Mumbai airport were much more helpful. They arranged for an airport doctor to see me and they issued temporary boarding passes so that I could at least get food which Kenya Airways did not pay for despite the fact that it was their fault we were diverted.\nThe whole chain of events on that night/day was a debacle. Having flights cancelled is usual and cannot be avoided but what could have been avoided is the lack of apologies and the desire to at least help stranded passengers get home. Kenya Airways should look into more training for staff in managing crises especially for this particular staff called Immaculate and have a proper SOP. It only managed to make tired and confused passengers angrier and angrier through the long waits, lack of information and apologies, and avoidable mistakes at different points.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jrt95","crvsd":"Jrt95 wrote a review Jul 2016","ui_header_link":"Jrt95","default":"Singapore, Singapore","phmbo":"19 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Bangkok","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r396058941-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Horrible service recovery for flight cancellation","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Nice plane, good food and entertainment, and well-stocked bar.  The flight attendants were helpful and didn't act like I was a criminal when I asked for more wine.  The internal flight was good although it ended up costing me $90 USD instead of the $50 USD I had been quoted to change the day my flight went from Nairobi to Malindi.I was on safari from the 1st to the 6th and did not bring my computer.  I checked in on the 7th and paid for the change.  The people I dealt with did not mention that the return portion of my ticket had been changed.  I only found out that the Malindi to Nairobi leg of my flight had been changed because of another traveller. I went to the Kenya Airways office in Malindi and after waiting for an hour while another traveller complained about something, I decided to try to get the information another way.The reception at my hotel was able to get me on-line where the on-line check in said there was a 'problem' with my ticket so he called the customer service line. My flight had been changed to 10 a.m.  Now I would have to wait approx. 12 hours in Nairobi Airport. Kenya Airways only has one flight per day to Bangkok.

A couple of years ago I'd have chosen KQ over most of its competitors, including European and Asian operators.\n\nI'm very sad to say though that there has been a marked decline in service quality over the past 12 months, and I'm now at the stage where I am scoping alternatives.\n\nI believe there have been cuts in staff, and this is clearly showing now on the 'shop floor'. The customer services desks in Jomo Kenyata Airport are simply awful. What should be simple queries are turning into absolute epics because staff seem to lack even basic knowledge on how to deal with straightforward everyday queries. It's not the fault of the staff - it's a clear training gap.\n\nLast month I had a flight cancelled for the umpteenth time for 'operational reasons' (that old chestnut. The staff informed us we would be put up in a hotel over night. The hotel was less than a mile from the airport. From informing us of the cancellation to getting us into that hotel took them 6 hours!? This delay was entirely down to the customer services staff not having a clue what they were supposed to do.\n\nThe online 'help desk' is also utterly useless. Email queries go unanswered. The supposed 'live chat' service goes unanswered. When you do get an advisor, they are rarely able to answer your query satisfactorily.\n\nI have umpteen similar tales. KQ are a shadow of their former selves.

The plane was new, the service was great, no complaints.

Instead it turned into a long, smelly and unsafe bus ride to a hotel in an industrial town. We had to wait almost 2 hours for the bus as there were so many people and not enough transport. There were business class passengers squashed onto a rickity mini bus to their hotel. In the morning we were told the bus would collect us at 7am, it arrived at 8:30- with no explanation and constant worry that we may miss our new flight. There was no coordination, the airport was chaos as no one knew which forms to fill out and where we were going. In the end we missed out on a day of Travel in Bangkok, as we arrived at 1am instead of lunch time.  Since then I have done some research and have found that \"cancelled flight due to a technical issues\" is a common occurance on Kenya Airways. The seats were small, the food is very average, some staff were friendly and others were cold. On our way back to South Africa, our flight was delayed again by 30 minutes, we were so worried that we were going to miss our connecting flight to Johannesburg. This was our honeymoon and this experience really put a damper on our long travel to Thailand and added a lot of stress and anxiety ontop of going to a country we had never been to before. The reason we booked Kenya Airways because they had shorter travelling times than some of the other airlines, but in the end it cost us a day of travelling :-( Then the other part was all the timely security checks at the airport,I'm pretty sure this is what leads to the delays. Will never use this airline again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233cherylf","crvsd":"Cheryl F wrote a review Mar 2016","ui_header_link":"Cheryl F","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Bangkok","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r359842118-Kenya_Airways-World.html","qwuub":"Cancelled connecting flight due to technical issues- seems like this happens often with this airline.","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The fish (no choice) was inedible followed by a piece of cake which was so dry it was again a definite no no.   Thank goodness we had some chocolate or it would have been a long hungry night!  The air hostess serving our part of the plane left a lot to be desired.   She was curt and did not really seem to care if we were there or not.   On other airlines water/juice is brought round very regularly during the night but not this time.    I pressed my call button and eventually they brought me water but I felt I was being a total nuisance.   Breakfast was equally disgusting - a very watery dish of omelette, soggy tomato and potato which again was left untouched - such a waste.   Coffee eventually arrived which was ok.Such a disappointment after the wonderful Kenyan people we had met in Mombasa.

However, I soon found that this seating plan did not exist when I arrived at the airport with 6'5\" and 6'2\" family members.  Lea at the KA desk in London automatically allocated extra legroom - FREE OF CHARGE - when she saw my family and we travelled in comfort from London to Nairobi.  She was really helpful and understanding of our predicament.  We arrived deliberately early at the airport to secure extra legroom.However, our treatment at Mombasa airport was the opposite with absolutely dire  airport staff refusing to allocate extra legroom unless it was purchased, in Nairobi, at a cost of US$79.00 per person.  I explained the difference in our treatment at London Heathrow Airport and was again, told that I could purchase extra legroom, if available, once in Nairobi for our flight to London as it was all controlled by staff at Nairobi airport.  I was told that IF there were any unpurchased extra legroom seats on our connecting flight, staff MIGHT consider allocating them to my family, but that was not guaranteed. I had to argue the point that my family physically could not fit in economy seats, that there was no way to purchase extra legroom when making my reservation, that I had called the airline in advance to try to arrange this and that it was not the fault of the traveller for being too tall to fit in economy seats.  My family and I were also seated separately, in different rows for our return flights, despite asking at check in to be seated together.  I had to argue to have our seats changed to sitting together after the lady at check in had lied repeatedly saying that the flight was full.  A truly rubbishy service from KA in Kenya.After much arguing at Mombasa airport with a manager named J Ananga, I was permitted to purchase extra legroom seats at Mombasa and not have to wait until our arrival at Nairobi even though we had had free extra legroom seats on our outbound flights.  That said, this involved going in and out of supposed 'security check' areas several times in order to retrieve my credit card, passports etc from the gate area. without anyone batting an eyelid!!  Food was terrible, staff could barely speak English or pronounce menu items.  Don't even think about reclining your seat because if the fat Kenyan man behind you complains, you'll be asked to sit upright despite the fact that it's a night flight and want to sleep!Would I recommend Kenya Airways?

We were on flight KQ101 Heathrow to Nairobi on a 787 dreamliner, I had chosen seats in row 17 right over the wing as I had read this was the quietist area to be in. There was an impressive choice of films to watch, the food served was quite tasty and the seats, considering this was economy, were quite comfortable. The first leg of our trip was a 7.5 hour flight, followed by a layover of about 5 hours at Nairobi before boarding an Embraer 190, flight KQ780 for a 2.5 hour flight on to Livingstone. Overall I was very impressed with the airline and can definitely recommend them to anybody contemplating a trip to Africa. We booked about 5 months in advance and got our flights for <£500 each, return. For those of you who are plane spotters, the 787 was aircraft no. 5Y-KZH and the Embraer 190 was 5Y-FFG.
