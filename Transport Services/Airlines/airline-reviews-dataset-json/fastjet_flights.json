[{"Title":"My return trip was - out on Monday and back on Friday! A seamless flight which kept time during both legs, overseen by efficient, courteous staff. The snacks were fresh. However, there is a need to watch the high sugar and salt content. There was a slight muddle at check-in in Victoria Falls over ticketing, but that was swiftly resolved. A bonus on the trip was flying over the Falls on the way from Victoria Falls- a spectacular sight! Fastjet is a small and efficient airline which makes the round trip worth repeating.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kufunda","crvsd":"Kufunda wrote a review Nov 2022","ui_header_link":"Kufunda","default":"Harare, Zimbabwe","phmbo":"355 contributions","phmbo1":"118 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Harare - Victoria Falls","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r868475952-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Spoilt for choice!","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A plane and crew were miraculously found approx. 90 mins later (around 12 noon).

I had  purchased the ticket  through Flight  Centre  Rosebank. Today, 4  august, I’m  still in Johannesburg  with no  idea  when or  whether  I will ever  fly on that ticket. I presented myself  at  the Fastjet  checkin  counter  over  2  and  a half  hours  before  departure. I presented to  them  my valid  passport  and  negative  covid test  result, which test  had  been done on 2 August. To  my horror, I was  informed that  I wasn’t  booked on the flight  and  should consult  with the Fastjet  reservation office  which was  conveniently located directly behind  the check initial reception was  courteous. The gentlemen manning  the counter  checked my ticket  and  informed me that  inin  counters. My their  system my ticket  had  been cancelled. I  called  Flight  Centre  Rosebank who  immediately spoke to  the Fastjet folks. I guess  I should note  that  the Fastjet  counter  is  manned by Menzies  staff  who  provide services to  Fastjet. Obviously, the intricacies  of these  relationships  are  lost  on me. As  far  as  I was  concerned I was  dealing  with Fastjet. The conversations  between Fastjet  and  Flight  Centre  Rosebank continued until  boarding  closed and the plane  departed. As  I don’t  live  in  Johannesburg, my next  concer n was  accommodation food and transport  to  get  to  the accommodation.  Around  5pm, I communicated again with Flight  Centre Rosebank who  informed me that  at  that  point  it  was  unlikely that  I would fly that  day, notwithstanding  the fact  that  there  was  a Fastjet flight  leaving  for  Harare  after  6  pm. I shared my concerns  re  accommodation etc  with accommodation etc. They advised that  I check into  a hotel and retain all my receipts. In  the aftermath of  this  mess  they would seek reimbursement  from  Fastjet. Thus, my search for  a hotel began. City Lodge  OR Tambo  and  InterContinental  OR Tambo  were  both fully booked. I  proceeded to  the shuttle parking  lot  and  eventually managed shuttle driver  from  Birchwood Hotel and Conference  centre  to  book the last with the help  of  a room  they had. Note that  the search for  a hotel room  involved walking  around  the airport  for  more  than two  hours dragging  behind  my 30kgs  of  luggage. I woke up this  morning  4  August  uncertain.  Everything  about  this  trip  is  now  uncertain.  By  9.30am  I had spoken to  Flight  Centre  Rosebank who  were  commencing  the second  round in the battle with Fastjet  to  secure  me  a seat  for  a flight  I booked and paid  for  more  than a week ago. I’m  sitting  at  the BC  Café  at  the Birchwood Hotel and Conference  Centre  watching  f lights  landing  at  departing  from OR Tambo. I think its  been over  48  hours  since  I took my  covid test  so  it  may no  longer  be valid  for entry into  Zimbabwe. In  the event  that  Fastjet  succeeds  in  securing  a seat  for  me today, I will  have the worry of  the Covi d test where  to  get  one done. I noticed that  the Dischem  covid testing  station in  OR Tambo  has  been dismantled. I have  kept  receipts  for  the hotel and for  a early dinner  I  had yesterday. While  Flight  Centre Rosebank may fight for  a reimbursement  of  thes e  expenses Fastjet  may refuse  any such request. I got a call from Flight Centre Rosebank notifying me to get to the airport cos i had been waitlisted for the 6pm flight. I took the hotel shuttle and  endured a long wait before being checked in. Fast forward to a couple of hours later.  We landed in Harare to find most of our luggage had been left in joburg. There was much wailing among the passengers some of whom were attending weddings early the next day. Judging by the rows of luggage arranged in different groupings,  i guess, indicating different flights, leaving luggage was the norm. So on 5 August, I went back to the Harare airport at 5pm to collect my luggage.  So what is supposed to be a 1.40 minute flight between Johannesburg and Harare turned out to be a saga starting on 3 August and ending on 5 August. And Fastjet believes I was not sufficiently inconvenienced.

First, I was informed that my flight was completely canceled while checking in my luggage. This was an evening flight so this means I would only be able to go home the next day. There were absolutely no notifications sent out so all the passengers showed up to the airport. The staff assisted everyone who's been disrupted in booking them on the next available flight, the next morning at 6am. Everyone was told that check-in starts at 4h40am. Again, all the passengers arrived early only to be told, once again upon check-in, that the flight will be delayed up until 10h30am.

Flight was supposed to be at 6.40am to arrive in Johannesburg at 8am. We checked in as usual and boarded. After about 15 minutes into the stationary plane we were asked to disembark and wait  in the lounge for 5minuted since the plane had a technical fault. The 5 minutes turned to hours and were promised three times that another plane was coming from Johannesburg to take us. All proved to be false promises since along the way we would be told that the plane was forced to turn back to Johannesburg midway through it's journey. It was false promise after false promise throughout the day and after a lot of shouting and complaining they had to put us on a South Africa Express flight which left bulawayo at after 6PM. Again we had another wait before takeoff with South Africa Express since they were given wrong names by fastjet. I finally arrived in Johannesburg around 7.45pm.

This was at the international terminal. A boarding call was announced but i did not get it since i was at the International terminal having breakfast. A last boarding call was then announced at the international terminal and that is when the Restaurant staff started making frantic efforts to get another POS machine from their coffee shop at the domestic terminal. They asked me to rush straight for security check whilst bringing the POS machine. Apologies were made to the Airport staff and they understood the cause of the delay however the Flight Captain had already made a decision for dropping the passenger way before the allowable time. There were discussions between the airport staff and the flight crew and eventually the airport staff advised to walk briskly on the tarmac and not run and board as the allowable time is still within acceptable limit. After boarding it took about 20 minutes before the door was closed. However, i am grateful to both airport staff and flight crew for reaching an amicable solution in allowing me to continue with the flight.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sphiri2018","crvsd":"sphiri2018 wrote a review Oct 2019","ui_header_link":"sphiri2018","default":"","phmbo":"16 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Victoria Falls - Harare","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r722951073-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Delayed on-boarding","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

However, it was the best option I could find for a flight to Vic Falls, so I booked through a third party who guarantees flights, and purchased flight insurance.  These precautions proved to be completely unnecessary.  I had a positive experience using this airline.  You simply need to read the airline's policies carefully and follow them.First, they state clearly that your flight time may change.  They also state that if the incoming flight arrives early, your flight may leave early.  So, I started checking the flight updates the evening before to make sure there were no changes.  I also showed up at the airport early, when check-in opened, which was over an hour early.Yes, this required some effort and some additional time spent in some very boring airports, but I made both my outgoing and return flight with absolutely no issues.The staff is friendly and helpful.  The flight was uneventful, and they serve a decent snack of two different pastries and a bottle of water.The plane was older (think ashtrays in the armrests!), but clean and appeared to be well-maintained.I think you need to remember that people are often more likely to write a negative review than a positive one.  So, the reviews you read may not accurately reflect the majority of customers of Fast Jet.  Overall, I would definitely recommend using the airline for hops between Harare and Vic Falls.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ilgogetmyball","crvsd":"Ilgogetmyball wrote a review Apr 2019","ui_header_link":"Ilgogetmyball","default":"Pleasant Grove, Utah","phmbo":"14 contributions","phmbo1":"14 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Harare - Victoria Falls","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r663749621-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Positive Experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I made an advance online booking with Fastjet because it offered a mid-morning flight at a convenient time on the date I wished to travel. Fastjet cancelled the flight and then informed me I needed to buy another (full-price) ticket. Yes folks. Their policy is is they cancel, you can pay for a new ticket. When I protested, Fast jet offered me a flight leaving at 6;30 am. This was not convenient, and they repeated that my options were, take this flight or buy a new ticket. After the exchange of many messages, my travel agent won an agreement from Fastjet that I could book a later flight on the same date, with no extra fees for the change of bookings. However when I arrived at Dar es Salaam to board my flight, I was informed that I must pay booking fees first. The booking fees were almost exactly the same price as new ticket. The booking clerk was incredibly rude and unhelpful. When asked for a receipt the clerk replied that Fastjet policy was not to give receipts. When pressed to supply proof of payment the clerk became belligerent. I boarded, after paying the fees. To make things worse, the plane sat on the runway for an hour after departure time, due to technical difficulties Fastjet was experiencing. So be warned. If you really need to use this airline, I suggest you book and fly immediately. I urge fellow travellers to boycott this airline until they change their policy. There are other, more reputable airlines, that fly the same routes. To date my travel agent has not been able to get a refund for the extra fees, even though she has proof from Fastjet that they were not going to charge them.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylH707","crvsd":"Cheryl H wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"Cheryl H","default":"Port Pirie, Australia","phmbo":"27 contributions","phmbo1":"5 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Mwanza","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r640243904-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Booking rip off","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I got back to UK, I did get a refund for my flight quite easily, so 2* for that fact, and I did fly with them back from Kilimanjaro to Dar es salaam with no issues.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marrioa05","crvsd":"marrioa05 wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"marrioa05","default":"Reading, United Kingdom","phmbo":"111 contributions","phmbo1":"89 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r579242745-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Nice airline, plane cancelled with no notice","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The travel agent was able to get a much better rate for us than what was published online by Fastjet.

We had to scramble at the airport in order to move stuff around between bags to reduce our check-in to one and make sure our carry-on bags don't exceed the weight limit (the airline agent meticulously weighed everything). This bag fee came as a surprise to many of the other tourists/travelers ahead of us in line.

Flying between these 2 cities has to be one of the most profitable routes in sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps 2nd only to the price gouging of other airlines on the Jhb-Gaborone route\n\nDon't fall for the advertising classifying them as a low-cost carrier - On this route, ticket prices range from borderline expensive to deep into rip-off category. Specifically, if you consider that everything from baggage to insurance to onboard drinks and snacks could be charged on top of the basic ticket price. To put their pricing in perspective - for the price 2 adults fly 1120 km to Harare return, 1.5 adults can fly return to Bangkok or Europe (3 or more meals, drinks, snacks and luggage and other niceties included with a distance exceeding 10 x or more further)\n\n- On check-in, the agent tried to force me to pay extra for excess luggage, and after redirecting me to another counter where staff merely assisted queue jumpers first, it turned out luggage was included in the ticket price paid after all;\n- On return, we booked a wheelchair for an elderly passenger, which never arrived. No explanation was given, and no effort was made to find somebody to help, despite other airlines' elderly passengers being assisted while we waited ;\n- The plane was delayed by +- 1.5 hrs, no adequate explanation given;\n- On arrival at Jhb (ORTIA) no wheelchair assistance was available to disembark or inside the airport - staff presumably went home or were sleeping\n\nFastjet operates both Airbus and Embraer ERJ-190's.

I booked a round trip flight from Dar to Kilimanjaro and never stepped foot on a FastJet plane because both flights were cancelled! They did not inform us on the cancellation via email or text. We found out when we got to the airport (thankfully we arrived super early), and a random airport worker asked us which flight we were on. We were informed that \"oh, FastJet usually cancel flights. You should check with the desk to see if it's still going.\" It was not. We were then put on a Precision Air flight that was scheduled to leave an hour later than the original FastJet. Thankfully we got a seat on the Precision flight, but many of the other FastJet customers did not. Okay, part one of the FastJet wasn't *too* bad. But now buckle up for part two.\n\nOn the return trip to Dar, we drove 1.5 hour to JRO from Arusha. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early (just to be safe again). Surprise, surprise, we found out that--even though we had a booked and PAID for seats on the flight--we were kicked off the flight...along with 20 other customers who also booked and paid for seats. Apparently, FastJet cancelled a flight the day before and booked all those passengers on our flight. Again, there was *zero* communication regarding this update. Unfortunately, all the other airlines were either full or charging way too much (~$350 USD for a one-way ticket from JRO-->DAR, which is one-hour flight) for a ticket. FastJet's solution? Put on us the same flight tomorrow. After complaints from many other upset customers, FastJet finally gave everyone some accommodation and transportation money to make up for their error. This wasn't possible for us since we needed to be in Dar that evening. We later found out that FastJet was lying about the flight, and it was actually cancelled. We ended up driving 1.5 hour back to Arusha and went straight to the FastJet offices and asked for refund. They said they would issue a refund (but demanded us to give back the transportation money they originally gave us...). She said we should see the refund within 10-15 business days. It has been a whole month and we have yet to see any refund. We ended up getting a flight from Arusha airport with FlightConnection and it cost around $160 USD since it was so last minute.\n\nTLDR: Don't book with FastJet. They have a reputation of cancelling flights and not refunding their customers. Not sure how that's legal, but that's the case. I recommend booking with Precision Air or Air Tanzania instead.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sengupta2010","crvsd":"sengupta2010 wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"sengupta2010","default":"Washington DC, District of Columbia","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r548618626-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Don't book with FastJet (unless you want ALL your flights cancelled...)","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It was cancelled and we were put on a later flight that day. Then that flight was cancelled and we were put on a 6pm flight. We were told this the night before our flight.\nThis meant we missed our ongoing flight to Zanzibar. Luckily Auric Air let us change our ongoing flight at a small cost. But the next flight was in the morning so we were stranded in Dar Es Salaam. Before our flight we called Fast Jet’s customer services and they were not helpful at all. We were told to speak to someone when we arrived at the airport in Dar. As two young girls we thought it was a terrible and dangerous decision as we were arriving in Dar late at night. Luckily, at the airport we complained and complained until they agreed to put us up in a hotel for the night. They arranged transport to the hotel and back to the airport in the morning. So they did redeem themselves. But all of this caused us a lot of stress and worry and we lost money from our ongoing flight. The customer services department should have been able to help us and organise our hotel when we originally called them.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/85/8b/4c/hayley-mortimer.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hayley_Mortimer","crvsd":"Hayley_Mortimer wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"Hayley_Mortimer","default":"Bristol, United Kingdom","phmbo":"37 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kilimanjaro National Park - Dar es Salaam","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r547352163-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Avoid this airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On arriving to the airport, after 8 hours of flights from Cape Town to Dar es Salaam, we were told unapologetically that the flight was cancelled and we would have to fly at 11 AM the next day.\n\nAfter not taking \"no\" for an answer for a few hours, we eventually booked a different flligt on Air Tanzania (paid cash last minute at the airport) and are currently in the process of waiting on a refund we've been told will be issued within 7 working days. I'm not convinced, and have been calling the contact center to to try to move things forward.\n\nWe also had booked a FastJet flight later this week out of Kilimanjaro, but have now booked a 2nd flight on a different airline. FastJet says they can't refund that upcoming flight because \"we don't know yet if there will be a problem; if there is a problem we will let you know, for now it's your personal decision to cancel.\"\n\nI suspect FastJet often cancels the last flight of the day on the day-of if it isn't full enough.\n\nI feel bad for other folks on our flight who didn't get to the airport five hours early and have time to make alternate arrangements. I imagine they weren't able to get FastJet to help, and so likely lost a day; hopefully didn't miss their safari!\n\nI would highly recommend Air Tanzania for transfer from Dar to Kilimanjaro, by the way. Very friendly and efficient service; we would have been stranded without them. Seems to be just as affordable as FastJet as well.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/47/22/88/daniel-h.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielH775","crvsd":"Daniel H wrote a review Nov 2017","ui_header_link":"Daniel H","default":"","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r543507024-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Avoid traveling FastJet unless you're ok with last-minute cancellation","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The departing flight was moved until two days later and the returning flight one day. Unable to fit the changes into my schedule, I cancelled the flight.\n\nUnlike most airlines, I couldn't make arrangements over the phone to receive my refund. Instead, I had to go into one of the airline's offices, where I was told to fill out a refund form.\n\n\"Why can't I get my cash now?\" I asked. The clerk told me that the airline can only issue refunds in the manner that the ticket was purchased. Since I purchased the flight with a debit card, I could only receive a refund by having the money deposited into my checking account.\n\nI wasn't impressed, but Africa has its share of bureaucracy. I filled out the form.\n\n\"You'll get your refund in 5-7 business days,\" the clerk assured me. I had my doubts.\n\nAfter 10 business days without a refund, I recalled the office. \"The refund is in the pipeline,\" the clerk said. \"I will call you back.\"\n\nSilence for a week.\n\nBe careful about anything Fastjet tells you. There's a strong possibility it's not true.\n\nAfter 15 business days with no calls or a refund in sight, I contacted Fastjet again. Now I'd had enough, voicing my displeasure. Later that night, I received my first return call from Fastjet in 15 days. A clerk told me that I could pick up my refund at the office. I said I'd get it that weekend.\n\nNot quite believing the news, I called again the next day (Day 16 without a refund). The operator didn't seem to know about my refund, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The manager said she would look into my situation and return my call.\n\nSilence.\n\nOn Day 17 without a refund, it was obvious that Fastjet's customer service was incompetent. Instead, I managed to track down contact information for the company's CEO.\n\nTo his credit, the Fastjet CEO – Nico Bezuidenhout – actually passed along my information to the upper echelon of corporate management.\n\nOn Day 18, I received a lengthy email from the company's general manager of sales, confirming that I'd be able to pick up my cash. Still being skeptical, I asked for clarity on how to do so. I had visions of yet another clerk not knowing what I was talking about.\n\nThe next morning (Day 19 without a refund) the general manager indicated in an email that the matter was still being investigated, rather than telling me how to pick up the money.\n\nThe email said, \"The internal investigation thus far is pointing towards the refund having been processed by NMB on the 12th Oct (see attached). In the meanwhile, your refund remains in question as you have indicated, and wish to have feedback provided by tomorrow. Thank you for your continued patience.\"\n\nIf you ever have a complaint with Fastjet, you will encounter numerous operators telling you how sorry they are for your problem and to be patient. That is all you will get – excuses, delays, and patronizing replies.\n\nFinally, the next day, the skies cleared (Day 20 without a refund). As I'd done each morning for three weeks, I checked my bank account. My refund had suddenly appeared.\n\nI was promised my refund would take 5-7 business days. Instead, it took 20 (27 days, if you include weekends).\n\nWhen I purchased a ticket on Fastjet, I knew I was dealing with a budget airline, but even a budget airline can deliver decent customer service.\n\nMy first experience with Fastjet will be my last. The best advice I can offer potential customers is buyer beware. If you still want to risk it, be prepared for cancellations and a litany of excuses, if you ever need a refund.\n\nAvoid the airline at all costs.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/86/be/ed/markcolin.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkColin","crvsd":"MarkColin wrote a review Oct 2017","ui_header_link":"MarkColin","default":"United States","phmbo":"80 contributions","phmbo1":"92 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Harare - Dar es Salaam","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r536362129-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Airline of Cancellations and Broken Promises","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

First of all it took over an hour to check in Lusaka as the procedure is for check in staff to make a photocopy of your credit card which you used to book the airticket.

As a result of the delay we missed our pre-paid ferry to Zanzibar and had to book a flight. Already money lost! On the way back to Lusaka, some passengers in our group received an e-mail a few hours before we were supposed to take off that our flight had been postponed by 4 days! We had to book a new ticket with Kenya Airways which cost us another $400 with an 8 hour layover in Nairobi. This trip turned into a very expensive trip thanks to Fast Jet. What an unreliable airline. Either way we would have had to forfeit money at a hotel or a new airticket on a different airline. Next time we will pay the higher price for guaranteed service with Kenya airways or South African Airways to Zanzibar. No one has replied to any of our e-mails to the company which just goes to show they are an unreliable airline.

Fastjet should however re-look flight Timings to ensure Tourists gain advantage & optimize flying times (just as an example we arrived From Harare to Dar es Salaam, but we had to wait for 5 hrs for our connecting flight to Kili ,wasting time at Dar Es Salaam airport, thereby loosing most part of our day flying into Kili, loosing a full day stay in Kili (such time wasted is a major loss for Holiday makers like us who want to make the best of our holiday time).\nWe travelled Fastjet twice in a week, since our Air Zimbabwe return flight from Vic Falls was cancelled, we had to choose Fastjet again from Vic Falls airport for our return flight to Harare.\nBaggage allowance is low, Also there is extra charges for checked in baggage.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/2f/64/db/muralidhara-n.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muralidhara2013","crvsd":"Muralidhara N wrote a review Sep 2017","ui_header_link":"Muralidhara N","default":"Gurgaon","phmbo":"1052 contributions","phmbo1":"67 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Harare - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r522895968-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Reputed Airline, Seems to have good Africa Coverage","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We arrived late to the airport due to a late connecting flight and I had put my phone in the front pocket of my backpack which I intended to carry on the plan. After about 10 minutes waiting in line and then chatting with the agent, they claimed that my backpack needed to be checked. It was just a small laptop bag so I was a bit confused but ended up giving them the bag and checking it in. Within a few minutes, I realized I had forgot to remove my phone from the checked bag. I returned to the gate agent, asked to see my bag (I could literally see it behind the desk) and she refused to let me have it. Upon arriving in Kilimanjaro I opened my bag and my phone was gone. I attempted to report it stolen to the fastjet agent but he refused to write a report because phones are not supposed to be in checked luggage. I then contacted fastjet online support who said they could not help me unless I had a report. Fastjet has refused to take any responsibility despite the fact that one of their staff (likely from Dar) stole my phone. They wouldn't confront the staff, refund my ticket, give me any type of credit. Nothing. I couldn't even file a report. It was overall an awful experience. Fastjet refusal to take any action has been extremely frustrating. I would not suggest this airline to any frequent travelers. Also, make sure you have locks on your bags or consider not checking any luggage. Do not let the gate agent convince you that a bag needs to be checked because you are allowed one personal item and one carry on.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477karif","crvsd":"Kari F wrote a review Mar 2017","ui_header_link":"Kari F","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r467123740-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Phone Stolen- No action taken by airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Arrived at check in with my family and was told my tickets had been cancelled - no warning, no explanation.  Was left in the lurch, had to pay more, and had to pay in cash - which I didn't have.  One staff member said we would get the difference refunded - but that was fiction.  After dozens of e mails, letter and calls I was told multiple lies and refused.  Would have taken the ferry if I knew what would happen.  Also since this time I was flying this airline on another route and they cancelled the flight twice over a period of 4 days.

We're both very busy so we cannot take more days of or travel on other days. We booked this months in advance.\n\nThen, last week I got the e-mail from Fastjet announcing that our returnticket has been changed from the 23th to the 20th. At this point, I was already very much disapointed (because: a 2-day honeymoon?! ... If I wanted to go away for just the weekend I would have stayed in SA) but Fastjet said it was the only option and by now, other tickets were already much more expensive so we couldn't afford anything else.\n\nTHEN this weekend I got another e-mail, saying the flight had been changed AGAIN. We would now depart on the 27th !!!!!! of November, ONE WEEK LATER! And there was not even a return ticket. This was just impossible for us, so we were forced to cancel the trip.\n\nUnfortunately, because of such a late notice from Fastjet, we cannot cancel the hotel reservations on Zanzibar anymore, which is R3000 lost. Customer Service declined my request for a refund of the money I lost because of THEIR incompetence (which, honestley, is not even close to compensating the DISAPOINTMENT of not having the honeymoon we so much looked forward to).\n\nSo I would not recommend Fastjet to anyone; it looks like a good deal but in the end it can cost you a lot more. So please safe yourself the dissapointment.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annaaQ3765UK","crvsd":"annaaQ3765UK wrote a review Oct 2016","ui_header_link":"annaaQ3765UK","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r433217399-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Our flight got changed twice on very short notice so we needed to cancel our honeymoon","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were traveling to Zanzibar and wanted to continue to Port Elizabeth (over JNB) to do the garden route. Ergo, our entire planning was at the mercy of this flight that they offer twice per week.\n\nSix days before the flight, already on vacation, we were informed that the flight time changed from 8:30 to 18:20. We had to book another connection flight, a hotel for the stay (because we could not continue the same day) and missed a stay in a guesthouse in PLZ.\n\nI sent an inquiry to customer service and I was honestly surprised that they answered: they referred me to their TOS (which says they don't refund anything) and told me that they advise their passengers to use a travel insurance.\n\nThe flight itself naturally did not take off on time (it was around 30 min late) and it was not even carried out by fastjet but by a sub-contractor (star airline or similar). A woman sitting next to me payed for seats next to the emergency exit, but was seated somewhere else. The response to her complaint was: \"don't blame us: we are just the subcontractor\".\n\nAlso worth a look:\n[google for: fastjet delays and cancellations]\nQuote: Scheduled flight times may change between publication and the date of departure. fastjet do NOT guarantee flight times.\n\nEssentially, when you book with them, they don't guarantee specific flight times. The only thing they guarantee to you is that you may be able to fly with them (or some subcontractor) at some point in time if they have not gone out of business because of bad customer service by then.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2807PLandrea","crvsd":"Andre A wrote a review Oct 2016","ui_header_link":"Andre A","default":"Frankfurt, Germany","phmbo":"8 contributions","phmbo1":"10 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Zanzibar Island - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r431507270-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"travel insurance advised","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had read some mixed reviews but the price of the flights was too good to resist :) We flew from Dar Es Salaam to Zanzibar and then Dar to Kilimanjaro. Both times the plane was quite new and very comfortable. Snacks and drinks were available for purchase but our flights were so short we didn't bother. Both flights left on time and staff were professional and friendly.\n\nOne issue was our flight didn't show on the board at Dar airport, so we had to ask around and ended up at the wrong gate. So make sure you're clear about those details at the airport.\n\nAlso on the way to Zanzibar our check in agent was very particular about the weight of our baggage (19kg & 22kg for 20kg limit each). We worked it out and then pre-purchased another bag for the next flight before we flew but it wasn't a problem with that flight so I'm not sure if you need to. Overweight baggage can be charged on check in at USD4 per kg (I believe), and prepurchasing another bag costs USD10. I guess work out if that's worth it for you :)\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend and fly again!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucybD8104DH","crvsd":"lucybD8104DH wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"lucybD8104DH","default":"","phmbo":"30 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Zanzibar Island","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r411318871-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Very good budget option","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

With that said, the airplane on both flights I took was clean, well maintained and the staff in the aircraft were polite and professional.\n\nOn the ground, my experience was unfortunately a different story. My flight from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam at 7:50 am was cancelled; I did not get their “email notice” as I was on another red eye flight from Canada. As such, I sat in the Nairobi airport from 2:00am until 6:50am waiting to check in for my flight – there was no sign at the fastjet checkin desk to notify of a flight cancellation, so it wasn’t until I went to the ticket counter that I found this out.\n\nDue to this, I missed my connecting flight (also a fast jet flight) from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza. (FYI: When I later read the email, the subject line did not caption ‘urgent itinerary change, or flight cancellation’ which could mislead others to skip over the email; it only said please review your flight itinerary, which happened to show a different departure time... so if you do use this airline, make sure to check your email 24 in advance for confirmation or a cancellation notice).\n\nRegardless of the flight cancellation and missing my connecting flight (because I know these things do happen), my issue with Fast Jet was with the airline’s lack of policy surrounding how to accommodate passengers in these situations and the lack of training for ground staff (i.e. ticket counter) to respond with adequate customer service.\n\nCase in point: Since the next Fast Jet flight we could get on was 14 hours later, myself and a few other passengers requested a food voucher OR access to an airport lounge OR a hotel accommodation so we could eat and rest; I didn’t care what they were able to provide, I just did not want to sit at the terminal for 14 hours. As a frequent traveler, I know this is standard procedure for other airlines to accommodate passengers when they make a significant itinerary change -- after all, it wasn’t our fault they cancelled our flight.\n\nThe girl at the ticket booth resisted at first, stating it was our fault we did not see the email they sent notifying us to come later. It took 4 hours of going back and forth to figure out how to proceed…during this time, I had to get behind the desk to use her laptop so I could browse alternative flight options and prices for her. They decided that booking us a sooner flight out on another airline was too expensive, so eventually they did book us a hotel in Nairobi with transport (and I honestly sincerely appreciate this!!! It was a really nice hotel with lunch included)…but it took 4 hours of negotiation and 1 hour of waiting for the taxi to get to this point. By the time I got to the hotel, I only had a few hours to sleep before we got picked up again to go back.\n\nThe girl at the ticket desk had also informed me that the best plan to get my connecting flight to Mwanza re-booked would be to arrive in Dar es Salaam and go to their ticket counter. She explained that since it departed from Dar, it needed to be reissued from Dar; she also said this office was open 24 hours.\n\nNot surprisingly, I flew into Dar at 11:30pm and the ticket office was closed. I sat on the floor of the airport until 4:00am when the Fast Jet Ticket office opened - the lady there informed me she could not reissue my ticket and I would need to purchase another one. I was trying to explain my situation so she could understand that it was not my fault I missed my connecting flight and in fact it was Fast Jet’s cancellation that caused me to miss it, but she began to yell at me.\n\nThankfully she sent me to talk to another woman from Swissport (Fast Jet’s ground service representatives) and she issued me another ticket (free of charge) without a second thought. The staff at the FastJet checkin and baggage drop off (who were also Swissport staff as per their uniforms) were polite and efficient; I was able to get on board the next flight without issues after this and as mentioned earlier, the flight experience was good.\n\nI am not sure why there is such a drastic difference of conduct with the ticket counter staff, but it seems the lack of clear policy in these situations has caused no continuity of customer service on the ground. Although I am very appreciative that I had received the hotel accommodation while in Nairobi, I must admit I was disappointed that it took 5 hours to access. I was also troubled by how I was given incorrect information regarding my layover in Dar and how poorly I was treated by Dar’s ticket office agent, especially when she could see I was tired and upset. Because of this, I will probably not use Fast Jet again.\n\nI would not recommend this airline to you if you have a connecting flight. I would only recommend Fast Jet if you are flexible with your travel plans and willing to chance that your flight could be cancelled for an extended period of time.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/98/9b/6d/steph-h.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephH358","crvsd":"Stephanie wrote a review Jul 2016","ui_header_link":"Stephanie","default":"London, Canada","phmbo":"28 contributions","phmbo1":"14 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Mwanza","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r392815840-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Use with Caution:","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were directed to FastJet, and they were more than happy to accommodate us (requiring us to purchase NEW tickets).  We were happy they had seats, and we agreed to pay the $185/person so that we were not stranded.  However, when we handed them the credit card, they informed us they required cash.  We began digging through bags to find enough cash, and just made it.  They then handed back 2 $20 bills, stating that they all had to be dated after 2006.  Luckily, we were able to find enough money to cover it.  Other than that, which was stressful, FastJet was lovely.  The flight boarding was organized, plane was clean, staff was friendly, and baggage delivered in a timely fashion.  Overall, in the future, I will book FastJet to start with (hopefully using a credit card online!).","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/02/94/ca/beth-b.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962bethb","crvsd":"Beth B wrote a review Jul 2016","ui_header_link":"Beth B","default":"Palo Alto, California","phmbo":"48 contributions","phmbo1":"46 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dar es Salaam - Mwanza","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8728924-r389232852-Fastjet-World.html","qwuub":"Excellent flight; required cash!","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
