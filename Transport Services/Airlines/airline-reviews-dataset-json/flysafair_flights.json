Several South African low-cost airlines operate on the route. This, in turn, lowered prices to a completely acceptable level. Having an extremely sad experience with AirLink, I chose this South African low-cost airline with brightly colored planes. This is a kind of South African Ryanair, but somewhat more expensive (maybe because I took tickets on the day of departure). There is no food, no drinks either. I didn't see any heartbreaking scenes with luggage in calibrators either. Maybe lucky? But they flew out on time, they arrived too. That's the main thing.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/07/5f/8d/vadimm67.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VadimM67","crvsd":"Vadim wrote a review Oct 2022","ui_header_link":"Vadim","default":"Murmansk, Russia","phmbo":"24614 contributions","phmbo1":"3533 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r866749237-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"South African low-cost airline with bright coloring.","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Utterly disgraceful and humiliating service from all staff members of FlySafair at boarding gate NAMELY - VALENCIA. This is Mohamed. I was taking the 21:40pm flight from Dur - Jnb (OR TAMBO) and i checked in online 24 hours before. I received my seat number and boarding pass via email and was clearly aware that the boarding gate closes 15 minutes prior which was 21:25pm. I was coming from Umhlanga and there was construction on the road - altought there was major traffic and delays - i knew i checked in online and just had to get to the boarding gate. I arrive inside the airport at 21:20 and i was boarding at gate A14 which was a 30 second run from the security gate. I knew i had a minute or two so i ran along with my sister who was travelling with me and reached in under 30 seconds which means i was there at 21:25 on the dot. Infront of me was the staff named Valencia (an african lady) who was escorting a standby passenger into the boarding gate and i was probably roughly around 2-3 feet behind her. She clearly heard me running yet walked into the gate and shut the door. I pleaded to her that i was right here at 21:25 on the dot and that i was just behind her so why cannot i be let in. She told me they have already taken standby passengers so i informed her how can you take standby passengers when booked passengers like my sister and i - are already here and on top of it all , we are ON TIME / JUST ON TIME. It does not make any sense. She continued to revoke me and i raised my voice because this was the last flight of the night , it was a SUNDAY and i have work the next day in JNB. She used language words on me such as “JWAYELANI” and since i am brought up in KZN , i clearly know the meaning of it and this is disgraceful that safair can have crew of this nature working for them. I wrote my matric final exams 5 years ago and on my final paper i was on the last question and the government examiner noticed this and gave me 2 more minutes to complete my paper. But this is not the case because i was JUST ON TIME. I am stating this because if even i was a minute or 2 late - this is not acceptable that situations cannot be understoof. If i was there 5-10 minutes after gate closed and planes doors are closed - that is a different situation. By taking standby passengers it means they are still processing passenger and that the plane door is still open. How were standby passengers already being processed at 21:25 when the boarding gates just closed and we were there. The only difference was they were taken inside but not us. This is not justifiable at all that i have to miss opening my business and loose my customers of the day because Valencia AND TEAM was so negligent in doing their part and understanding that i am on time and i am here so how can preference be given to a standby customer. A short indian lady from the boarding gate came to explain to me why they not allowing me and that im late took 5-7 minutes to explain and justify herself when she can take 15 seconds and process both my sister and i. This is disgraceful and i had to pay R300 for me and R300 for my sister to be put at a 6:15am flight as a STANDBY. Which means at this point writing this email i do not even know if i will get on the flight and make it on time because i still have to travel 200km from JNB airport to my home in North West. I WANT VIDEO FOOTAGE AND SURVEILLANCE AS I CLEARLY SAW A CAMERA ALL OVER THE PLACE TO BE SEEN THAT I WAS THERE ON TIME WITH MY SISTER. AND ALSO THE LEVEL OF TREATMENT THAT WE WERE GIVEN. If you want to continue being my trusted airline provider , i want a full refund and to be compensated for my loss of income for the day that i will be running arround for standby flights and not have my business opened due to lack of mentality of staff of FlySafair. This is non-negotiable and i will take this further up if necessary. This is a money making scheme as those people have now paid for our seats and you made douboe the money. And to top it all you charge is R300 for nothing. We are only forced to pay because this matter cannot be handled in-house and needs to be taken up via email. And we need to get home. I trust we can come to an understanding and that flysafair can understand and view evidence as evidence is clearly available as to what time we arrived at the gate. I will not let this matter rest. I look forward to an urgent response from the team of FlySafair.\n\nRegards,\nMohamed - 067 868 3175\nFlight information: 8AEMT9 - DURBAN TO OR TAMBO JOHANNESBURG - 21:50pm departure and 2 passengers.\n\nNEW UPDATE: 96 hours (4 days) - no response from flysafair help email.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/furqanmoosa","crvsd":"Mohamed Furqan Moosa wrote a review Sep 2022","ui_header_link":"Mohamed Furqan Moosa","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Durban - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r862509338-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Disgusting Service. humiliating Service","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We recently booked business class with safair for a combination of these reasons and were utterly disappointed. Travelling on FA 286 on the 19th August from ORT to King Shaka and on FA 283 on the 21st August for the return route: some staff were rude, unhelpful, offensive, and apparently ignorant of the service offering. There were zero benefits gained for the extra fees other than the front row seat - which is no big deal as it does not even have place to put small items when in travel.  The waste of money is the big issue but this could all have been avoided if 1) Safair don't pretend to offer a business class service when they cant fulfill on that or 2) Safair simply offered economy class only and manage expectations accordingly. My strong advice is don't take their business class offering - its not worth it at all.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7240HCandys","crvsd":"Andy S wrote a review Aug 2022","ui_header_link":"Andy S","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Durban - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r855693608-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"FlySafair not geared to offer business class","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

After about 20 minutes of boarding and no departure, the captain announced that there was a technical issue with the aircraft and that the engineers are working on it and we should be ready to go within 15 minutes.\n\nAn hour had then passed and there was still no take off. The captain then announced that it would be another 15 minutes and it was a small issue with the aircons only and once filters were changed, the plane would be good to go.\n\nAfter 2 hours stuck on the plane, crew allowing no one off (holding us like hostages) on a plane filled to capacity of nearly 150 people with no aircons on (under covid circumstances), we requested waters from the cabin crew, who simply ignored our numerous requests.\n\n\n\nAfter the 2 hours stuck on the plane, the captain announced that the flight was ready to go and the engineers signed off the paperwork.\n\nOn departure, whilst on the runway, it was simply clear to the passengers that the plane was not receiving enough power to basically take off the run way. Any normal person could tell this. The pilot however, at his own discretion ( or advice from SAFair) decided to fly the aircraft anyway, knowing the risks.\n\n\n\nAs a frequent flyer, I am fully aware, as are others, at the rate that an aircraft it suppose to gain altitude etc.\n\nHowever, 10 minutes into the flight, the plane was cruising at a really low altitude, where peoples houses, cars and road ways were still clearly visible from the aircraft. This was already a concern as it was quite noticeable that the aircraft was no longer ascending/gaining further altitude.\n\n\n\nThe Pilot then called cabin crew to the cockpit which was clearly an emergency. Passengers were now aware that there was an issue.\n\n\n\nThe Pilot announced about 15 minutes into the flight that there was another technical issue with the aircraft and that it was not gaining pressure and that if we continued with the flight, we would not make it to the destination (JHB to Durban) as we would run out of fuel.\n\nA few minutes later, he announced that we would need to make an emergency landing that would occur within 5 minutes, that all passengers must take the brace position and follow the crews instruction to disembark one the aircraft was grounded.\n\n\n\nThis caused distress amongst the passengers as the aircraft was not near any safe landing spots.\n\n\n\nThe pilot , somehow, managed to get the aircraft back to OR Tambo and thankfully landed the plane safely.\n\n\n\nThere was no need to cause such panic and distress to passengers.\n\n\n\nUpon landing, again, a considerable period of time passed and they did not allow anyone off the aircraft, let alone offer a bottle of water…knowing that there are children and elderly people on the flight. No communication was put forward to advise passengers of what was happening.\n\n\n\nOnce they eventually let everyone off the plane, around 11pm, they loaded the 150 odd people on merely 2 busses at the airport (again, under covid circumstances and locked the bus doors) and held us on the bus for nearly an hour, with no communication to the passengers once again.\n\n\n\nThey eventually advised just after 11pm that they have arranged an alternative plane. At this point, after the trauma and considering the time of night, many passengers, including myself refused to get onto another flight after the traumatic experience caused by the pure blatant negligence of the Fly SAfair crew and pilot. They decided to risk peoples lives knowingly!\n\n\n\nThere was no one for loved ones to contact in an emergency situation at FLY SAfair, not at the call center nor at the service desks at the airport.\n\n\n\nWhen I called Fly SAfair on 22/06/2022 at around 9.20am and requested a refund, they advised that since “we got onto the flight, they would not refund the money” and Keven Scheepers confirmed that “it was not that bad.” Again, pure disregard for people, the trauma caused by the airline, and the inconvenience caused by them, let alone the risk that they placed peoples lives in. I requested to speak to a manager and was advised that a Thuli would contact me “WHEN SHE HAS TIME”, a call that I still await.\n\n\n\nI would advise anyone looking to use this airline not to do so. They have complete disregard for safety. The crew, pilots, call center agents are all of no assistance whatsoever! This situation could have been avoided as it was clear as day that the aircraft was not safe to fly, yet they took the chance.\n\n\n\nHope this helps someone when deciding to use this airline!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saeomaj","crvsd":"Saeoma Duttoo wrote a review Jun 2022","ui_header_link":"Saeoma Duttoo","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lanseria - Durban","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r843978679-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"DISREGARD FOR SAFETY BY FLYSAFAIR","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We arrived over an hour prior to our flight only to be made to stand in the check-in queue for approx 45 minutes while they helped on customer in front of us for that entire duration. We got to the front of the queue only to be told that our flight was full. When we enquired about how that was possible and why we were sold tickets in a full flight we were simply told that we should have arrived at the airport earlier (which makes absolutely no sense as to why our flight was over booked). We were then told to pay an extra R300 each in order to be booked on a later flight which would leave at 17:50 (so we had to wait from morning until 17:50 to see if we could get on that flight). When the time finally came, only one seat was available on that flight and the remaining people had to take the next morning's flight. It is completely unethical that Flysafair allowed my family to buy tickets on a full flight because had they been honest with their customers that flights were full alternative travel arrangements could have been made. They refused to give a refund under the guise of their policy that one is to arrive 1 hour 30 minutes before the flight time. The representatives had no remorse. We quickly discovered while waiting at the airport that we were not the only ones left destitute at the airport under similar circumstances by the airline. I would never recommend them nor use them again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onka13","crvsd":"Onka wrote a review Jun 2022","ui_header_link":"Onka","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Durban - Lanseria","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r843874387-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Mrs","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On top of that, whilst waiting in hopes of getting a seat, multiple passengers arrived late, some 15 minutes late and they were allowed through. I feel like I was treated unfairly and will avoid using Safair in the future at all costs. A once trusted brand has been tarnished in my opinion, complete lack of management/communication and a whole lot of favouritism.

We were incredibly happy with our entire flight. Check in going to Cape Town was smooth, we were actually a little late for boarding as the passengers boarded a little quicker than we 'time budgeted' for. The flight was smooth and bathrooms were in great conditions (even had a little flower in a vase on the basin, which is a cute touch). The flight included a complementary in-flight service where you could have something to drink and something small to nibble on. The flight attendants were friendly and accommodating and the pilots on both flights flew smoothly. The only thing that wasn't great was when checking-in bags on the flight back to Joburg. We waited about 45 minutes for check-in of bags to open. We were on time but the airline was late, so we had to rush dinner before boarding.

They will return your luggage damaged, and then wipe their hands of the situation by sending you an email saying what happens to the baggage is out of their control because it has to -- and I quote directly the nonsense they sent me -- \"pass through the hands of several service providers in the airport context.\"\n\nParticularly don't recommend them if you are travelling with children (in my case, two small children) -- they damaged my child's car seat so as to make it completely unuseable. They literally damaged the one part that says DO NOT REMOVE. They then said I could no longer make a claim once I had stepped out of the airport. No, you did not read that wrong -- apparently after a long flight (that didn't leave on time), you are expected to then traipse around a large airport and track down their lost luggage office which is nowhere to be found, while dragging along two small, tired children, in order for them to believe you're not making this up (who has the time?!?) and yes, they really did damage your toddler seat. As any parent knows, it's already stressful travelling with children, and FlySafair will only make it worse.\n\nThey claim reporting directly at their (invisible) lost luggage office is for \"transparency\" reasons, when actually transparency on their part would have been them telling you they can't be trusted to safely check in a car seat.

We initially used 1 computer to book for us 5 and per person it ended being OVER +-R100 which DOESN\"T MAKE SENSE. So we ended up using 2 laptops to book (2 adults and 3 adults separately) and paid extra +-R300 for my bro and his friends.\n\nYes, it was my bro's fault for not checking the email confirmation within an hour after receiving it but because my bro has an account with Flysafair and hes been a loyal to the brand, he thought everything was in order until... he checked his email the day after around 1am which rolled over to the next day (today). So when I called the customer service agent, P**tia was assisting me over the phone. When I explained the situation that there was a system error, (me and my bf are on the 17:55 flight, my bro and his party 09:25 flight) as my bro and his party were supposed to be on the 17:55 with us but somehow him and his party got put on the 09:25 flight (We have screenshots of the booking summary stating this), P**tia cut me off and started EACH sentence with, \"Unfortunately....\" she INTERRUPTED me while I was explaining and ALL she said was, \"Unfortunately...\" like a robot with NO HUMAN FEELINGS. As if ALL Flysafair agents are trained like a robot. She didnt let me finish and I got angry and asked her to let me finish speaking. I was livid at this point as I had to keep repeating only for her to \"unfortunately\" me without even listening to the entire thing!!!!\n\nI must say, I did apologize to her first for raising my voice as I was frustrated with, \"unfortunately\" and getting cut off middle sentence and she DID NOT ONCE apologize. She even put me on loud speaker for her colleagues to listen and was talking to her colleagues whilst I was explaining. I mean,.... WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS????!\n\nWe acknowledge that we didnt check the email immediately, I asked her if there was anything that she can advise us to do. She didnt want to listen and kept saying, \"Unfortunately you have to pay the flight difference and penalty fee.\" So for the 3 of them, Flysafair wanted to charge R1500. I explained again, when you book for people over 2, they will charge you EXTRA +-R100 per person and P**tia replied with, \"it is possible...\" I told her, \" No, its not possible, it is a fact! I can show you the confirmation you charge MORE for doing 1 transaction if the number of passengers are more than 2\"\n\nAnyway, I eventually said ok to the penalty fee of R300pp but asked if she could waive the flight ticket difference and she said AGAIN, \"Unfortunately\" ...\n\nI am UTTERLY disgusted with the lack of compassion P**tia has, I dont know if all other Flysafair agents are like this or just her. I feel INJUSTICE!!\n\nMoral of the story, DONT BOOK AT FLYSAFAIR IF YOU ARE BOOKING FOR MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE!!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339chiayuc","crvsd":"Chiayu C wrote a review Dec 2021","ui_header_link":"Chiayu C","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"East London - Johor Bahru","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r822925866-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Incompassionate, Rude, Injustice!","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Now, THREE weeks later after submitting countless requests with the bank, airline and travel agency I sit R1726 less than what is owed to me. Who can I contact to resolve this issue before I result to a lawsuit????\nThere are no words to express my frustration.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micaelabotha1","crvsd":"Micaela Botha wrote a review Dec 2021","ui_header_link":"Micaela Botha","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - George","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r821974755-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"NEVER use eDreams, Not even to VIEW a ticket!","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The other two babies were in highly recommended special car seats strapped to a carseat trolley. When we got to the door of the aircraft they greeted us with “Those baby seats are not allowed on this plane, they have to go into the luggage compartment”, there was NO “Good morning ma’am how can we help, we would just like to inform you that the baby seats are not allowed to go onto this aircraft, but lets quickly get you settled in and then those baby seats could be moved to the luggage compartment.

Again the cabin crew insisted that we need to remove the babies from the chair by the door, my friend then pleaded and said we have our hands full we aren’t able to carry the babies in in our arms because our hands are full. This specific air hostess then turns to me(who was holding the nappy bags, our jackets, 6 boarding passes and 6 Passports) and said do you want to tell me you can’t hold a baby? Firstly if she did what she was getting paid to do, she would be a little more helpful and less sarcastic....otherwise why even have cabin crew Safair.  What does their job entail??We were then informed that we had to switch our phones to airplane mode.  Which we happily did.When the aircraft started taking off - the passenger in 2E’s cellphone started ringing.  It stopped ringing.  Then it started ringing again. And it went on like this for the entire take off until the aircraft was in the air.  The cabin crew who EASILY told us what to do and how to do it with a sarcastic tone in their voices could not address the passenger in 2E and ask him to switch his phone to airplane mode—NO SHE SAT in her seat and just watched him do his own thing.  The other passengers had to tell him to switch his phone to airplane mode to avoid interference with the flight. Not sure if he actually ended up doing it. But what was extremely frustrating was that the air hostesses(cabin crew) weren’t being helpful in any way with us, they could easily address us but wouldn’t address other passengers who WERENT traveling with babies. We added priority boarding to our flight package to ensure that we were settled before the other passengers entered, so we didn’t hold up anyone. When it was finally time to unfastened our seat belts for landing the air hostesses told us that we can move out and they’ll bring our carry on luggage. By this time of the flight majority of the surrounding passengers were polite, friendly and understanding knowing of the little one out of the three’s heart condition (including the air hostesses) As soon as the aircraft stopped my friend(seated in 2C)got up to put her baby strap back onto her abdomen in order to put her little fragile baby back into it. So the passenger in 2E gets up and tried to push passed her in order to leave and nearly knocked over my friend and her baby into the aisle(who she was holding and trying to strap back into his carry on)her and her baby could have been seriously injured—my friend then turned around flustered/tired and fought with this passenger saying could he just be a little more considerate he can see that she is busy strapping in her baby to secure him. The air hostesses were at the time laughing with one of the passengers in front of them, instead of ensuring that the passengers were leaving in an orderly fashion. The air hostesses saw what was happening but didn’t say a word to this same passenger.  When my friend turned to tell the passenger that he was being inconsiderate—the one air hostess next to me in the aisle (seated right behind my friend in 3D) laughed at the situation——what the hell???? Is it not her job to sort out passengers that behave in this manor?????? Is it not their job to ensure safe/comfortable disembarking for Safair passengers????? They were unprofessional and useless.  I was so disgusted with the service we received today right from the check-in counter to boarding and to then flying.   We received terrible service and I will NEVER book with Safair again. Their staff members are so blatantly unaware of their job description.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unhappypassenger_202","crvsd":"Unhappy passenger wrote a review Jul 2021","ui_header_link":"Unhappy passenger","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Durban","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r796483116-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Worst cabin crew EVER!!!!!!!","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I couldn't believe safair didn't communicate any changes of arrangements for their customers desperately trying to get home. Despite the confusing, stressful and difficult task of trying to navigate my way between missing luggage and impossible timing, I had to get to another airport to catch a later flight. The lack of communication from Safair was deafening. Did I not receive my boarding pass via whatsapp? Could they not have notified me of anuy delays (6Hours!)and subsequent changes to my arrangements to get home safely? I was very disappointed. (Safair found fault with the initial flight.  Which was fine, as I appreciate the safety checks on the planes before boarding.) Then I overheard (coincidentally) safiar would send another plane. This plane was ALSO not able to board for some reason. Why did they not COMMUNICATE the issue with the passangers? According to AJ which I had a long conversation with over Facebook Messanger, they accommodated passangers. They had ten seats  available on the 'alternative arrangement flight'. So, in theory, they had made arrangements for only ten passangers. Not acceptable.  I would have been happy If Safair had simply let us KNOW what was going on. Would not recommend.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vdwesa","crvsd":"Vdwesa wrote a review Jun 2021","ui_header_link":"Vdwesa","default":"Knysna, South Africa","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lanseria - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r794215577-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Astounding lack of communication and don't - care attitude","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Had booked tickets in April of last year but due to Covid we could not make use of it. We then opted to utilize our tickets this year May and flight rebooking was done in March 2021.\nWe arrived at airport early, did online check in as not to waste any valuable time and waited for our flight departing at 13:45 on Friday 21/05.\nWe arrived at gate at 13:34 and at that point are told that boarding has closed.\nStaff were still at gate and in the attempt to ask them to please allow us in, they state that gates close at 13:35 (during the attempt to get them to let us in, it was now 13:36).\nComplete refusal to allow us in however it took another 15 to 20min for airline to remove our luggage from flight.\n\nWe were then forced to\n1. Pay R2000 more for a later flight at 19:30\nNow Plse note that we witnessed first hand at the 19:30 flight that your boarding commenced earlier than stipulated and that your staff took it upon themselves to stand behind “last passenger” to begin closing boarding. At that point we stepped into line to join boarding so it’s clear that your staff is beginning boarding earlier and closing boarding earlier.\nHowever surprisingly, we sit in plan and it 19:20 and passengers are still being let in...\nWHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR 15min gates closed rule then???????\nShowing not all staff are adopting the same company policies and practices.\n\nWe than left to CT, had a wonderful 2 night stay but the dreaded Flysafair had a rear it’s ugly head once again on our depart.\nI had booked one bag for check in and that one one bag and one carry over was brought in to Ct from Dbn however on our return back to dbn we are told carry on is far too big and we would need to pay R250 for the bag.\nNow I would not have created a fuss had this policy been applied from dbn to ct as it would have been made aware to me then that this was company policy wrt size, however at your next branch I’m told something different and asked to dish out more hard earned money.\nTo make things worse, we see hoards of bags on our entry to plane kept aside and tagged as “too large” but those individuals were not asked to shell out R250 extra\nWHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR RULE wrt carry on luggage.\nShowing once again not all staff follow the same company policies and rules\n\nNow it’s extremely disappointing that a family hold us after 1.5years of not flying had to begin and end so disgustingly courtesy of Flysafair.\nYour costumer service leaves much to be desired for. Your staff are poorly trained and are clearly doing as they please\n\nAlso note, NO ANNOUNCEMENTS WRT BOARDING at King Shaka. We were told by your staff that there are signs everywhere notifying passengers of it being a “silent airport”. I did not see one such sign.\n\nUnfortunately the 2 flying experiences with Flysafair were enough and I will make every attempt to avoid flying your airline","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashPadayachee_","crvsd":"Tash Padayachee wrote a review May 2021","ui_header_link":"Tash Padayachee","default":"","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Durban - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r789628046-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Terrible service","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We received the email to confirm this. In our experience (even though the airline will deny it) We tried to check-in or add baggage to our existing flight and we unknowingly canceled our flight by licking back or apparently clicking \"get voucher\" which we did not click on ( even though the assistants claim this is impossible). Even if we did select get a voucher there were only 2 boxes to check either change flight or get a voucher. Apparently, we selected to get a voucher but the flight had to charge us a R300 admin fee because it was the government's fault for changing the flight and not theirs. WHAT RUBBISH!\n\nSo now I ended up paying R577 extra for a flight I already paid R1288 for !!!! Because they deducted the R300 admin fee and then when I went to rebook my flight it kicked me out of the system saying it was sold out but when I retried the price increased and was suddenly available.\n\nWhat a useless website!

I was very amped with my window seat (32F) and very happy as it was also on the second last row at the back of the plane which meant I’ll be one of the first guys out when the back door opens when we get to disembark to avoid the crowds with this whole covid thing!\nPassenger 32D arrived and then 32E! Yes ! 3 strangers in a 3 seater row! The intercoms announcing a reminder to please maintain 1.5m safe distancing between you and your fellow travelers as much as possible which is protocol obviously. But they place 3 single travelers in 1 row with NO social distancing not to mention the middle guy was huge too. I was squashed into the window and so was the opposite guy squashed into the walkway. The air hostesses walking by all chirpy and not even asking if passenger 32D or I was oky? Surely you could se we were sitting uncomfortably not to mention NO social distancing! The minute the seatbelt sign went off I got up and kindly asked one of the air hostesses if I could possibly move to the row behind me as it was completely open as there’s no social distancing in my row seats and the lady is like “no you can’t sit here, it’s only reserved for sick people, this row and the very first row”. I said oky, could you please take me then to a seat that’s available that has a open seat between me and a fellow passenger ? Just to get a snappy reply “ you can sit anywhere you want just not on these seats” so unhelpful !

FlySafair used to impress me. Now I will recommend Kulua, I never once had issue with them.\n\nBut this suitcase below, is a year old and has travelled across 15 countries and done 100s of hours of travel, but it could not survive a 2hr flight with Flysafair. When I went to complain to the baggage desk, they told me they don't cover wheels because they protrude from the bag, so despite rendering by bag useless with their carelessness, it's now my problem, and they'll recommend a place for me to get it fixed at my cost. Let it be known, this is not the first time I've had a baggage problem with FlySafair.\n\nFlysafair also operates under the illusion of being a low cost airline, by making you pay separately to put your luggage in the cargo hold, this additional fee can make the overall flight pricier, than other domestic carriers. Yet despite paying this additional fee, they can't make sure my baggage doesn't break??? Or offer repair?? I've had this issue in the past with British Airways, no question about how my handle broke, they reimbursed me immediately... but just a heads up, with FlySafair, a handle also counts as a protruding object. They may cover your bag being crushed by a dinosaur, but not the things that actually break.\n\nAlso this policy as mentioned above assures travellers, especially tourists, have no space in the overhead carriers for their hand luggage, because all the passengers don't want to pay the additional fee, and therefore try fit bags that clearly don't meet the weight and size requirement (this needs to be more regulated, it isn't) and take up all the space, and so you have backpacks stashed on your laps or the floor or the staff move your hand luggage to a different location, and as a result you have to be the last person getting off the plane, to get your bag.\n\nI am really disappointed.\nSpringbok sponsorship, does not guarantee a good quality flight or service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauren_sticky","crvsd":"Lauren Stuckenberg wrote a review Feb 2020","ui_header_link":"Lauren Stuckenberg","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Lanseria","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r747693070-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Service and cost.","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We checked-in and the flight departed on time and landed on-time in Cape Town at 20:58.

They were on time - living up to the accolades they received on both legs of the trip.\nMy only complaint is that the seats were a bit small. That said, I am over 1.85m in height so most seats are a problem for me :-(\n\nThe challenge for me though is that they charge you R30 for reserving your seat in advance else a seat will be automatically allocated to you, as per their website.\nFor me this process can be seen as a way to make more money, which I guess it is. They are running a business after all. The benefit however is that you do not have to diarise to make sure you do your online checkin to reserve your seat 24hrs before your flight.\nFor me it is the price of convenience which at R30 a person may just be worth it.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/a9/3c/02/avatar.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HungryRover","crvsd":"HungryRover wrote a review Nov 2019","ui_header_link":"HungryRover","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"28 contributions","phmbo1":"10 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r726079441-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Safair - on time, good service but charging for advanced checkin?","tehyy":"","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

September 2019 and I'm yet again waiting for a flight that has been delayed for 3 hours to late night. Some employees were quite nice, others completely indifferent and dismissive.

First experience with the airline and it was a pleasant one from start to finish.\n\nAs compared to other domestic airlines, FlySafair's website is incredibly user-friendly and visually appropriate. There is minimal lag between the different stages (pages) of booking and it is obvious that the website is well-maintained. Check-in online is swift and provides several options to access one's boarding pass.\n\nAs a first, I was taken aback by the service at the check-in counter. Never before have I been so warmly welcomed and sincerely assisted by a staff member at this stage of my journey. A highly commendable feat! I am happy to share that the rest of the FlySafair staff encountered along my journey also displayed good people and service delivery skills.\n\nThe aircraft itself was clean and lacked the musky stale undertones usually left behind from the previous cohort of passengers. Take-off was right on schedule and the flight itself was comfortable. If I am to provide a negative experience, it would have to be the on-board toilets. The magenta cistern is a site to behold. I hope one isn't left as traumatized as I was!\n\nI am delighted that my first flight with the airline was a positive one. I am most impressed with the strides, particularly information technologies, taken by the airline, making them a competitor not to be reckoned with. I look forward to the further growth and development of FlySafair.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChettyJ","crvsd":"JC_MD wrote a review Aug 2019","ui_header_link":"JC_MD","default":"","phmbo":"14 contributions","phmbo1":"17 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Durban - East London","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r704351121-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Pleasant Flying Experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Firstly they arrived late from Johannesburg at Cape Town  with a lame excuse that there was another plane in their way at Jhb International and that they could not take off. Then they checked in the new passengers and we still have to wait after that for the arriving passengers on the plane to depart the plane.  Then it felt like we are chased to get into the plane in order for them to depart on time. We were already late by then, but due to a strong tail wind we made it to Johannesburg just ahead of schedule. When we collect our luggage my colleague and I discovered that our suitcases were damaged.  The one wheel of her suitcase was totally broken off with some of her luggage sticking out. Tried to report it at the FLYSAFAIR Counter just to be told that it is already late and that we should e-mail them with a complaint. We both e-mailed a complaint and funny enough they alleged that they haven't received my complaint. I e-mailed it 3 times again and they still didn't receive it. My Colleague took my complaint and e-mailed it to exactly the same address and suddenly they got it. They promised to reimburse my Colleague R900 for her suitcase which she did not yet received. The fabric of my suitcase was torn and my suitcase was dented but they refused to reimburse me because it was only \"cosmetic\" damage. My suitcase was brand new and I am really disappointed and frustrated that and Airline that claims to be professional can damage your property and then claim that it was only \"cosmetic\" damage.  When I phoned to complain about this I was told that I should have taken out the insurance option on my luggage when booking the ticket which I did not knew about as I did not booked the ticket, but my Company did. I will never make use of this Airline again and advised my Company not to make use of them in future.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/d2/2b/59/izaks2016.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izaks2016","crvsd":"Izak wrote a review Jul 2019","ui_header_link":"Izak","default":"Germiston, South Africa","phmbo":"191 contributions","phmbo1":"44 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r689781413-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have been flying Flysafair as my airline of choice in South Africa ever since they started out a couple of years ago. They are always on time, make booking and boarding a pleasure, don't charge you for changing flights, their online booking site has one of the best user experiences of any airline, and their cabin crew are always pleasant and helpful. Previously I traveled Kulula, despite their irritating comedic profile, because they were a cheaper option than SAA or Mango (which is also SAA), but they became so unreliable and uncomfortable, and lost their price edge. Now it is great to be at the gate waiting to board another on-time Flysafair flight, and hearing the predictable announcement about lengthy delays to Kulula or Mango flights. Price: Flysafair is excellent, Kulula, Mango, SAA much pricier. Onboard comfort and seat space: Flysafair is roomier and more modern than any of them.  On-time departure: Flysafair has never been delayed in hundreds of flights I have had with them, the other airlines I came to expect delays as they were so typical. Ground crew and cabin crew attitude: Flysafair is warm welcoming and friendly, the others can be downright hostile. The only downside of Flysafair is that it has relatively few flights in the day (which may be why they are never late), but they are so good I am happy to adjust my schedule just to be able to fly with them.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/fb/4c/0b/gparkin.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/godfreyp263","crvsd":"Godfrey P wrote a review Jun 2019","ui_header_link":"Godfrey P","default":"Cape Town Central, South Africa","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lanseria - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r680970146-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"South Africa's most professional, reliable and pleasant airline","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The ground crew need a little more training and etiquette and their mannerisms when dealing with the public - sometimes it is a little difficult for foreigners to understand the ground crew as the language is not very clear.

For me, from now on it will always be Safair! What an awesome experience!\n\nMy husband and i fly at least twice a year, and have always used one of the other popular airlines. This time when I tried booking a couple of months ago, I could find nothing that suited my date or time,at a reasonable price. I was at my wits end as i did not want to spend so much on tickets. Looking around online to see if there werent any other options, I came across Safair. I didnt even know about such an airline, and at first thought it was a cargo plane. On lookinf further, I was surprised and thrilled to see seats were available for both the times and dates i wanted. And what was even more amazing was the fact that the price was half of what the other airlines were charging.\n\nBooking online was easy, and I was able to receive and print confirmation immediately. I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about our flight - was \"goedkoop\" going to be \"duurkoop\"........\n\nWell...... what a wonderful surprise! Check-in was effortless, staff were friendly and helpful, and boarding was on time. The flight itself was very pleasant - the flight attendants friendly and professional, as was the pilot. The plane itself was clean and in good condition. After landing, everything was waiting for us, so in no time, a matter of minutes, we were out of the plane and on our way to fetch our baggage. This too was ready and on the carousel, and then we were on our way home.\n\nAll in all, we highly recommend this airline - for us there will never be another.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillmN669HS","crvsd":"jillmN669HS wrote a review Feb 2019","ui_header_link":"jillmN669HS","default":"Edenvale, South Africa","phmbo":"13 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Durban - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r654365360-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"First time flying with Safair","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Checkin was good, boarding was relatively smooth and onboard seating is OK. But somehow there was something that keeps me from feeling that the experience was beyond average. Maybe its because this is the “next” player in the South African domestic market (though SafAir as a company has much more pedigree than the previous low cost airlines that have come and gone). Or maybe its the fact that this was an older aircraft, a B737-4/5, in a market where its major competitors are mostly flying newer A320 or B737-8. Either way, I flew it as it was the return leg on a SAA ticket (with Mango flying the first sector), and I would likely not go and buy a specific FlySafair ticket again, unless it was deeply discounted.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/64/a9/34/caption.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubergine_man","crvsd":"aubergine_man wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"aubergine_man","default":"Geneva, Switzerland","phmbo":"496 contributions","phmbo1":"7262 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Durban - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r642850961-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Decent airline, my first time, OK experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

You can hear this person doesn’t want to be @ work.\n\nFirstly I paid huge amount and now service I get is a shocker, when I tell her I can’t hear you can you speak louder, her answer was “ oh well you are calling a call center” their discussions with other staff I could hear which I have no interest in . Wait that’s not it.......\n\nWaiting for her while she’s trying to increase her sounds, I tell her that please check our flights she says she needs to verify me on her system. So answer her question. I give her our dates. She tells me that I don’t have any flight booked. I almost fell off my desk.\nI almost lost my head starting to think what happened did I now paid these third parties & they never booked. While I am talking to her my wife’s giving me dates and mentioned that we did book with FlySafair. So I give this lady my Departure dates, she says again NO.....\n\nThe hammer was, that I checked all my emails, personal and work. I might have moved that specific email confirmation somewhere....service was horrible the way she’s answering us, constant fear that our money is gone - simply horrible.\n\nI even logged in to my internet banking to check when I paid for this, I was on my way to bank to find out who charged my credit card & what company so I can figure out this mystery. I was in two minds now if we really booked FlySafair or someone else , because Ms Lesedi was confident that we don’t have booking.\nI almost paid British Airways for new tickets, thinking about not being able to see my grandma for her 80 B Day. British airways would have been better choice perhaps. I didn’t pay decided to go to bank.\n\nWhen I was going through my banking statements etc, Not realizing that I am perhaps panicking about nothing, so I called again and someone professional Anwer’s the phone no background noises, after verifying my self she’s telling me how can I assist you with your reservation!!!!! I was shocked that I now have reservation for flights. I managed to speak with Assistant Managers about this & all they did is apologize:(. And yet she agreed that her staff was not professional, and they made her listen to the call.\n\nI wanted to thank the pope. pay otherwise I will want to forget this flight!!!\nregrettably I had booked a return ticket.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimKumarRavi","crvsd":"Ravi K wrote a review Oct 2018","ui_header_link":"Ravi K","default":"Cape Town, South Africa","phmbo":"23 contributions","phmbo1":"4 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Port Elizabeth","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r626311449-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Terrible service No customer skills","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In the past 30 years my wife and I have flown into East London airport while the plane has been thrown about the sky by the strong winds. Twice the winds have almost pushed the plane into the ground and once at the last second the very experienced pilot had to abort, pull up the landing wheels, send the plane staggering skywards just when we were about to touch the runway. Then due to the wind he had to fly out to sea and circle for half an hour before he could return and bring us down safely. Our grandson (4 years) was travelling with us and thought that this was an amazing roller coaster ride, while the rest of us including the air hostesses needed a change of underwear. Normally when landing, the pilots bring the plane in at a fast angle and then at the last moment correct and slam the plane down onto the runway. So my concern was more that, does she have the experience and nerve to land us safely? Well, she aced the landing in very strong winds, a tribute to her skill and training. The cabin staff were excellent, attentive and helpful. Thank you Fly Safair, we will be back.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenhL4615VR","crvsd":"kenhL4615VR wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"kenhL4615VR","default":"King William's Town, South Africa","phmbo":"52 contributions","phmbo1":"10 helpful votes","dmrsr":"East London - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r617935624-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"The pilot was female and extremely good.","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

For family matters we had to fly  between Pretoria and Cape Town, Safair had the cheapest, last minute one way tickets.During the first flight we saw some sparks come out of the left engine, but the crew reassured us that the Captain says we can safely continue our journey. It was a scary flight with  some really bad turbulence, but we landed safely and upon disembarking we could see a huge puddle of oil already under the engine. Apart from this scary first flight, I used their service for two more flights. On the second flight we had a medical emergency on board and it was my experience that the crew handled it very well.The third flight happened without incident, apart from the friendly crew. The flights are cheap, but when booking online, one has to watch out for extra costs, like unclicking pre-added stuff and also limiting yourself to the 7 kg hand luggage limit. (when you get used to travelling like this, it is really great). They also want to charge you extra for choosing a seat, but by skipping this part, you can still choose your seat when you check in online - for free! No need to print the boarding pass or pay for an sms to send it to your phone, it got sent to my email, which is on my phone, so I just downloaded it and by checking in show them my boarding pass on the phone along with my ID.I do recommend this airline and will use them again","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/af/d5/83/wernerwmuller.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wernerwanderlust","crvsd":"Werner Wanderlust wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"Werner Wanderlust","default":"Cape Town, South Africa","phmbo":"136 contributions","phmbo1":"25 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Lanseria","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r617919069-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Cheap flights for last minute bookings","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On arrival at the airport, I was able to go directly to the boarding gate. The boarding passes a processed as we wait and the luggage policy helps me to be more economical in how I pack, since 7kg of luggage and a handbag are free.\n\nThe airline rightly prides itself on getting its passengers to their destination on time. I have appreciated the predictability of what they offer and how it helped me be organised for my travel.\n\nI will definitely be using it as my preferred local airline.

But for some reason they have adopted a new boarding procedure that is really inconvenient for its passengers. Information boards tell you the flight is boarding when in fact it isn't and won't be for a long time. This means that instead of sitting down somewhere to wait you have to join a queue and stand in line for 20 minutes or more. Then once boarding actually starts, your boarding pass is examined by ground staff but as you move down to the plane you are again held in a queue in the air bridge for up to another 20+ minutes. This is really tough on the elderly and parents travelling with young children. On a hot day it is very uncomfortable for all. It is a ridiculous policy that needs to be reexamined.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/32/d9/85/303gilesr.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/303gilesr","crvsd":"303gilesr wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"303gilesr","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"133 contributions","phmbo1":"37 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r617519505-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"RIDICULOUS BOARDING PROCEDURE","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

And having boarded the first flight of the day i have to admit i was absolutely amazed and never felt so happy with service and a flite as i have with Safair.\n\nBelieve you me i have flown with multiple airlines i also have read so much negative reviews and heard of bad experiences with Safair. However until tried you never know.\nFirst of all having to fly with a medical condition severe bruising to ribs and not feeling 100 percent well physically and the last thing anyone in my condition would have wanted was added issues in service delivery especially at 5h30am.\n\nBut from the get go upon checking in how awful of me with all the pain i was already in, cant really recall the name of the attendant that assisted me in CT International but he was the best, like a godsend at that time of morning and his willingness to assist me and make my check in such a breeze i will never forget him even if i tried. It's consultants like him that makes a passengers morning even through the immense pain I've been gritting i will forever be greatful for his assistance. Also inflight, the cabin crew were simply the best, i also had the best tasting cappuccino ever i swear. Extremely helpful and courteous staff.\n\nSo my advice to anyone is before believing everything you read or are told take a chance and open yourself up to a new experience you will be amazed.\nAlso our flight was right on schedule as well as we arrived 20mins ahead of schedule. Now that for me was the cherry on top.\n\nTo Flysafair crew and ground team thank you so much for the best experience even though physically i was challenged medically.\n\nBest flight experience for 2018.....\nPS: even with the congested seating the experience and service delivery far outweighs and makes up for the lack.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singhraksha36","crvsd":"singhraksha36 wrote a review Sep 2018","ui_header_link":"singhraksha36","default":"Durban, South Africa","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Durban","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r615818055-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Best Exp for 2018","tehyy":"Date of travel: September 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The priority boarding was a sales gimmick because it seemed to only be priority boarding onto the bus that took us to our plane, from there on we were swamped by everyone else and ended up boarding after half the plane was filled already.\n\nThe aircraft itself was not exactly a hotel in the sky but that is not necessary for a 2 hour flight. The chairs were comfortable enough albeit rather small, And We didn’t have much leg space in front. They did offer us snacks and drinks but to our own extra cost.\nThe flight was smooth and the captain kept us well informed of turbulence and overhead sites, and within 2 very quick hours we had landed.\n\nI would love to say Safair was good value for money, however I cannot because I firmly believe ALL South African domestic flights are way overpriced.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/71/62/91/avatar.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenfielding","crvsd":"darrenfielding wrote a review Aug 2018","ui_header_link":"darrenfielding","default":"Hangzhou, China","phmbo":"161 contributions","phmbo1":"49 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Port Elizabeth","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r611766351-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Straightforward, simple flying.","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Seats were comfortable but pressure build up was terrible compared to other airlines. The worse of all that I realized it’s not always advisable to rush for cheap flights as there are hidden clauses and the advertisements are not always interpreted the way we see it. Due to family Emergency I could not get my flights canceled or converted to a voucher for later use. I was told that vouchers are only given when cancellation is done 45 days prior. Other available option was to pay R300 per flight to make changes even if it was just a change from my name to my wife with same surname. This was a ridiculous option especially with purchasing flights for the same price.\nOn flight, I came across the magazine which stated that a cancellation upgrade could be done with R200 where a voucher can be chosen.

This alone is reason enough to fly with them. Online check in is a breeze - you can download your boarding pass to your mobile phone, saving paper and time at the airport. The mobile boarding pass is easy to use and scans easily. The seats on the aircraft are quite small, but I'm small so it's not too uncomfortable for me. The legroom is adequate considering the price you pay. One thing I don't really like is that you pay extra to book your seat, even just a regular seat with no extra legroom. This can make the initial price of the ticket quickly add up. I would definitely recommend travelling with hand luggage only - this is free, so your ticket price is lower than if you check luggage in. The staff are friendly and the food for purchase on board, while not exactly cheap, is not grossly overpriced.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F9694BPshannond","crvsd":"Shannon d wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"Shannon d","default":"","phmbo":"7 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - George","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r581895817-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Don't be delayed, fly FlySafair!","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In the beginning their website is not to user friendly and it takes a few times to get use to their logic of thinking in order to make a booking.  I am use to book myself in at the self-checking in machines but for some reason fly Safair is not registered on the machines.  The people at their counters is friendly and very supportive.  Not one of my flights departed “ON Time” but very impressively we landed every time “On Time”. All drinks and snacks during the flight can only be paid by card, “no cash” which I find a bit irritated  as there is NO quick deal for payment.

In such quick turns, one usually expects to find rubbish in the cabin etc. but everything was clean and ready to go when we boarded.\n\nOnce aboard, cabin crew were fresh-faced and handled a range of challenges well - including infants and a guy who couldn't fit his stuff in the overhead bin. We departed quickly and had a lovely flight over to CPT, arriving over 15 minutes early. It would have been nice to hear a PA from the flight crew before reaching cruise altitude (the first we heard from them), but there probably wasn't time given the PE terminal's proximity to the runway.\n\nWhile Safair's fleet is showing their age (our aircraft was at least 25 years old - with doubler strips visible at various points on the fuselage, and lots of loose rubber flying about in spaces in the wing controls), they provided a timely, efficient, and safe operation for a reasonable price.

Since I had something fragile in my bag and it was well under the restricted weight (I had it weighed at the check-in counter), I refused, which upset the hostess.\n\nWhen we got to our seat, the window seat we were given, 11A, had no window! My daughter was heavily upset and threw a tantrum, which upset me, as I specifically asked for a window seat! For a 6 year old, looking forward to a flight, which was a new experience for her, not having a window seat was a big deal.\n\nThe seats are tiny and uncomfortable, which is still okay, considering it is a low cost airline. I could live with that.\n\nAfter eventually managing to distract my daughter, by telling her I would buy her a sandwich and juice, it was even more annoying when I was told that the sandwiches are out of stock! How do these people plan their catering?\n\nWhen we disembarked, my daughter asked the hostess if she could see the cockpit, but was told no, the flight crew is busy. The hostess did not even offer to check with the captain, she did not give a hoot about making a little child happy - she just said no.\n\nI will never ever, under any circumstances, use FlySafair again! Their lack of service is not worth my hard earned money! I fly often for work, but I will not support this airline again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooTaz","crvsd":"BooTaz wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"BooTaz","default":"Port Elizabeth, South Africa","phmbo":"63 contributions","phmbo1":"25 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Port Elizabeth - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r545301357-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Never again!

Ours was packed to capacity! We stood in the bus for 15 minutes, sweat dripping, before going to the plane.

Upon arriving at ORTambo on an international flight and being several hours early we asked to change our tickets to an earlier flight to Cape Town. This they were willing to do at a cost of more than the original ticket price. hence the flight left with open seats and dissatisfied passengers. Our 11.15 flight was then postponed for over two hours and once the gate number had changed three times and we were finally ready to board we had to deal with the most unfriendly ground crew who preferred to argue with already unhappy passengers. There were nearly 10 ground crew and not one was paying any attention to the passengers. We were then loaded on buses and waited for another twenty minutes, breathing in exhaust fumes before we were dispatched to a Star alliance aircraft who had stepped in to \"save the day\".","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/9e/d6/1f/gary-s.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryS4763","crvsd":"Gary S wrote a review Mar 2017","ui_header_link":"Gary S","default":"","phmbo":"27 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r465474346-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Disapointing in so many ways","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This is a low cost airline and as such their is no free in flight service as well as no in flight entertainment, which in the age of tablets is easily forgivable.\n\nThe seats are not designed for long haul flights and table trays are just poor. Legroom is surprisingly big and beats long haul Emirates or Delta easily.\n\nService was as always professional and not in any way different from SAA. Personally I try to avoid the failing yet highly subsidized national carrier and rather support small start ups like Safair or Comair.\n\nThe planes are of the older generation and I believe one machine was an old Al Italia airbus :), which is something to be aware off that probably most machines are \"refurbished\" older planes.\n\nI recommend anyone flying nationally to give them a try and see for yourself if it is not possible to say goodbye to SAA and BA.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/99/avatar.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agter_Paarl","crvsd":"Agter_Paarl wrote a review Jan 2017","ui_header_link":"Agter_Paarl","default":"Cape Town Central, South Africa","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Port Elizabeth","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d10661141-r448766647-FlySafair-World.html","qwuub":"Preferred local carrier, by far","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

If there was one negative, it was that the check in only opened 2 hours before the flight and we had arrived a bit early at the airport and had planned to sit in the Business Lounge for the wait. We had a bag to book in otherwise the on line boarding pass would have allowed us to enter the departures area a bit earlier.
