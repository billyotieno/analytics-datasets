I went through this hassle because then at least I could arrive in the evening (21.30h) and have a normal night rest. I paid around 300 euro extra for that purpose.\nWhen I arrived in Lusaka, they informed me that my flight to Kigali was cancelled. I ended up travelling via Addis, to arrive 00.45h in Kigali, arriving around 02.00 at my guesthouse.\nI am very dissappointed that I wasn't informed in time, so I could have been flying Blantyre, Addis, Kigali. I complained at the customer service. They apologised and were friendly, and gave me an email address to claim back my extra costs. Let's see if that is going to work.\nCurrently i am awaiting a Rwandair flight from Kigali to Kamembe (west Rwanda), supposed to be flying at 07.00h. Because of problems with their aircrafts we have to wait for an aircraft to arrive from Kenya (supposed to arrive at 5.45am, but scheduled to arrive at 09.09am). I was planning to facilitate a workshop today. This is going to start late.\nThey told me this is a temporary problem, and should be sorted once their aircrafts are repaired. What about hiring another aircraft in the meantime?\nI had a positive experience with Rwandair in the past, so let's hope they get back on their feet.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ditteked","crvsd":"Ditteke d wrote a review Nov 2022","ui_header_link":"Ditteke d","default":"Blantyre, Malawi","phmbo":"5 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Blantyre - Kigali","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r869419973-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Poor communication","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I canceled a reservation within 24 hours of payment. To my horror, I discovered the customer call centre they have is in Kigali. This number was not in use! I managed to get email addresses to contact from their office at CPT airport and their official twitter account. However, the responses to my email requests for a refund were lethargic and not transparent. It has now been 3 days and all I know is that the tickets I bought were non refundable. and that only airport taxes are refundable. I was not given information as to how to start this process. My booking references are non existent and I am stuck in limbo not knowing the options available to me at this time. You will note that their ticket price does not include a breakdown of these costs and this complicates matters. So their twitter page advised me to wait for the breakdown. I have also been informed that I will be penalised for rescheduling. If you want value for your money, use other airlines. A friend of mine got her money back after canceling Airlink flight 48 hours after booking minus all these hassles I have been through. Besides that, their flights have been delayed on some trips i have taken with them and their engine is noisy especially if u sit at the back.\nIn summary, Rwandair is not value for money and Airlink is cheaper and hassle free for those doing the CPT-HRE route.\n\"","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanieM64","crvsd":"Danie M wrote a review Nov 2022","ui_header_link":"Danie M","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Cape Town Central - Harare","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r868655048-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Terrible customer care","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Few days before departure I contacted the airline’s office in Lusaka as the flight appeared not to be to sold anymore and hardly could be full. They answered back within 1 hour and gave detailed confirmed, entire itinerary (incl. coming flights). Check-in counters opened pleasantly early, 3½  hour prior departure, so no queues or waiting time. The man at counter advised on seating and showed me configuration and options on his computer. We selected the best options, though I was later further upgraded onboard to have the most spacious seat in economy. Security, health documentation, immigration took less than 10 Minutes. Their partnership with Qatar rendered me access to Pearl lounge in the terminal. There was some discussion whether I was qualified, but in 5 Minutes after some photocopying, they let me in. The lounge is 3rd party, and acceptable with Wi-fi, hot foods, wines and cold beers. Onboard, my preordered special meal though I had to remind them, and it took some time to avail it. Drinks and customer care onboard was very pleasant, nothing was too much, but it took a lot of time as the FAs discussed and recommended drinks to almost every passenger. IFE was only a flight monitor, but the music channels offered a lot. Had to use own headphones. No WiFi, old aircraft, but well maintained. Good announcements from pilots. Noisy aircraft, this B737-800. Flight on time, we arrived 15 Minutes earlier than scheduled. Luggage arrived before I even passed immigration. DreamMiles to their FFP was given me after just 1 day after landing.

Partnership with Qatar Airways is incomplete and unclear: e.g. issued tickets are only partly compatible and manageable on both airlines. Granted lounge access in Doha after a short discussion and some photocopying. Both flights on time. Very noisy aircrafts, very limited IFE. Food very good, as always.

So that airline, ASKY said I would have to go back to the SA embassy to rectify the problem - that was how I missed that flight, then yesterday, I went and got the visa corrected at VFS and also got an email from the SA embassy validating the visa in case anyone asked questions. I got to the airport, but the next ASKY flight to SA would be on Thursday, so the organizers of the program I'm going for, booked a one way flight on Rwand Air so I could fly yesterday. The lady looking through my papers noted the changes on the visa and I showed her the email. She took it to her boss and came back and nothing more was said about the visa. Instead, they looked at my flight itinerary and said my return ticket had no ticket number - the return ticket is with SAA. I got the organizers to send the ticket number but the lady at the desk said her boss said I must get a return ticket with Rwand Air and she said I should wait to appeal to the boss. I kept waiting and he didn't come. That was when I finally lost it and sat on the floor and raked for them but no one answered me. Until I took a video of them, saying what they had done to me. Then the managers and officials of the airline and FAAN came and the issue now became about me making a video and that was basically what I was punished for. I was taken to their crime unit and they got even more upset that I tweeted about what was happening to me. So I was detained for long then taken the police station and accused me of unruly behaviour and of bringing 'doctored' visa and the airline manager now appeared and said he was trying to explain to me that the issue was with the visa and that I could be sent back by SA immigration and if that happened, then I would have to buy a ticket with them and claimed that I refused to listen to anyone. These were all lies. No one told me anything about my visa still being the issue - they just said I had to buy a new ticket. I wasn't allowed to say my side of the story. It was only Rwand Air, the police and airport officials talking and accusing me of all sorts of things and making me, the victim, into the villain. Then they forced me to write an apology letter at the police station after threats of jail or a fine of 250,000. They made me take down the video and tweets and make another video debunking the firs video. Then they let me go. The Rwand Air manager was 'magnanimous' enough to say that they could let me fly the next day, but I must sign an undertaking that if I am sent back by SA immigration, I must pay for my return ticket.

A huge company providing services to many people should at least show some concern for customers and communicate any inconveniences. We were made to fill forms by some agents at the airport who didn't seem have much knowledge on what we should expect because there was noone from the airline to help. Can we at least know how  we can be sure that we receive our bag on Wednesday and what time. Because the service seems unreliable. How can we know where our bag is and if it's safe.

This is not how a decent airline is expected to treat its customers . We got booked on a new flight two times, meaning two times, we got back to the airport to find out completely at the end, before boarding, that we could not board the other aircraft as the flight was fully booked. I never experienced this ever before in my life (and have been going thorugh quite some candellatuobs so far).\n\nMoreover, I tried claiming a refund but customer service is almost unreachable and tries to avoid responding my questions. They say it is not possible to claim a refund etc. nor refund costs incurred for excess luggage at another airline (where they rebooked us on), but when I ask where I can see proof of this statement, all goes silent and I don't get answers anymore. Hence I highy doubt their fairness in way of approaching refunds/claims etc.\n\nJust a message: please, be aware when you are flying this company and better don't do so, in order not to experience the same hassle as I unfortunately encountered. I learned a valuable lesson not to fly ever again with a company of cheaters like this one, at least...","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123dirkdr","crvsd":"DirkDR wrote a review Jun 2022","ui_header_link":"DirkDR","default":"Republic of North Macedonia","phmbo":"3 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Kigali - Brussels","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r843550499-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Most horribly customer service I have ever encountered","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The layover in Kigali was supposed to be approximately 2 hours. The night before the early morning flight out of Dubai an email notice was sent that an additional 5 hours of layover was expected. By that time changing flights or getting an alternative flight was not an option. The flight itself was not too bad, except it appears the control of customer baggage was not well controlled as several passengers were requested to hand over their carry on luggage to be placed with the checked in baggage just before the flight.\nKigali airport itself is small,but all the amenities are available, except for customer service. You need to hunt for a customer service representative if you need one.\nThe new departure time was 11:00am. Myself and my travel companion waited in the airport lounge until 10:45 (there was no announcement for boarding) before seeking out what was happening. The airport representative at that point only informed me that the flight was delayed by an additional hour. There was no PA announcement and no explanation except for\"operational reasons\".\nAt around 12:00 we boarded the bus to the aircraft, where the baggage was still being loaded.\nThe flight only left at 12:20.\nAt this point I should point out another point of frustration which was only uncovered at Kigali airport.\nEventually when the announcement was made to board, I discovered that the flight was not going directly to Cape Town but instead stopping at Harare, Zimbabwe to drop off and then pickup passengers. At no point in the booking process was this apparent. Really frustrating, and deceptive in my opinion.\nI really would like to see this airline succeed, but with the current level of service I fail to see that happening as it would take an extreme set of circumstances to book with Rwandair again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayk944","crvsd":"ay k wrote a review May 2022","ui_header_link":"ay k","default":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Dubai - Cape Town Central","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r837312757-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"The art of failed communication","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2022","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Cancelled our flight with no notice, charged us to new tickets, held us up for 3 hours to get the new tickets, lost an entire day of vacation at the airport going and then repeated the same procedure returning to Nairobi and lost another day.  Gloria, the ticket agent in Rwanda lied to us so many times i lost count.  Said we had to buy new tickets again to get back to Nairobi, but only had 3 seats for the 5 of us, then miraculously a 4th seat opened up but she couldn’t downgrade from business class to economy class.  We asked to move one of the 5 of our travelers to a later flight cause there were no seats left.  This issue caused antlers hour delay while she tried to gain approval from somewhere to make the move.  Then told us we had to get Nairobi to make all the changes  since the tickets originated from there (really?).  I suggested she fly us to Nairobi and we’d handle it when we got there, LOL.  All in all it cost us two extra days of vacation and an additional $2300 just with RwandAir and I haven’t even gotten into the airport fiasco requiring 3 covid tests in 3 days, visas to enter back into Kenya that were NOT required by Kenya.

As it was raining, we were glad to be able to wait in the comfortable armchairs inside the bus before reaching a real J cabin/seat on propeller aircraft.\n\nIn flight, outbound there was no service at all not sure if its covid related or not, because inbound (Kamembe - Kigali) a diffrent crew served us a pre-departure glass of champagne and we even got a refill once in the air while cruising for 10 min.\n\nWhile the business lounge at Kamembe surprisingly exists, this is nothing to write home about.\n\nTo sum up, we did not expect any kind of service especially during covid + very short flight, however the return leg made us thinking why a big change with their protocol of service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore311019","crvsd":"Habitant du monde wrote a review Mar 2021","ui_header_link":"Habitant du monde","default":"","phmbo":"9 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Kigali - Cyangugu","dmrsr2":"Domestic","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r785602738-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"RwandAir and its inconsistent service","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2021","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Convenient flying times (mid-day out, and afternoon home). Both flights were on the same aircraft, a De Havilland DHC-8, called “Dash 8”. This is a propeller, which is small (80 seats?) and noisy. Not many passengers on the outbound, but full on homebound. Cheap, promotional ticket (250 USD) with generous luggage allowance. Both flights on time. Free seat selection at check-in. Special seafood meal accommodated both ways and extra food provided on request. Check-in smooth and Cabin crew polite and efficient. A short stop in Kilimajaro airport on the way back went smooth.

Just before we boarded, 3 gentlemen with a weighing scale brought a weighing machine and asked us (people who had dury free bags) to weigh our bags. They weighed and was found to have more than the 3 kgs allowed, I was made to pay for the extra weight. Something which didn't make me happy. They should have warmed me before I booked the airline that they dont allow past the 3 kgs for hand luggage.\n\nI was super annoyed I have them the money and told them to keep the change. Very very disappointed. Am a frequent flier and all the airlines have used never weigh duty free bags. This is totally bad.\n\nMy connecting flight to Kenya was more than worse, they make us board a bombardier, which was smelling poop every 10 minute interval. The smell was so bad that after we landed I threw up and my stomach was bloated because of the bad smell from the toilet. I have never flew on a bombardier before, but I think when you value your customer, you have to make them feel valued. I didn't feel the value of my money at all and I will never tell my friends to try and book this airline. It will be my first and last time booking this airline.\n\nThe staff in general were smiling, which is a good thing, they were helpful. Which I appreciate a lot. But the ladies need more training if rwanda air wants to put itself on the map of aviation industry in africa. They were pathetic, especially their hair. Rwanda has beautiful women, but presentation matters alot. So please do something about presenting these beautiful african hostesses.

I put my trust in RwandAir to get me in on time, and they did not disappoint. After having flown in their Bombardier planes on my previous visits, I was pleasantly surprised to fly onboard their Boeing 737-700 series flight WB 465 Kigali bound via Entebbe at 5.00am. As we commenced our descend into Entebbe we hit serous turbulence, the plane bobbed and bounced and sent fear among passengers, but the calm voice of the Captain calmed everyone down and we were soon out if it, touching down at Entebbe at 6.00am. Plenty to keep busy onboard the IKAZE Boutique duty free Magazine with great gift items and also the INZONZI in flight magazines with a great of stories in them. Incidentally I was standing right outside the toilet when the turbulence started and was very impressed by the professionalism of the cabin crew one of them reminding me with a broad smile to be cautious and to hold on to something inside there. All in all it was a pleasant flight with great on board service by the entire Team. My flight back into Nairobi was on the Bombardier pleasant flight departing on time and arriving on schedule. I was able to buy some great gift items on board among them the M5 micro cellphone a great back up phone so tiny that it fits in my wallet.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/challengecentreken2","crvsd":"Ali Mazoa wrote a review Feb 2020","ui_header_link":"Ali Mazoa","default":"Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"32 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Kigali","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r748429888-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Classic!","tehyy":"Date of travel: February 2020","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The check in process was lengthy and chaotic with passengers checking in multiple pieces of luggage which were mostly wrapped up crates. It looked more like a freight carrier than a commercial airline. The flight itself was fairly comfortable. Upon arrival in Harare we stood for a good 40 mins before questioning why our baggage was taking so long. That's when we were told that the plane had proceeded to Cape Town by the local luggage handlers and that there was no luggage. We were advised to file a report but there was no indication of when that luggage would arrive. There was no Rwandair rep on site and an email sent to their email address was returned as undeliverable. So all 10 passengers had to proceed without their luggage and no information. I live 400km away from Harare and had to be in at work the following day minus my luggage. Not to mention the distress of not knowing when it would arrive and the cost of travelling 400km back. Greatly disappointed. Would strongly recommend not to use them. Spoilt the end of my holiday.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey728967","crvsd":"Odyssey728967 wrote a review Dec 2019","ui_header_link":"Odyssey728967","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Dubai - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r730225452-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Priced too good to maintain quality of service!

Upon arrival at Abuja airport, i was waiting for my luggage at the luggage point and i discovered that my luggage wasn't there. I approached 1 of the staffs working there and informed him i cannot seem to find my luggage, which he then told me that 3 passangers luggage were left over in Kigali and mine was 1 of them. That alone spoiled all my plans, i never expected them to leave behind any luggage since they had enough time from my arrival to kigali to when we departed from kigali(over 4 hours). My Vacation is for a week in Nigeria and i was told my luggage will arrive with the next flight after 2 days. I don't live in Abuja, i will have to travel to Abuja to get my luggage and then travel back. All my plans for this vacation has been ruined because of this, i cannot see how Rwanda Air can make up for this. After my return to Dubai with them in a few days, i don't see my self flying Rwanda Air anymore. I hope i get my luggage on Wednesday.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulganiyub","crvsd":"Abdulganiyu B wrote a review Nov 2019","ui_header_link":"Abdulganiyu B","default":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dubai - Abuja","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r725762376-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Lost Luggage","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff are really exceptional and honesty the best airline food I've had for a long time. The in flight entertainment is limited, a few films and the odd episode of TV programmes, however, it's sufficient. If this airline flew through any airport other than Kigali it would easily be 5 star, however, it is let down by the airport transfer at Kigali.\nThe security are rude and slow, not only do they xray your bag they rifle through almost every bag to see if there is anything worth taking. Even though internationally you can carry a lighter or a box of matches at Kigali they are contraband, both in hand luggaga and checked in, and they will destroy your back to get to them, even Dubai security is better than this. Once you get passed this nonsense you are ussured into the gates, a big room, no food, no drink unless you go out of security so they can make you look like a criminal again on the way back. NOT an international airport but a regional airport with its own set of rules and people who just want to feel important.

I travelled from Dubai to Nigeria via Kigali on the 31st of August with my family. The first surprise was the way the ground staff shoved my 5 year old daughter back in to the bus at the point of boarding. As if that was not bad enough, getting on board i discovered that there are no personalized in flight entertainment on board a 5hr plus flight. For the first 1hr of boarding, the air conditioning was turned off. This was not rectified until the plane took off and reached its cruising altitude. At this point everyone had to devise all sort of things as hand fan. All the while, the cabin crew where just non chalant. The treatment meted out to passengers by the Rwandan police at the point of connection is another piece for another day. The final straw was when i arrived in Lagos, Nigeria after over 12hrs only to discover that ALL my checked in luggages (4) were left in Dubai. The flimsy excuse was that the airline had to leave some luggages behind because of total weight of the aircraft.\nWhereas in actual fact, Rwandair gives priority to luggages sent as cargo over luggages belonging to passengers who actually pay for these services.\n1. Luggage allowance for 3 passengers is 46kg ×3 = 138kg\n2. Total weight of my luggages was 85.3kg hence no excuse for leaving ALL my luggages in Dubai.\n\nIn conclusion, please RUN!!!!!!! From this airline as it is the Headquarters of fraudulent practices. I wish i had been warned.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonolal","crvsd":"Sonola L wrote a review Sep 2019","ui_header_link":"Sonola L","default":"Abeokuta, Nigeria","phmbo":"10 contributions","phmbo1":"6 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dubai - Lagos","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r705216345-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Africa's Nightmare!!!!!!","tehyy":"","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I received several emails from both Lastminute.com and RwandAir with flight changes and still on the day that we travelled we was unsure of our flight schedule. To be honest all of the above signs were red flags and should I have known better, I would have cancelled my flights, and should have asked for my money back.\n\nRwandair are more concerned about people's money more than service and are legit fraudsters but I tell you one thing RwandAir will soon be declared bankrupt.\n\nOur flights were delayed from Gatwick Airport and we was only informed of this once we had checked in our last piece of luggage at around 16.30pm. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 19.10pm on Saturday the 27th July but was told it was delayed until 22.45pm. We was given a voucher of £10 to compensate the delay lol. Around 21.00pm the boarding gate information screens constantly changed. At around 22.00p. We rushed to the boarding gate as we was told it was time to board but once we got to the gate there was zero communicstion and we was not informed of anything until almost midnight in which we was told that our aeroplane was still in Brussels. The aeroplane finally arrived to Gatwick in which we boarded after 2am and then left Gatwick around 3am. We then had to return to Brussels to collect more passengers after this we made our way to Rwanda. I forgot to mention that the aeroplane was filthy and disgusting, the toilets had no tissue this made my 12 year old nephew throw up as he was sitting on a dirty chair and the floors were filthy! Also the blankets smelt awful! Anyways as soon as we reached Rwanda again we was strung along multiple times, staff taking us around in circles with no answers. The airport staff had no clue what was going on after passengers started to show their frustrations, eventually we was informed that there were more delays and because we refused to wait in the airport it was then we was told we would be taken to a hotel. The staff at Rwanda Aiport had given us directions to go outside and find the coach but again no one was there. We constantly had to find staff for directions and confirmation but the staff were completely clueless.\n\nWe was made to wait on the coach for over 40 minutes before we was driven to the hotel to freshen up without no suitcases. :/ The the staff had no knowledge and the security were extremely rude with how they handled us. At the hotel, I was told I would be next door to my sister only to be put in the basement with no hot water or internet. I then had to make my way back to reception to ask where my sister was only to find out she was on the second floor. I asked them why we was not put toegther only to be told more excuses. Anyways our coach arrived to pick us up at 21.00pm. We reached the airport and had to wait a further three hours as our flight scheduled for 00.40am. We reached Tanzania on the 29th July after 5am!\n\nMy ticket was changed multiple times before my departure. Both Rwanda and lastminute.com were confused, lacked basic knowledge and information completely dismissed me and my concerns. I had travelled with my 5 year old son, 12 year old nephew along with my 60 year old mother and big sister.\n\nThe behaviour from the airline has been totally unacceptable, unprofessional and ruined our experience! Our children were upset, hungry, distressed and suffered extreme fatigue not only that but our holiday has been shortened and we missed a very important occasion that we can't get back!\n\nWe missed my cousins wedding! Thanks to RwandAir! I will never ever travel with your airline again and nor will I recommend your airline. RwandAir is on its way to being bankrupt! What a bloody joke!\n\nAlmost two weeks later and still waiting to be contacted with regards to a refund that I've constantly had to chase up.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT TRAVEL WITH RWANDAIR!

First of all, we were delayed in Guangzhou for over an hour, because “the plane arrived late”. And people joked that it was “African time”. The customer service was very rude. I am very observant and I could see how the flight attendants served the people. One lady in particular was very rude and never even out on a smile, and if you asked for something she would say rudely “it’s finished!”. There was only one lady I noticed. She was pretty amazing in attending to the passengers, very professional. The rest were all so unprofessional, looked like they just didn’t get any training. This didn’t just happen to me, but I was observing their behaviour the whole time. On arrival to Kigali I had to wait for about ten hours for my next flight to Nairobi. Now this is where things got interesting. Everyone else who had to wait for a long time was checked in to a hotel, and one guy told me to go and ask if I could be checked in too since I had to wait for about nine hours, and they said they wouldn’t check me in because I am from Kenya and there were many Kenyan flights each day? Wha kind of logic is that? Does that even make sense? Anyways I was the only one who had to wait all day in the lounge for my next flight while the rest were checked into the hotel. And since I have asthma, st some point I needed fresh air so I wanted to walk out, but the guard at the door stopped me, a certain woman, very sarcastic. She said she didn’t care, even if I had asthma attack and died, she said she didn’t care. This really shocked me and the other servers guard, a man, came and apologetically told me I couldn’t go but if I had difficulty breathing there was a first aid kit, I thought that was very professional of him and wondered why that other security guard was so mean and rude. I was literally in shock. I hope they will remember this. Worst nightmare of all time. My first time using it and won't ever do it again. I’ve spoken to people who’ve reported the same experiences especially with the ride customer service. All the other airlines are doing very well with customer service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carenskar","crvsd":"Caren Rutto wrote a review Jul 2019","ui_header_link":"Caren Rutto","default":"Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Guangzhou - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r694338130-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"I will NEVER book this flight again, I’d rather walk or go by ship!","tehyy":"Date of travel: July 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We flew in the Boeing 737-800.\n\nThe planes have been refurbished to an as new feel. Could be new??? In-cabin service, food service, drinks service have gone up a few notches. Duty free service is now available. For us, the client service in general is now exceptional and customer responsive. My husband has glaucoma. Though he can walk, he requires assistance especially in those very long airport corridors.\n\nOn a previous trip we travelled with a Nigerian sportsperson whom everyone seemed to be greeting. I never realized how serious his condition was until a stretcher fetched him from the airport cabin, and an emergency team was ready for him just outside immigration.\n\nI have been flying Rwandair from Accra to Johannesburg over five years now....always business class. I can charge my phone and iPad from my seat, watch movies from my individual screen, listen to the latest internal music, or enjoy their top quality cabin magazine is top quality.\n\nThe food and drinks menu reminds me of British Airways in quality, healthiness, and presentation. The drinks service is impeccable save for lack of honey and rooibos tea. South African rooibos is the in health tea. Black, white or green Rwanda tea would have been a lovely novelty.\n\nThis airline is price competitive and gives a 50% saving over flying direct from Accra to Johannesburg. There is a stopover in Lagos or Abuja, and a brief change of aircrafts in Kigali.\n\nThe Kigali Lounge is of international stands and beats Orly in Paris in bathroom quality.\n\nOh Boy, immigration is fussy even with transit passengers.\n\nWe have encountered business travellers and diplomats not flying their national career. Could be the routes, the service, or cost factor.\n\nDoor to door the trip is 10 hours. The downside or upside is the flight arrives at about 2am in Johannesburg. Check in is 11.30 returning.\n\nThe plus is Business Class passengers now have a 3 bag allowance each at 20kg. A fourth might be added if one has points. This comes in handy should an artifact or two catch your fancy, carry or bring back too many gift items, or enjoy shopping when travelling.\n\n\nNothing so far has motivated us to change. not even the fact that we always miss duty-free shopping.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/64/c7/cf/only1thebest.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/only1thebest","crvsd":"only1thebest wrote a review Jul 2019","ui_header_link":"only1thebest","default":"Greater Accra, Ghana","phmbo":"68 contributions","phmbo1":"8 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Accra - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r688203917-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Better Service At Half The Price","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

While returning we had a horrible experience as the luggage of majority of passengers didn't arrive in Mumbai. We had a connecting flight to Kolkata so passengers were in a chaotic condition as most of our necessary stuff were in those bags. After lot of running here and there we submitted the forms to the authorities . The airlines told they would send the bags to our homes.Many passengers were bound for other places so without clothes and other essential items it was difficult so we had to purchase a lot of stuff to continue our daily routine.then we constantly mailed airlines and called them and after about 15days or so our bags were delivered to our homes intact. After repeated mails the company paid 80$ i.e 5600 rupees for four of us. The inconveniences we faced were faced likewise by many passengers. So think twice before choosing that flight.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/37/85/b7/sumanam34.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumanaM34","crvsd":"Sumana M wrote a review Jul 2019","ui_header_link":"Sumana M","default":"","phmbo":"41 contributions","phmbo1":"48 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kilimanjaro National Park - Mumbai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r688169648-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Regarding Rwand air","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

After RW assured us that they have fixed our tickets, they again made changes to our returning flight from Kigali to Addis without informing us. We purchased a direct flight from Kigali to Addis departing at 16:20 and without informing us prior, they changed the flight to 15:15 (one hour earlier) with a stop in Bujumbura. When we arrived at the Kigali airport, Rwanda airline representatives were not transparent with us  about the stop in Bujumbura and the change of the flight times. When we wanted to receive some answers about the flight time changes and the sudden stop in Bujumbura, the airport staff became rude and tried blaming us for this situation (this discussion took place at 15:09 - and they seriously wanted us to proceed through security and immigration) when the departure time was 15:15. When I asked them if the aircraft is still there and if it will wait for us, they did not give me an answer. Hence we were not able to board the flight because of their failure to inform us about the flight cancellation and rescheduling - incredibly enough they did not want to take responsibility and in all seriousness told us that we had to purchase a new ticket for $900 per person!!! After holding us at the airport for 9 hours without eating and drinking, we spoke with airport security who finally decided that the airline was in the wrong and pressured the Rwanda Air staff to put us on a new flight (which was their responsibility all along). Rwanda Air is incredibly incompetent and unprofessional in providing customer support and service and have absolutely no training in how to treat their customers. Throughout our nine horrific hours at the airport, we were harassed by Rwanda Airline staff - and called \"liars who wanted to miss our flight\" by the head of Costumer Relations himself, Vincent  Nyarwaya. They put us into an incredibly bad situation and took no responsibility until they were forced to by airport security! In addition they lost our luggage, which still has not arrived in Addis! Do not take this airline, because you do not want to be stuck in their hands when they make mistakes and are unwilling to correct it. Simply a horrific experience!!!!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/0b/d4/7a/marion-k.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813marionk","crvsd":"Ephrem G wrote a review May 2019","ui_header_link":"Ephrem G","default":"","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Addis Ababa - Mumbai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r674553400-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Nightmare Experience!!!

Direct flight (in contrast to fly opposite direction). This aircraft has no lie flat seats which is a disaster for a night flights. I purchased the ticket in faith of their refurbished A330, but they made an equipment change obviously due to low load. Check-in online is a joke and waste of time: after filling some 7 pages with info online they eventually laconically inform that “check-in must be done in Airport”. Worst: landed in T2 in Dubai, which is a messy LCC terminal and fought my way to T1 for onward flights. Homepage misleading and systematically hide info on booking class. Even their most expensive bis-ticket give only few miles which furthermore only can be used on Rwandair. Lounge in Kigali is fine but they have blindfolded all windows with tape to deprive passengers any view of tarmac which is painful, embarrassing, and a misunderstood security issue. Luggage checked in to next destination only, thus had to fight again in Dubai for further luggage transfers. These 6 issues deprives good rating and we land at average at the highest. On the brighter side is the nice atmosphere onboard, great traditional Rwandan decorated interior in business cabin: FA’s were great and well caring. Champagne and welcome drinks provided. Menu cards and drink lists provided. Sparse supply, e.g. only one kind of beer and only two dishes offered for supper (only 2 options). The food was only passable but plenty. Breakfast of poor quality. Punctual airline with stunning, tall statuated FAs. However, their flight equipment is limited and they are not attached to any airline alliance, thus miles earning is only for their Dream Miles Program, which is very stingy with miles even for full fare business tickets. Will chose Kenya Airways and Ethiopian in future despite detours (over NBO or ADD) as they are considerably cheaper and mostly have a better product.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/0c/0f/6a/385andersp.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385andersp","crvsd":"385andersp wrote a review Mar 2019","ui_header_link":"385andersp","default":"Hue, Vietnam","phmbo":"36 contributions","phmbo1":"44 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r656457175-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Waste of money","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I carried it on my South African Air flight from Victoria Falls to Johannesburg. I carried it on my Rwanda Air flight From Johannesburg to Kigali. I carried it on my Virgin Atlantic flight from Johannesburg to London and London to Los Angeles. The ONLY problem I had was with an incredibly difficult and obstinate supervisor working for Rwanda Air in the Kigali airport. She insisted that this giraffe could be used as a weapon and that I had to check it as luggage. Now my giraffe was wrapped in some padding but no where near enough to be thrown under a plane. They said they would put a fragile sticker on it and it would be fine.\n\nI proceed to get on the plane and can actually see the luggage truck out my window. I can see my giraffe is tucked to the right side of the luggage so I was feeling ok until I watched three suitcases fall on top of it and then the men loading the luggage tug on it multiple times to get it out from under some other bags. This was EXACTLY what I was afraid of and sure enough I unwrapped it when I got home and the entire nose area of my giraffe has broken off and one of the ears is broken off. I will try to glue it back together but it is incredibly disappointing that all the effort I put into keeping this giraffe protected while traveling through the country was all ruined because of one woman working for this airline.\n\nReading other reviews this seems to be a problem flying out of Kigali so for this reason I would not ever fly Rwanda Air out of Kigali ever again. In fact, if there is another option, I would choose to not fly this airline at all.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan1010","crvsd":"megan1010 wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"megan1010","default":"west hollywood","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"3 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r648948569-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Would Not Recommend","tehyy":"Date of travel: January 2019","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My return flight on the other hand was the complete opposite to  say the least. During the check in stage, I was told that I wouldn't be able to take a painting on board as it was \"too big\" - I can assure you that it was not.  Several airlines I've travelled with in the past have allowed me to take larger paintings and pictures on board and I was very surprised by his decision.  He told me that if i nwanted to travel with my painting  then, I'd have to pay $US 180 and check it in as a third luggage as I already had 2 suitcases. Now, to anyone with a sound mind that is a hefty price for a painting which didn't  even weigh a kilo but apparently it was more about the size as oppose to the weight. Imagine my surprise when I boarded the plane to find a painting (the owner confirmed it was a painting) larger than mine tucked behind the last row of seats in Premium Economy with a fragile sticker on it.  The man who checked in my luggage was explicit when he told me that my picture was too large to take on board with me and, yet  i was staring at a painting larger than mine. I couldn't believe my eyes.Once I'd gotten over the painting saga, I  was bemused to see someone sitting in my allocated seat. I told one of the crew member, I was told that my seat had been surrendered to a family of 4 because they wanted to sit together.  Whilst i appreciate that most families  want to sit together it's not fair to simply hand over seats that your \"other valuable\" customers have booked in advance for a variety of reasons.  Fortunately, I was allocated another window seat but there were countless passengers complaining that their seats had been allocated to other people willynilly.  What a complete farcical.Rwandair needs to be consistent with its rules and regulations. Luckily, i was able to return the painting to my hosts and arrange to have it sent to London by DHL.Rwandair needs to please  consider that your customers have a variety of reasons why they may book their seats in advance so, please honour their requests.If I ever fly with Rwandair again, it will be a moment too soon and it will be only be from London to Kigali.   I'll use a different airline for my outbound journey.        A generous 2 stars have been given for my outbound journey from London Gatwick to Kigali.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Beie","crvsd":"Travel_Beie wrote a review Jan 2019","ui_header_link":"Travel_Beie","default":"London, United Kingdom","phmbo":"68 contributions","phmbo1":"73 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Kigali","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r648357041-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Discriminatory airline rules and complete chaos aboard the airline","tehyy":"","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Upon our return to SA, we received the wonderful news that our bags did not arrive. We were told that the bags were Kigali and was expected to be flown to SA in the next few hours. Of course, this was not true. It took the airline almost 40 hours to figure out that the luggage never even left Mumbai. During the waiting period, we struggled to get any answers or assistance from anyone working for the airline. Anyone we spoke to either didn't know what was going on or made it clear that this whole delay in luggage issue was also quite an inconvenience to them.

Bear in mind that I travel economy often with SAA and other carriers but the space limitation imposed by Rwandair is just awful. Furthermore, I ordered specific meal plans ahead of time only to be told that they don't have requested meals for my family and I. The story was the same on the return flight. At least, the plane from Dubai to Kigali was newer and had better leg space and online entertainment. My meal plans were not fulfilled yet again. There was a stop in Mombasa again which we were not informed about. This meant that the flight was delayed this causing me to be late for my next domestic flight. I sometimes recieved food. The quality of the food was appalling. The rolls were especially hard. As in, I struggled to even take a bite. They were so stale. The food lacks flavour, desserts are sickly sweet and off-putting.

The crew were friendly and I generally enjoyed my flight.\n\nMy issues are;\n\n1. When I bought my tickets, one condition was my first flight change was \"free\". When I tried changing my return date, I was charged $70!!!!! Why??? This is misleading! Further to that, the lady from customer care said $50 was a general fee for changing the ticket, while $20 was for the upgrade in Economy to another ticket class because that of my original ticket was unavailable. Shockingly when we boarded, the plane was only about 1/3 full!!!!! So I am almost certain my original ticket class was indeed available but they wanted to upsell.\n\n2. The online facilities for check-in and for managing flight bookings etc does not work. Why? I don't know that either. Spoke to yet another staff member who advised that they don't check in passengers over the phone so we must go online but online check in was not working from their website.\n\n3. An agent at the customer service desk seemed least interested and casually gave me a mobile number supposedly for the Head of Online transactions (or sth like that) to contact him on my own and explain to him. The line does not work.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babiryieM","crvsd":"babiryieM wrote a review Dec 2018","ui_header_link":"babiryieM","default":"","phmbo":"50 contributions","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r640252410-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Good flight but frustrating customer service","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Same with those directing boarding on the ground. Check-in staff were helpful . Also smooth at passport control.\nMeals were fine. Not luxurious and a bit on the saucy side , but fine for a beginner airline.\n\nI seriously suggest checking the number of bags being brought onto the plane in Kigali.

They offered us 2 options: to book us in the next flight...18 hours later; or to manage our booking ourselves and get refunded within a week. I chose the 2nd option, had to pay over 700€ and am now struggling for 3 weeks to get reimbursed.

Aircraft very well maintained looked brand new. Terrible to make transit transfers in DXB, Had to struggle in the middle of the night with busses from T1 to T2 where there is always check in chaos and no signage nor separation of airlines. Had to insist on lounge access as the check-in counters could not care less about passengers. Was granted access to a sub par lounge in T2 called Marhaba. The bar sections was for smokers also so air was hazy. Poor boarding services: at gate on time but then shuttled around by bus for ages after waiting in the bus for 20 Minutes before it took off. Onboard nice atmosphere, great traditional Rwandan decorated interior in business cabin: FA’s were great and well caring. However, no menu cards nor drink list - sparse supply. Food acceptable and plenty. Champagne and other welcome drinks provided. IFE worked well. Seats very nice and spacious, I slept well. Got dinner at night and got a full breakfast from Mombasa to Kigali. Good airline, though not attached to any alliance. Ticket not cheap, otherwise could have rated 4/5.

I specifically looked on their website to see if they had a 7kg weight restriction for a carry on, but there was no mention of weight on the site.  When I got to the counter I was told that my carry-on bag was heavy and I needed to pay $46USD to check an extra bag.  I went to the office to pay and was told the fee was payable by cash only.  I left my bags at the counter so I didn’t have USD in the wallet I took.  I had to pay in Ugandan Shillings and they gave me a TERRIBLE exchange rate.  They told me I had to pay 184,000 UGX which equated to $53USD based on the exchange rate I received when I drew cash from my bank and that included the foreign exchange fee adjustment. According to my calculation the fee should have been 160,000UGX for the $46 extra bag fee.  They used an exchange rate of 4,600 shillings per $1 when the market rate is 3,700 shillings per $1.  I paid 185,000UGX and did not receive the 1,000 Shilling change so yet another way they over charged me.  Another inconvenience was that I had one bag that was 1kg over and one bag that was 2kg under.  They initially told me I had to move the 1kg to the other bag but when they saw my aggravation they told me not to worry about it.  After all of this I get on the plane and the plane is practically empty.  So they gave me all this grief about a few kg’s on a practically empty plane.  It’s complete nonsense in my opinion!The flight crew was very pleasant and the plane was clean and comfortable, but I would never subject myself to dealing with their check-in or business office again!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/3f/e3/03/livingdreamsjoyfully.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivingDreamsJoyfully","crvsd":"Latiesha Johnson wrote a review Aug 2018","ui_header_link":"Latiesha Johnson","default":"Temple, Texas","phmbo":"1108 contributions","phmbo1":"87 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Entebbe - Nairobi","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r610082719-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Terrible Customer Service","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We checked in one bag each - both under 15kg when we each had an allowance of 2 x 23kg bags. When we asked to sit together on the flight the man laughed at us and said there were no seats left together and that if we wanted to sit together, we could go buy ourselves a new plane ticket for another day. Maybe this should've been a sign of what was to come...\n\nAfter our flight, I was left standing at baggage reclaim for a whole hour, before myself and 29 others were notified that our bags had been deliberately left behind at Kigali Airport. As you can imagine, after a night flight and waiting for one hour at baggage reclaim everyone was very upset and angry. At this point there were no Rwandair representatives around for us to talk to, and we were all left to talk to Dnata, who shockingly told us that we need to wait for a phone call to say our bag has arrived, at least 24hours later, and that we will have to pick up our own bag, despite the fault being of the airline not ourselves.\n\nI will add that the flight attendants were friendly, but I am currently left without my luggage, and knowing that I will have to pay large taxi fees to return to the airport to collect my luggage when it eventually arrives. Really appalling service.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaLeigh31","crvsd":"JBR wrote a review Aug 2018","ui_header_link":"JBR","default":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","phmbo":"8 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Kigali - Dubai","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r609871778-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"29 check in bags deliberately left behind, all customers expected to return to the airport 24+ hours later to collect","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Also I had heard good things about them and I wanted to try them myself.\nI took an early morning flight from Entebbe on a Bombardier plane and changed flights at Kigali. I went straight through security (which took a while but seemed efficient and thorough) onto the next flight. It was all very easy.\nI flew midweek and the plane (an Airbus A330) was only half full, meaning I had several seats to myself. They were the comfiest plane seats I've ever sat on (and I was in economy). There was plenty of legroom. The plane seemed to be new and had an excellent entertainment system. I was going back to the UK to visit my family and really felt spoilt during my flight.\nI was very impressed with all the staff. The captain took time to slowly walk down the aisles of the plane and greet each passenger individually. He did this before we took off from Entebbe. He did this again when we got to Kigali. The flight attendants were polite and very helpful. Nothing was too much to ask for.\nThe main flight took 8 hours and 20 minutes. I think managed to cram in 4 films.\nThe Rwandese are serious about developing tourism. The whole RwandAir experience was very professional. I also liked the Rwandese touches, such as the artwork in the cabin, the local butter served with meals, the in-flight magazine (which is very good) and the images of gorillas that appear on the entertainment screens.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/49/94/9b/charliebeau.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieBeau","crvsd":"Charlotte Beauvoisin Diary of a Muzungu wrote a review Aug 2018","ui_header_link":"Charlotte Beauvoisin Diary of a Muzungu","default":"Kampala, Uganda","phmbo":"463 contributions","phmbo1":"123 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Entebbe - London","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r602943529-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"A fantastic experience","tehyy":"Date of travel: May 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

First earlier on this year I travelled to Entebbe, and found my luggage had not only been opened as there was a sticker on my toiletry bag from Rwandair confirming this, but my bag was damaged. They cut my bag to get to open my toiletry bag and I had to send it for repairs at my own cost as they were not keen on repairing my bag. Before that I found my suitcase with a huge cut on the outside which they repaired after 4 weeks and my bag is now so ugly as the repair workmanship was rushed. All this was reported to them via Twitter and I was exhausted with the follow up. The worst was the flight from NBO to HRE WB 110. After the flight was moved from 6:10am to 5:10am, we left for Kigali from NBO WB 465 and arrived at 6:50am after a stop over in Entebbe. This was not indicated when making the booking there was a stop over. The flight connecting to HRE was scheduled for 8:10 however at about 8:30am as usual no communication given we were informed by the notice board the flight had changed. After asking the officials they then said Operational Issue and the flight was to be delayed by 2 hours and at about 8:45 they announced it to to the passengers. Unbeknownst to us, we waited 3 hours for a flight from London to connect through Kigali. We were scheduled to arrive 11:00am and we arrived in HRE at 1:15pm. And after waiting another hour for our luggage we were informed the luggage is in KGL and will be sent the next day by an airport official. No communication from Rwandair on this or apology for the inconvenience to the passengers who will have to spend an extra night in HRE waiting for their luggage.  What is worse is they did not communicate this to us at all during the flight that there is no luggage. I am baffled why I waited 3 hours in KGL only for my luggage to not be put on the same flight to HRE. This is the last time I will use this flight as it seems the airline has bitten off more than they can chew. I have no luggage or communication on when or what time I will receive my bags tomorrow.

Our shuttle service in Cape Town could not track the flight online and therefore had to arrive on time and wait for one hour which I paid extra for because it was the decent thing to do.\nParticularly our flight from Harare 11:45 Friday 13/07/2018 - the matrix board at departures stated the flight was on time even though the aircraft docked late and we only started boarding about 45 minutes after the stated time.(at least on this flight the cabin crew apologized for the late departure unlike the CPT-HRE flight) I think all passengers understand that these things happen but would just like to be informed instead of watching the gate operators joking around and playing on their phones. I sensed general disapproval of this behaviour and if Rwandair wishes to continue with this service would suggest that they pay attention to what is going on at the airports that they service. It is all about the perception of the consumer. We accept logistical issues but not disrespect!\nHaving said this the aircrew performed impeccably and saved the day!

Turkish, Emirates, Brussels Airlines business class all upwards of Euro 2,300. A colleague of mine recommended Rwandair having just used them from Gatwick, via Brussels...  I bought a return Business Class ticket to Entebbe (via Kigali) for Euro 1,540. The plane was the most recent Airbus 330-300, seats were lie-flat beds, equal to any top class airlines. I had wine with my dinner (we left Brussels at 22.30pm). I was a little disappointed that the same type of red wine were served (2 x Merlot). I would suggest having one Merlot and one Cabernet Sauvignon. There was a choice of 3 meals including vegetarian, which were good.. Cheese platter or sweet dessert were also available. Friendly staff but they do need to be a little more attentive... (however the smiling flight attendants were most welcome!) The entertainment system was very modern but there selection was very limited 15-20 films. We landed early (8am.) in Kigali and were transported in a luxuriously upholstered leather bus. The terminal is small and very practical. The business lounge was a 10 seconds walk from the boarding pass transit control. The lounge also had a wide range of food available and great Cappuccinos! Transfer was just over one hour and the security check was prompt and fast. The connecting flight was 35 minutes long... All in all, excellent value for money!

They deliberately did not include the new price on the website and only inform clients when they arrive at the airport. The updated information on the website still includes the previous fees for extra luggage but the website now indicates as follows:\n“The above rates apply to all East Africa routes except Nairobi. Please contact sales.nairobi@rwandair .com for the excess baggage rate for the route”\nAs such if you are travelling from Kenya to other states, the fees for extra luggage has been increased to more than three times the previous price.\nNow let me tell you about the unprofessional, manipulative and retaliatory nature of Rwandair.\nThis may be long but bear with me and take some time to read this...you may learn a lesson or two and then decide if you want to still fly using Rwandair.\n1. On 12 May 2018, my sister was traveling from Nairobi, Kenya to Cameron (Central Africa) on economy class with her son who was 1year 9 months. The flight was to leave at 5 am. She arrived at JKIA at 1am.\n2. She had two suit cases of 23 kg each as her entitled luggage. She also had extra luggage. When she arrived at the airport, she was checked in by the staff of Kenyan Airways. For some reason Rwandair uses staff from Kenyan airways for check in. She was informed by the check in staff that she would be required to pay extra luggage USD 8 dollars per kg instead of USD 3 as indicated on the Rwandair website. She was also informed that the total amount of money she would pay for each of the two extra 20kgs of luggage was USD 620.\n3. She explained to the ladies who were checking in, that according to Rwandair’s website she was required to pay USD 46 for each extra luggage of 23kgs for the route she was flying. The Kenya airways check in staff requested her to wait for the Rwandair staff to clarify further.\n4. Around 3am, Rwandair staff at the JKIA office arrived. As a regular traveler on the same route, I noticed the staff always arrived two hours to an international flight! She had already been informed by the ladies checking in (who called her on the phone) that my sister had insisted on paying USD 46 as indicated on the Rwandair website. The Rwandair staff member informed my sister that the information on the website had changed and my sister was required to pay USD 8 dollars (and a total of USD 620) for extra luggage.\n5. My sister called Rwandair office in Rwanda after talking to the JKIA staff who confirmed to her via telephone that extra luggage was USD 46 as indicated on the website. When she informed the JKIA staff of what Rwanda staff had confirmed, the JKIA staff showed her a document which was written ‘proposed fee for extra luggage for Rwandair’ and insisted payment had to be made on the basis of that document which had different fees from what was confirmed by Rwanda staff and indicated on Rwandair website.\n6. When I asked Rwandair later to share a copy of this document with me, they informed me that it was an internal document and they were not required to share with clients.\n7. My sister currently at terminal C, insisted that she was to pay USD 46; she was asked to go to Terminal 1D where she had checked in and talk to the sales officer. The sales officer agreed with my sister had to pay USD 46 but the reservation/check-in lady overruled him and insisted that my sister MUST pay as per the proposed fees.\n8. Since my sister had not budgeted for the extra cost and had been kept moving around the airport with a small baby from 1am, I had to physically go the airport and pay the extra amount to enable her travel to avoid any further delays as it was already 4:15am and departure was 5am\n9. At about 10am, I called Rwandair JKIA office to request for receipts for payment made for my sister. The sales officer issued and sent to me a receipt which he later nullified and sent another receipt with a different calculation for the payment made. When I requested for clarification as to the change in receipts, the sales officer clarified as follows;\n“The total amount of excess luggage per KG is USD 8.00 and 1 Piece of 23KGs extra is USD 150.00. for an extra luggage of 2 pieces of 23kgs each which is USD 150.00*2 total USD 300.00 plus an extra 40 Kilos which we charged USD 8.00 per Kilo, total USD 8.00*40 total is USD 320.00. The total amount that was paid is USD 620.00.”\n10. Later in the day, I escalated the issue to Rwanda office in writing and attachments which they replied to after ten (10) days. The Sales Manager Rwandair Kenya apologized for the issue and promised to have the issue resolved.\n11. Subsequently, the Sales Manager contacted me to propose that my sister be upgraded to business for her next flight to Kenya. They did not tell me that they would not refund the extra money we had spent. When I informed that I would agree to an upgrade and a refund they told me they could only upgrade her flight and would not refund the money. On 28 May 2018, I informed Rwandair that we wanted a refund and not an upgrade. I also requested Rwandair to provide a calculation of the refund that they were to pay.\n12. On 2 June 2018, the Sales Manager provided a calculation and requested whether the money could be redirected towards extra luggage on my sisters next trip. To which we informed them we wanted a refund as we had stated before.\n13. Following the issue on 12th May 2018, my sister made two visits to Kenya without the refund being settled and having paid USD 46 for extra luggage on both visits.\n14. On 26 June 2017, my sister travelled to Kenya from Cameroon and was due to return on 30 June 2018 still travelling through economy class. Again, she was at the airport at 1am and She informed me that she had called the Sales Manager and he informed her that a change had been made to the Rwandair website such that while the price for extra luggage from East Africa to Central Africa was still USD 46 the following wording had been included on the website:\n“The above rates apply to all East Africa routes except Nairobi. Please contact sales.nairobi@rwandair .com for the excess baggage rate for the route”\nShe was informed at the airport that she needs to pay USD 150 for every 23kgs of extra luggage!\n15. I called the Sales Manager at 3:30 am to request clarification as to what was happening. He informed me of the above disclaimer and I enquired why the rates were then not reflected on the website so that clients could be aware and prepared before going to the airport. He informed me that clients were to be informed of these changes once they arrived at the airport!!!! yes that’s what he said!!!!!!!!!\n16. Since it had taken him more than two months to process the 12th May 2018 refund, I requested him to immediately settle the refund in order to pay for the extra luggage cost at the airport to allow my sister board her flight. He requested me to write to him requesting that the refund be used for extra luggage. Knowing that I had no other choice I wrote to him requesting him to use the refund towards the extra luggage.

Despite having complied to all Rwandair requirements, my sister arrived Cameroon without any of her luggage’s. They accepted payment for the luggage but still left behind her entire suitcases in Nairobi Kenya as she departed for Douala, Cameroon.\nClearly, Rwandair have successfully managed to ascertain their consistent unprofessionalism, manipulative and retaliatory ways irrespective of being a frequent flyer.

It got off to a very bad start with an extremely slow and inefficient check-in process. Boarding was equally disorganized and the incoming flight delayed by an hour thus I missed the connection from Kigali to Abuja. Airport staff offered me an alternative to Nairobi to Addis to Abuja. I flatly refused. There were five of us who missed the connection and we were told they would have waited for us if we were ten. The staff were very polite and finally put us onto the flight to Lagos. We were met in Lagos by a very efficient manager but it was a mad rush to get onto a flight to Abuja without water or food being offered. We had been travelling for 14 hours by then. Finally arrived in Abuja and the airline offered to take me to my residence making me wait another 2 hours before we finally left the airport. Altogether disappointing and am uninspired to use them again. An 8 hour journey turned into 20 hours. I would have preferred to be given the option in Johannesburg not to take the flight and travel on another day since they already knew we could not make the connection.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/71/d9/02/travelwhiz58.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelwhiz58","crvsd":"Anu P wrote a review Jun 2018","ui_header_link":"Anu P","default":"Johannesburg, South Africa","phmbo":"17 contributions","phmbo1":"12 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Abuja","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r590646547-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Disappointing service","tehyy":"Date of travel: June 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Cabin crew were friendly enough on both flights. Timing of the flights was poor. Ended up taking off late from Entebbe meaning that I ended up being \"rushed\" through security.

Unpacked my entire carry on bag including my wallet. Not finding a lighter seemed to irritate him as he then decided to question me on carrying normal headache tablets.

I was already flying on Kenya Airways on other sectors (check out the reviews HERE), and had heard a lot about RwandAir so wanted to try their product; so decided to book a flight with them.  On the route I was flying, there was no price difference between the two carriers so there was no real incentive to fly them other than time preferences and trying new airlines.  Booking the ticket was easy and quick on the RwandAir website, as it was very user friendly and efficient.  On the website, I was only able to book the flight and request a special meal, but I was not able to pre-select my seat.  I completed my booking and received the confirmation in email.I wanted to confirm the special meal request as well as request a seat assignment, so I emailed the airline.  The airline got back to me a couple of days later and said that my meal request had been confirmed but that they could not confirm seat assignments until the day of the flight.  My flight departed Nairobi at 3:35p and was scheduled to arrive into Kigali at 4pm (the flight had originated from Entebbe and was stopping off in Nairobi before heading to Kigali).  The day before my flight, I was able to check-in online and during this process I was able to preselect my seat and receive my boarding pass.  On the day of my flight, I was stuck in Nairobi traffic so I reached out to the airline via social media to see what would happen if I missed my flight (as RwandAir has an afternoon and evening flight departure).  To this day I still have not received a response from them, but luckily I made it to the airport in time.  RwandAir provides two checked bags for free, but I only had one bag so check-in was very easy and efficient; my luggage was tagged and I received my boarding pass.The operating aircraft for this flight was a CRJ aircraft, which generally are small and tiny.  The aircraft was parked on an aircraft stand so boarding passes were collected in the airport and then we walked to the aircraft.  The aircraft was laid out in a 2-2 seat layout and generally the seats were comfortable and the legroom was extremely good (I am tall and I had more than enough legroom).  Boarding a bit chaotic as there was no order to the process, with everyone trying to board at once and people having difficulty finding their seats.  The attendants on board were not particularly interested in helping any of the passengers nor in speeding up the boarding process.  Boarding finally completed, the door was closed, manual safety demonstrations were conducted, and we taxied to the runway.  This is another instance where the attendants were not really paying attention as the passenger sitting next to me did not understand the safety demonstrations, did not understand English, and was sitting without her seatbelt on.  I motioned twice for the flight attendants but they seemed least bothered.  It was only while doing their final safety checks did I repeat the information to the flight attendant and they finally paid attention. While the plane is taxing to the runway I was made to switch to a bulkhead seat – and even here most airlines make you put your hand-carry in the overhead compartment to keep the aisle clear.  On this flight, the attendants seemed least bothered.  After waiting for a while we finally took off for the 1hr 25m flight time. Once we reached cruising altitude, the inflight service commenced.  The attendants came by with a drink cart and a meal cart.  Even though I had ordered a special meal and the special meal was delivered onboard, it was not marked for a particular seat assignment nor with my name.  Another passenger, who had not pre-ordered a special meal but requested one onboard was given my special meal.  When I asked for the meal, they said they only had one and it had been given away so the option was to give me the regular tray of the sides without the main meal; I passed on that option.  When the drink cart came, it was limited as it only had juice, water, and alcohol.  I asked for a soft drink and they said they did not have it nor could they get it for me so I ended just taking water.  In both the drink and meal service, the attendants attitude was a ‘take it or leave it’; they couldn’t care less.  After the service concluded, there was not much to do for the remainder of the flight.  There were no PTV screens nor any inflight entertainment system.  The seats had compartment up top which held the airline magazine, the airsickness bag, as well as the duty free catalog.  There was also a tray table below and another holder beneath that to store other items.  There were no USB ports and I could not find any electrical outlets either.   We started our descent into Kigali and the attendants came by to do their last safety checks, and again they really did not pay attention to seatbacks being upright nor to ensure everyone had their seatbelts on.We landed into Kigali generally on time and taxied to a stand (there are no airline bridges at Kigali International) and deplaned via the stairs.  The stairs on the plane are very narrow and can be slippery, especially when it is raining as it was in Nairobi, and because of that three passengers slipped and fell coming down the stairs.  For this reason, the airline made the passengers go down the stairs very slowly so deplaning took a while.  After deplaning we boarded the bus which took us to the arrivals hall.Overall, I was disappointed with my RwandAir flight.  I was really looking forward to their flight, as I was told by others about their good service and I see how active they are on social media.  Despite my high expectations, everything the flight was a miss.  The customer service was lacking, the inflight service was poor, and the overall experience was lacking.  The only positives about the experience was the ease of booking the flight and the generous legroom.  Given this experience, I would not choose to fly RwandAir again.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/ec/ef/5f/0504traveller.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0504Traveller","crvsd":"0504Traveller wrote a review May 2018","ui_header_link":"0504Traveller","default":"Kenner, Louisiana","phmbo":"4878 contributions","phmbo1":"498 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Nairobi - Kigali","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r577361383-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Poor Regional Flights","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I booked the ticket there was no mention of any additional stopovers apart from Kigali which i was quite pleased and content with. Only the morning of the flight did I find out that, at the check in counter that the flight from Nairobi stops over in Entebbe first. We departed Nairobi and stopped over in Entebbe for 45 minutes without getting off the plane. After reaching Kigali I was then informed that there was to be an additional stopover in Brussels. Again after landing in Brussels we were on the plane for about 1 hour and 15 minutes and then proceeded to Gatwick. by now I was totally drained and tired and regretting trying to save and booking this flight. On the way back was the same route without the Entebbe stopover. However when we were in Brussels, we were on the plane for over 2 hours due to some paperwork glitch and couldn't take off. The seats were very uncomfortable for such a long trip and the food was below average. The entertainment was also minimal and not many choices The only minor plus point was the service from the on board staff which I cannot complain about.

Covered with a warm blanket and the seat reclined to the max - footrest fully extended for added comfort - did I manage to sleep until the crew woke me up in time for breakfast. As the pictures show, a good variety, omelette included, a great way to wake up on board of a flight with a cup of tea served as a 'starter'.\nThe crew, having already flown the Kigali to Johannesburg sector, remained fresh and alert and SMILING throughout the flight, not once giving the impression they had already been on duty for close to 10 hours when landing in Kigali.\nI had a connecting flight home to Entebbe and that is when it got interesting. We left on time on a CRJ900 and the short hop to Entebbe was extended when very bad weather greeted us just minutes before landing. Safety first, the captain decided to go around and not land on first attempt and when landing showed excellent skills to keep the aircraft stable during heavy cross winds just before touchdown. My compliments to the cockpit crew for this bit of superb flying!\nThe cabin crew was very switched on and made sure seat belts were tight before landing, probably aware of the adverse weather conditions.\nI was served a cup of tea, freshly made, but if one word of constructive critique can be voiced, I preferred the nuts offerings to the crisps. Otherwise, two excellent flights on my return from South Africa.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado","crvsd":"Safariafficionado wrote a review Apr 2018","ui_header_link":"Safariafficionado","default":"Kampala, Uganda","phmbo":"3100 contributions","phmbo1":"490 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r575521539-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Flights three and four of this journey - free of any problems!","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Off the plane in Kigali, parked right in front of the terminal, were several RwandAir staff members at hand to fast track Johannesburg bound connecting passengers through the transit reporting point to the mandatory security check and straight on to the boarding gate.\nA dedicated business class passenger bus was at the ready to take myself and several more passengers to the aircraft. I asked on boarding to please let me know if my baggage has made the connection too and was, before doors were closed, assured that my baggage was on board.\nI have never transited so fast through Kigali for an onward connection and full credit to the airline to stay on top of short connections and facilitating passengers in such an exemplary manner.\nThe service was operated with a B737-800 and the cabin was clean, the crew on board warmly welcoming and besides proffering drinks before take off were earphones, a blanket and a vanity kit distributed, with a smile! Hot towels too were offered, thankfully accepted to wipe the sweat off my face.\nAfter reaching cruising altitude was dinner served and as the pictures show, a very presentable and tasty meal - my main course being a succulent chicken breast.\nThe three and a half hours passed quickly while I did some work, the sockets in the seat keeping my laptop powered up and recharging my tablet enroute to Johannesburg. Tea was served by the attentive crew throughout and my cup never stayed empty for more than a minute.\nRwandAir once again proved their mettle and remains, for me flying out of Entebbe, the fastest way to get to South Africa.

The cabins were clean but everything else was average or below average. The wifi advised is only for 15mins and there after its about $30 for 500mb. We had a stop over in Brussels that was supposed to be 50 mins and 2 hours later we were still to depart, i had to beg the cabin crew to give us food because it was almost 11pm and having departed Gatwick at 7 we were the children on-board were obviously hungry. The on-board entertainment is very very limited and to make it worse it was the same on the return flight so we didn't even bother switching the screens on. The food is not business class standards at all but as a new airline perhaps they are still trying to find their feet. The starter and main on the outboard leg was exactly the same as the inboard so nothing exciting there. The drinks are served of the large bottles both soft and alcoholic so the fizzy drinks turn to be flat and as the alcoholic i returned the glass i ordered of Amarula its just didnt taste right like it had been watered down or something (Perhaps left open too long) on our return leg we had another 2 hour delay on ground in Brussels and the ice malted so ordering a drink meant you get a flat warm drink. The cabin crew in business class did try their best to be attentive with limited resources. The connection in Kigali is very smooth speaking for business class passenger, a luxury bus collected us from the aircart reserved for business class passengers only and we were whisked through to the business class lounge which is very clean and most basics available. They have a play area for kids in the lounge to keep our little ones busy. We were collected from the lounge and assisted through security and to the connecting flight with no delay. On getting to Harare our 6 bags did not arrive, although this is something i was expecting as i had been warned by other passengers but its the lack of information that aggravated us most. Apparently from Kigali to Harare is a smaller aircraft so bags as left in Kigali to be transported on the next flight, this is totally understandable but if we were informed on arrival we could have saved ourselves 3 hours roaming aimlessly around the airport. Our bags did finally arrive the next day and im not sure if they had been left outside in the rain overnight but out belongings were soaking wet, i was so exhausted i did not even have the energy to ask for compensation. Overall considering the fare i paid i will class my experience as ok, had i paid more then the score would be lower as they say you get what you pay for. Would i fly Rwandair again YES (Because of the cheap fare) but this time i will be more prepared and will not expect much.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniquemN1320PR","crvsd":"Monique M wrote a review Apr 2018","ui_header_link":"Monique M","default":"","phmbo":"3 contributions","phmbo1":"","dmrsr":"London - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r573921810-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Average Flight","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In reality the flight out to Kigali was ok as was the remainder to Harare and the experience was very much similar to Ethiopian Airlines etc. Fairly basic but ok in the long run. Coming back from Harare however was not as good as we stopped at Brussels from Kigali. Supposedly for 50 minutes to refuel. We were there for about an hour and three quarters as the plane had lost the paperwork in order to leave the airport. This meant arriving late at Gatwick and we were worried about getting our booked taxi back to our house in Bedfordshire. We did but it put a bit of a dampner to the end of a very long journey. If you want a budget airline then this is ok. Plane was clean,food was standard, stewards were very helpful but when the captain says that you will be leaving in five minutes but 20 minutes later you are still there, well that's what budget airlines are about.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwe222019","crvsd":"Ian Duncan wrote a review Apr 2018","ui_header_link":"Ian Duncan","default":"Bedfordshire, United Kingdom","phmbo":"51 contributions","phmbo1":"9 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r573613377-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Average flight","tehyy":"Date of travel: March 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had two luggages one was overweight and one was underweight, I had asked the lady if they could balance it or at least reduce something. I choose this airline because of their higher baggage allowance but unfortunately I had a small suitcase that couldn't reach 23kg. She would not allow me to distribute the excess weight of the large suitcase onto the small one even though her coworkers were telling her she could do that. Although I understand they don't have to balance out the weight it was frustrating to hear that she could have if she was just willing to. The worst part was when she charged for my overweight bag. She kept claiming it was 7kgs over when it was only 6kgs. She finally agreed and I paid. At the time I was really frustrated and she had told me to go through security then I would get my receipt and change. When I got it I realized she charged by the 7kgs instead of the 6kgs. I saw her after and confronted her about this and said she was taking advantage of me and she said she wasn't because it's on the receipt. She had no regret or sympathy. I don't know why she would even want to overcharge me. The rest of the flight was good but she really ruined the experience for me. I am discouraged from using this airline again if I don't have to.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer321864","crvsd":"reviewer321864 wrote a review Apr 2018","ui_header_link":"reviewer321864","default":"Moshi, Tanzania","phmbo":"1 contribution","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Entebbe - Kilimanjaro National Park","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r572266139-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Poor Customer Service","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2018","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

As soon as we boarded our already late flight in Doula, we were headed for alot of bad news. At Doula an airline steward asked us why we booked our layover for so long in Kigali... “What do you mean?” I asked and explained that when you book online you have no control over layovers. This friendly guy understood and advised that at Kigali we should inform the first steward we met about this issue. Apparently when we landed at Kigali they had a flight at midnight and was stunned that we didn’t book this flight. We were even more stunned that they were stunned and even more so that they insisted that it was somehow our fault. My baby daughter was more irritable and just wanted a nap. They refused to pay for the transit hotel and insisted we sleepover in the airport lobby. So many other airlines go through this same sort of issue and we were shocked to find them unprepared to offer this.

The plane for the Gatwick - Kigali leg was a modern Airbus A330 complete with on-board WiFi (15 mins free per leg) and individual screens with a selection of films.

The tickets were relatively affordable and the flight had a stopover in Kigali on both legs. On the first leg of the journey, the plane was quite small so it felt a little bit crowded and there was no in-flight entertainment. The air hosts were not very pleasant but they were not rude.\nFor the return leg we were delayed for 1 hour in Johannesburg and 3 hours in Kigali.

I left it exactly on my seat, inside the beauty kit that the crew provided us with for traveling in business. I realized my phone’s loss after one hour and 15 minutes, so I immediately called rwandair while heading back to the airport. They told me they would have sent somebody to check. I spent two hours at the airport, no one was able to understand the import info that my phone was just inside the kit and I don’t know if they simply were not able to understand (which is a problem if you work in an airport), or if they just didn’t want to. I spoke with many people from the security, I sent an  email as they suggested me to do even If I was there in person, standing in front of them. I made calls, trying to find more competent people than the ones there...and after two hours their answer was always “they’re still looking”. Of course, how much time do you need to check on a single sit, inside a kit??! At the end they told me they couldn’t find it, and since my phone was 100% there , and since after me no one beside the rwandair staff have had access to the business class area, they admitted that for sure somebody of the cleaners had found my phone and kept it. I came back to the airport two times after that they, both times for hours, blaming them to have stolen my phone and no one was able to help me. I just received answers as “ok, I’m going to ask”/ “I’m going to investigate on the cleaning staff”...nothing more. It’s incredible that they were not able to find the person of their own staff that stole my phone...they just didn’t care! And because of them I lost a phone of the value of 850 € (900,000 FRW) and no one is going to pay for that. Of course I was the one forgetting the phone, but from a flag’s carrier you expect for sure a more responsible behavior. Furthermore, after shearing this story with some people, I discovered that it was not the first time that something got stolen on their aircraft by the staff. iPads, sunglasses, expensive watches...everything magically disappears when forgot in their flights. I won’t never fly again with them, I spent so much money flying in business and this is how they pay their costumers back.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eledettori","crvsd":"Eleonora wrote a review Feb 2018","ui_header_link":"Eleonora","default":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","phmbo":"20 contributions","phmbo1":"19 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Dubai - Kigali","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r562778023-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Dishonest people!

Their cabin crew were attentive and professional as well as friendly to make me settle in comfortably.  the in-flight meal offered two choices of meals and fulfilled it's purpose - from keeping you from starving.  Although nothing special it was fresh and well prepared - and therefore nothing to complain about either.  We arrived on time in Dubai with time to spare - again, nothing to complain about.

This explanation is always bemusing given that it is one airline.\n\nAgain the best thing that could be said was that the cabin was in very good condition and not surprisingly so given the plane is less than a year old. The business section was not very full so we expected lots of attention from the cabin crew but this was not be the case.\n\nWe had ordered a vegtarian meal and were served up what was clearly lunch for breakfast. I suggested as much to the steward but he was insistent. For some reason hash browns with grilled mushrooms and baked beans were not considered suitable for a vegatrian breakfast but fried bananas and chickpeas were. At lunch we were served the same sauce with rice confirming that we were indeed served the lunch offering for breakfast.\n\nUnlike the normal business class where staff are almost pestering to serve you drinks and snacks this was not to be on this particular flight. When I asked for water at one stage the steward seemed to remember he should have been serving the passengers and clutched several bottles and went through the cabin offering water to everyone. The sleep quality was good given the flat bed fold out of the seat.\n\nThe on board entertainment system is sparsely populated if one is being kind, if you are able to carry your own content do so. The inflight wifi did not work on the outward leg of the journey whilst on the return leg it did work albeit for 15 minutes whereupon you could purchase a limited bundle that was also time limited.\n\nOur return flight also left nearly an hour and a half late, again for the same reason that our initial flight was late, someone keeps taking these planes for a joyride it would seem.\nThe cabin was once again sparsely populated and the meal service more in line with the offerings in economy which was packed. We were even served a meaty salad with our vegetarian meal which is always a nice touch.\n\nOur return flight was topped off with the discovery that our luggage did not return with us. Thankfully it all came in intact albeit a day late and was delivered to our door.\n\nOne would struggle to find a business class ticket to the UK from Equatorial Africa at a price that is no more than 50% over economy on most of the other airlines and that is perhaps the best thing that can be said of this airline. In all other aspects they are very much still finding their feet with their marketing department clearly doing a much better job than their training, customer care and ground handling departments. If all you need is the extra legroom, a flatbed seat, and use of a lounge at the airport plus some queue jumping then for the price this is the airline for you.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lumumbaw","crvsd":"lumumba w wrote a review Feb 2018","ui_header_link":"lumumba w","default":"Sutton, United Kingdom","phmbo":"58 contributions","phmbo1":"8 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Entebbe - London","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r557854505-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Still finding their feet","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Top marks for that Rwandair.  The planes were really clean and well kept and the cabin crew the same.  Top marks Rwandair.  Unfortunately the crew on our trip out were rather automated with no charm or customer service.  They were performing a duty and didn't look that happy about it either.  Never mind, we got there in one piece, fed and watered relatively adequately, but having endured the worst flight I have ever encountered on account of the incessantly screaming babies both directly in front and behind.  Not your fault Rwandair, however you could have asked the parents if they needed anything for their babies like putting the economy lights out earlier to encourage sleep (Business Class were allocated a dark environment earlier but perhaps they had to pay extra for that).  Then we arrived but our luggage didn't.  We waited 24 hours for it and had to pay a taxi to go and collect it the next day.  It was a good thing we were staying in Nairobi because if we were off anywhere on a safari, we would have had no clothes and no Christmas presents. I'm still waiting for Rwandair to get back to me about refunding me the 3,000KSH for the taxi fare.  I have had responses but completely off-subject and now I am being ignored.  I am not a difficult person, just want back what is due please.The journey back was done in leapfrog flights.  I don't mind roughing it a bit so the 15 hours total flying time was OK if a little tiring.  The Kenyan crew that took us as far as Rwanda were lovely - smiley, chatty and helpful.  Then the automated ones got on to take us to the UK.  Our pilot needed a few more practices at landing - we seemed to thud each time but again we did land, got all our baggage this time (thanks to the Kenya Airways ground stewardess who made sure each one had PRIORITY on it this time) and that was that.  I understand from the ground crew in Nairobi that left luggage at either Brussels or Rwanda is a daily occurrence so I would recommend that Rwandair get their act together on this.  I cannot believe that they are not receiving claims every day and also angry passengers who were not so fortunate as ourselves.

Next time I will pay more to fly with a different airline, on the way from London to Johannesburg the flight proceeded to stop in Brussels, Kigali, Lusaka and finally Johannesburg with a delay in Kigali and additional time added to the journey from all the stops. This caused a missed connecting flight once in Johannesburg of which Rwandair office in JHB wanted to know nothing about. In addition to this online check in allows you to pick your seats only for them to be changed once boarding passes are sent through. I found the planes to be in good order being new and the on board staff to be pleasant, however there is little to be said about the ground staff/customer service working for Rwandair, at the counters and well as over the phone. trying to call the head office in Kigali and office is JHB  the phone just rings out. Overall the money spent due to missed connecting flight and the time delays together with misleading information regarding flights will not see be flying Rwandair again in a hurry.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1319DOemmam","crvsd":"Emma M wrote a review Jan 2018","ui_header_link":"Emma M","default":"","phmbo":"6 contributions","phmbo1":"7 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r551676019-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Disappointing","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Once in Kigali the security checks are pathetically slow with two machines operating for checking bags this process to go through the security took over an hour going to London and returning to JHB. On the way to London we were informed there would be a stop in Brussels, the first we heard of this was once we boarded the flight. On the way back to JHB we stopped in Brussels and to our surprise there was a stop in Lusaka after leaving Kigali. Again with no prior knowledge. We specifically booked the flight because because it was a one stop with short layovers had we known about all the stops we would have booked another flight. The aircraft was clean and tidy however the on board entertainment was very limited. There was also no control over the amount of hand luggage this also caused delays with cabin crew trying to find place for passengers luggage.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rorye358","crvsd":"rorye358 wrote a review Jan 2018","ui_header_link":"rorye358","default":"","phmbo":"2 contributions","phmbo1":"2 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - London","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r550792655-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Delays on all flights","tehyy":"Date of travel: December 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Since it was my first, I am not sure how to rate this one. This is why, checking in at O R Tambo International (in Johannesburg) went smoothly. The in-flight service was great as the cabin crew was friendly which, I appreciated. However, my landing in Kigali was not as great. After going through passport control, I got to the carousel to collect my luggage and noticed that my luggage is not there. I eventually went to the luggage office to enquire about this. After checking on the system (as he put it), the very serious guy who assisted me said that my luggage is still in Johannesburg and it was never loaded onto the flight. Now at this moment, there was no point in getting angry because my luggage was not going to magically appear but what brought on my indifference was that when I asked him if they would deliver my luggage to the hotel (since I am in a foreign country), he noted that it is not possible at all. Hence, I am not sure how to rate this airline. First impression is lasting impression after all but then again, the in flight service was great. At this moment, if I don't use the airline in the near future it wouldn't be a complete  train smash but not completely apposed to using it again (at some point)...","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalGradwell","crvsd":"CrystalGradwell wrote a review Dec 2017","ui_header_link":"CrystalGradwell","default":"Pretoria, South Africa","phmbo":"7 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Kigali","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r544916475-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Uncertain of rating...","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They have greatly improved a number of their services and are serious about becoming an airline of note.

More buns, and butter, was offered when the main course was served, then followed by a plate of select cheeses and rounded up by an offering of dessert.\nIf I had to add anything it would be offering a printed menu to passengers to be aware of the meal choices before the service which would be the icing on the cake no doubt for many passengers.\nUpon landing was my jacket returned immediately without having to ask for it.\nThe aircraft was parked close to the arrival building, no need for a bus and within a few steps was I inside the building, reached the transfer desk and had my onward boarding pass from Kigali to Entebbe stamped.\nTransit was 'rapid', only a short queue at the Business Class / VIP security lane - this puts Entebbe airport to shame where no such facilities exist - and I boarded my last sector flight home which took just over half an hour from take off to landing. Connecting with RwandAir to West Africa and to Southern Africa clearly is the fastest option for a passenger from Uganda and I have no hesitation to book WB again for future flights to these parts of Africa.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado","crvsd":"Safariafficionado wrote a review Nov 2017","ui_header_link":"Safariafficionado","default":"Kampala, Uganda","phmbo":"3100 contributions","phmbo1":"490 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lagos - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r544333282-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"The fastest connection from Lagos to Entebbe, via Kigali","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Same procedures of course but notably a notch friendlier and certainly no queues to get to the boarding gate. The plane was parked nearby and I was able to walk to the stairs and a ground staff again fast tracked my boarding when seeing my C-class boarding pass.\nWhen entering the plane I was warmly greeted and told by a cabin crew member that I was free to move to a window seat of my choice as the load on the day was light upfront.\nCaptain Cobbina Kojo even greeted me - other passengers too - before he returned to the cockpit to complete his preflight checks.\nPurserette Laetitia Umuzayire and her colleague Edwige Munezero were as keen as cabin crew ever come, a delight to be served by them.\nOn the flight to Lagos was a full breakfast offered, with a choice of buns and/or pastries, freshly cut fruits - no seeds at all in the water melon slices!!! - and then followed by an omelette with baked beans and notably roasted gonja, a type of sweet banana, adding local flavour to the morning meal. I was even asked if I'd wanted some more food but politely declined.\nI had mentioned to Miss Laetitia that I would like my tea cup to be refilled ever so often and she did exactly that while I concentrated to first scan through the entertainment channels before deciding to read a book I brought. Time flew by and the four hour flight was over in no time.\nA warm good bye and hope to see you again, delivered by both front cabin crew, made for a very pleasant exit.\nAnother excellent flight with RwandAir!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado","crvsd":"Safariafficionado wrote a review Nov 2017","ui_header_link":"Safariafficionado","default":"Kampala, Uganda","phmbo":"3100 contributions","phmbo1":"490 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - Lagos","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r542736108-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Excellent service on board RwandAir's Airbus A330-300","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I woke about an hour into the flight was the crew led by purser Robert Rwigema prompt at hand and offered me my dinner and then served me tea. I appreciated the courtesy to let me sleep rather, as regularly experienced elsewhere, wake me because it was time to eat! I surely appreciated that thoughtfulness.\nUpon landing in Kigali I had the opportunity to sample the new business class bus which really added a new service dimension for RwandAir on the ground. Refreshing to see that what has been asked of other airlines in Africa by premium passengers was implemented first by RwandAir, taking the lead again and shaming other, older and more established airlines which habitually talk but rarely act.\nThe wait for my final leg from Kigali to Entebbe was spent in the Pearl Lounge and a RwandAir ground staff called me as the flight was boarding. A separate security channel for business class passengers saw me literally walk through the check, no queues, and directly on to the waiting bus.\nThe CRJ900 on this service took only 35 minutes to Entebbe but gave the crew enough time to serve me tea.\nGreat two flights with RwandAir and I will sample them again later this week when I fly to Lagos with them!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado","crvsd":"Safariafficionado wrote a review Nov 2017","ui_header_link":"Safariafficionado","default":"Kampala, Uganda","phmbo":"3100 contributions","phmbo1":"490 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lusaka - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r542078167-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"The business class passenger bus from the aircraft to the terminal in Kigali was the icing on the cake","tehyy":"Date of travel: November 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The crew, despite the early hour - take off was set for 06.30 a.m. - was cheerful and prompt with both Purser Nsoro Aine and his colleague Ange Inkindi really 'fussing' over their passengers. The flight is just over half an hour but I got my tea and a refill, what more can one wish for.\nTransit in Kigali is one of short ways and then, depending on the connection time, either spending some time in the lounge or else proceeding through security and waiting for the flight to be called for boarding.\nDue to the murky situation in Zimbabwe on the day was the original Lusaka - Harare service 'merged' with Johannesburg and Harare got cancelled.\nA bus transfer from the terminal to the aircraft spares one the walk and just like on my first leg flight, when on board the crew immediately swung into action.\nPurser Venest Musoni and his colleagues served me a hot breakfast after reaching cruising altitude, had my tea cup refilled at all times and were utterly professional with a permanent smile.\nWhat more can one wish for ...

Airport check is a bit like Air Zimbabwe in the old days, friendly, helpful but slightly chaotic. Lounge at Gatwick absolutely fine for a non-legacy African carrier. Aircraft clean with good choice of seats available as only 6 pax in J-Class. Try to get 2H or 4H as these are sheltered from the aisle as are a number of others which is more peaceful. The premium economy cabin was empty. No water bottle in the seat pockets however no shortage of drinks on request including pleasant NV champagne. No menu's provided however starter of unknown origin was tasty and a main offering of chicken or beef followed by a desert or cheese was very adequate. Lie flat seat is Vantage XL and super comfy. Entertainment was limited but at least the system worked. Headsets were okay. Breakfast was hot, fresh and very good. Washrooms on board very clean but missing hings such as drinking water cups and wet wipes.Transit in Kigali still focused on security and irrespective of class of travel if you are in transit you are manhandled through the system without any mention that the Business Lounge and washroom facilities are before the security check. Rwandair need to get on top of that especially where business passengers are concerned. Connecting flight to Harare was switched from CRJ to B737-800 - no complaints as 2:2 seating in business. Attentive service including light meal and snacks. A brief well managed stop in Lusaka and only real disappointment was lack of Rwandair staff in the arrivals lounge nor priority luggage delivery for Business class.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Capt_Coleman_M","crvsd":"Coleman M wrote a review Oct 2017","ui_header_link":"Coleman M","default":"Harare, Zimbabwe","phmbo":"70 contributions","phmbo1":"41 helpful votes","dmrsr":"London - Harare","dmrsr2":"International","dmrsr3":"Business Class","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r532920175-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Very good for a national carrier in Africa","tehyy":"Date of travel: October 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Even though it was a short flight I was apprehensive about the seating and dreaded being sqaushed in one position for an hour.

Sadly this key thing for good service expected from an airline has for the past year been nonexistent. The final straw for me was on the 3rd of August. Flight was planned to depart from OR Tambo at 2h55AM, arrive at 6h45am in Kigali and the Rwandair ticket office than booked my connecting flight to leave at 7h30am. The flight at OR Tambo left an hour and around 30 mins late. So ofcourse I missed my connecting flight. Good customer service would expect that Rwandair would try find a solution to ensure that the customer is comfortable and gets the quickest connecting flight due to their fault. But no I was told I could not get a flight that was leaving around 8h00 (even though offered to pay difference) as it was too late to embark, but yet for a full hour after my arrival at Kigali the attendants were searching for missing passengers. Secondly we were than left to sit till 16h30 waiting for connecting flight instead of offered somewhere to rest.\n\nA complaint was done to Rwandair which they acknowledged receipt and gave the general polite responses but that was it. Rather go for Kenya Airways going forward","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/05/2d/db/ariane-b.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arianeb220","crvsd":"Ariane B wrote a review Aug 2017","ui_header_link":"Ariane B","default":"Bujumbura Mairie Province, Burundi","phmbo":"11 contributions","phmbo1":"1 helpful vote","dmrsr":"Johannesburg - Bujumbura","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r518776504-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Final time traveling on it","tehyy":"Date of travel: August 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They need to look into the uniform and training of their crew though. The uniform is soo dull and the finishing quite poor. We checked in online for the 4 flights we were taking with my family and on two instances they changed our seats without notice to us. After suffering the inconvenience the first time, we made sure to check our next boarding tickets and we noted that the seats we had booked were different from those we were given at physical check-in. We asked why and the explanation is that they had changed the type of the aircraft we'll be traveling in and so the seating arrangement we used to check-in online was invalid. The courteous thing however would have been to notify us when we presented our printed boarding passes and show us the available seats for us to select. Instead, they just selected other seats (nowhere near where we had earlier selected) and gave us the tickets.\nWe also had a very bad experience in one of the flights where our baby started nosebleeding. We asked for help from one of the cabin crew. We waited for about 5 minutes and when he did not show up, i went to find out what had happened only to find him comfortably seated down. When i complained, he told me that he thought i had gone to use the toilet at the rear. Why he made that assumption i don't know as my problem was not accessing the toilet. We needed help to stop the bleeding which had been going on for almost 10minutes. Though another cabin crew heard me complaining and came to assist us, i'm still very disappointed that a member of the cabin crew would be asked for help in a matter especially involving a toddler and comfortably go back to his seat without any concern for the distress of the parent and the child.

It's a long flight and something that you settle yourself to endure rather than enjoy.  Staff were wonderful - giving parents of little children a break by occupying the little ones with soft toys - giving one lady who was concerned about swelling ankles a foot rub.... a foot rub!!! can you imagine any other airline giving this kind of care! Cabin crew were so keen to promote their lovely country and clearly thrilled to be given the freedom to offer top end customer service. (I read in the magazine that this was a 'thing'...it works).  Food was of a very high standard - particularly from LGW - eg. broccoli was actually green rather than the usual grey.  Kigali is basic but functional as a stop over and things there seem professional and efficient.  I paid a very tiny amount for this flight but would be prepared to pay considerably more in future if this level of service is maintained.  I've flown to JNB by every conceivable route - Dubai, Istanbul, Libya, Italy, Amerstam, Frankfurt, Luanda and more - friends were concerned at my choice of Kigali - there was no need.

Anyone who knows this country and its recent history has to believe that they will accomplish this. But they are definitely not there yet. Their fleet is new; I flew to and from Kigali on spotless, up-to-date Boeing 737's (700 and 800 series). Their cabin and ground staff are friendly and helpful, but the cabin staff often seemed uncertain. Food in economy was mediocre even by economy standards. The movie on my return trip was originally in English but shown only with a dubbed French soundtrack, and there was no onscreen flight-tracking map. Their website is terrible. You can't select seats for economy flights, so I used their South Africa agent to obtain pre-assigned seats. But that still didn't work for my return flight, where I was assigned the wrong seat in spite of the agent's promise and two advance calls to their Kigali office. Also, their website won't accept credit cards with a different billing address. I would choose RwandAir again over Kenya Airways for flights to Kigali, but not for longer journeys at this point.","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/74/22/c5/phil-c.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598PhilC","crvsd":"Phil C wrote a review Apr 2017","ui_header_link":"Phil C","default":"Falls Church, Virginia","phmbo":"218 contributions","phmbo1":"107 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Kigali - Johannesburg","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r478165959-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"Good potential but not yet world class","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2017","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We did ask what will happen - we told don't worry the plane will wait for you - I think there were 5-7 passengers affected.\n\nOur plane landed and we headed down the steps. At the same time, baggage handlers had clambered into our plane, to get our luggage. At the foot of the steps was a bus. We climbed on and off went the bus, racing across the tarmac. We reached another plane - our connecting flight. Not sure whether the baggage had beaten us there. Up the steps we went.\n\nWe smiled at the other passengers who'd waited for us. We sat down, we strapped in, and off we went.\n\nCan't have been 3 minutes plane to plane.\n\nWOW - 3 cheers for Rwandair!!!","Image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/60/74/dd/mrrlstephen.jpg","Avatar_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrrlstephen","crvsd":"mrrlstephen wrote a review Aug 2016","ui_header_link":"mrrlstephen","default":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","phmbo":"199 contributions","phmbo1":"91 helpful votes","dmrsr":"Lusaka - Entebbe","dmrsr2":"Africa","dmrsr3":"Economy","qwuub_URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729140-r400920473-RwandAir-World.html","qwuub":"We changed planes to our connecting flight like a F1 Grand Prix type change!!!","tehyy":"Date of travel: April 2016","xcjrc":"This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
